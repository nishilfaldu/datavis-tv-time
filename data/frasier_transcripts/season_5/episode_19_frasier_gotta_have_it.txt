    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa.
    The cafe is packed.  Frasier and Roz are sitting at a table when 
    Niles comes in.
    _
      **Niles:** Frasier, Roz!  Uh, I'd join you, but there's not a chair--
        **Roz:** Oh, actually I was just leaving.  You can have mine.
    _As Roz gets up, Niles reaches into his jacket._
        **Roz:** Niles! [_grabs his arm_] Every time I give you my chair, 
             you wipe it off first.  It's just insulting!
      **Niles:** For your information, I was reaching for my cell phone.
    _Roz lets go.  His hand comes out with his phone, and he starts dialing._
        **Roz:** Oh.  I'm sorry, Niles.  I stepped out of line.  See you later, 
             Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Bye-bye, Roz.
    _Roz leaves.  The phone behind the counter rings._
     **Waiter:** Cafe Nervosa.
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] Yes, this is Dr. Crane at Table Seven.  Could 
             you send someone over to dust off my chair?
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake!  I'll do it!
    _He snatches Niles's handkerchief and wipes the chair down.  
    Niles protests, checking out the window for Roz._
    **Frasier:** That's the most ridiculous thing I've seen in my entire life!  
             Stop it, just sit down!
    _They sit.  A waiter brings Frasier's coffee._
      **Niles:** May I have one of those, please? [_to Frasier_] So, I understand 
             you had a full dance card this weekend?
    **Frasier:** Yes, indeed.  I met a lovely young artist at the gallery  
             opening on Saturday.  We went out for coffee afterwards, 
             and our date lasted until, well... the cows didn't actually 
             come home, but I did hear mooing on the front porch! [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** Wait, I'm drawing a blank.  The only woman I remember you 
             chatting with at the gallery was the one in the Birkenstocks 
             who went on and on about her driftwood collages. [_sniggers_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's Caitlin.
      **Niles:** Oh!
    **Frasier:** Well, obviously we seem different on the surface.  But once 
             you get to know her, trust me, she is really a breath of 
             fresh air.  God, I haven't felt this excited about a 
             relationship in ages!
      **Niles:** Well, that's wonderful, Frasier! [_the waiter brings his 
             coffee_] Thank you.  So, is she from around here?
    **Frasier:** Oh, it didn't come up.
      **Niles:** Oh, I see.  Well, uh, where'd she go to school?
    **Frasier:** She didn't mention it.
      **Niles:** Probably art school.
    **Frasier:** Well, yes.
      **Niles:** Being an artist, I'm sure she is enthusiastic about the 
             finer things -- literature, music...
    **Frasier:** Uh, I don't know, we never got around to that.
      **Niles:** You know what, I think I'm putting you on the spot here.  
             Let's just leave it at congratulations on your new... 
             _relationship._
    **Frasier:** What are you implying?
      **Niles:** Oh, I think we both know what kind of _relationship_ we're 
             talking about.
    **Frasier:** Would you stop saying the word "relationship" that way? -- 
             _relationship._
      **Niles:** I'm not condemning you for your little... _fling_ --
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake.
      **Niles:** Just don't try to pass it off as something deeper than it is.  
             The only thing you two have in common is the faint impression 
             of the word "Sealy" on your backsides.
    **Frasier:** Listen, Niles, I would never stay in a relationship if I 
             didn't think there was some real future in it.
      **Niles:** In other words, if you were to realize that the two of you had 
             nothing in common beyond the physical, you'd break it off?
    **Frasier:** Yes, absolutely!  In a heartbeat!  It's a principle of mine -- 
             you know, this topic comes up all the time on my show.  What 
             do I always say?
      **Niles:** Um...
    **Frasier:** Surely you must listen occasionally!
      **Niles:** Of course I listen occasionally.  It's just I'm usually busy 
             between eleven and one.
    **Frasier:** My show is on from two to five.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Apartment
    Martin and Daphne are in the kitchen.  While Daphne leans out the 
    doorway, Martin places a candle on a cupcake.
    _
     **Martin:** I can't wait to see the look on his face.
     **Daphne:** Me, too.  He doesn't have a clue.
     **Martin:**[_lights the candle_] Good.  All set.
    _In the living room, Frasier is setting the table for dinner.  Martin 
    and Daphne come out with the cupcake, singing:_
    **Martin/Daphne:** Happy birthday to you...
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God.
    _They walk past Frasier to Eddie, who is sitting in Martin's Armchair.  
    Martin puts the cupcake in front of Eddie, while Daphne fits a tiny 
    party hat over his head._
    **Martin/Daphne:** Happy birthday, Dear Eddie,
                   Happy birthday to you!
     **Martin:** OK, let's do it together.
    _He puts his face next to Eddie's and makes a small puff.  The candle 
    goes out._
     **Martin:** Good boy!  Great!  That was terrific!
    _The doorbell rings._
     **Daphne:** I wonder if he made a wish?
    **Frasier:** I know I did.
    _Frasier opens the door to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.  Dad, Daphne, step lively!  We don't want 
             to miss the previews.
     **Martin:** In a minute.  Come on, birthday boy, I haven't given you 
             your present yet! [_confidentially, to the boys_] I got him 
             a brand-new rubber eeseburger-chay.
    _He carries Eddie to his room._
      **Niles:** So, Frasier, can we convince you to join us?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane.  Your brother's been slaving 
             away in the kitchen all afternoon.
    **Frasier:** Actually, I'm having Caitlin over for dinner.
      **Niles:** Oh... for _dinner_.
    _The doorbell rings again._
    **Frasier:** I'll thank you to stop with your sniggering insinuations 
             that Caitlin and I share nothing but the physical!  There 
             are many things that we do share. [_opens door_] Caitlin!
    _Caitlin -- a brunette in her twenties with a decidedly hippie style of 
    dress -- throws her arms around Frasier's neck and kisses him deeply.
    _
      **Niles:**[_to Daphne_] Now they're sharing a Tic-Tac.
    _They break apart._
    **Frasier:** Let me take your coat. [_hangs it up_] Oh, you remember Niles, 
             of course.  And this is Daphne, Caitlin.
    **Caitlin:**[_shaking hands_] Hello.
     **Daphne:** Hello.  Don't worry, we'll be out of your way in a minute, 
             just as soon as I can tear Mr. Crane away from Eddie.
    **Frasier:** Yes, he's having a little birthday party for his dog.
    **Caitlin:** Oh, how old is he?
    **Frasier:** Too old to be having a birthday party for his dog.  Anyway, 
             can I interest you a drink?  I've just opened a bottle of 
             Conte de Bruillet!
    **Caitlin:** Oh, you must have been saving it.  Burgogne hasn't made a 
             decent Beaujolais in years.
    **Frasier:**[_smugly_] Well, do you hear that, Niles?  Our Caitlin is a 
             fellow oenophile!
    _Frasier pours two glasses._
    **Caitlin:** When I was little, my father owned a vineyard.   I was the 
             only kid on the block who would open a can of Hawaiian punch 
             and let it breathe!
    **Frasier:** And we share that same quirky sense of humor! [_offers second 
             glass_] Would you care for a glass?
    **Caitlin:** No thanks.  Actually, I've always hated the taste of wine.
      **Niles:** Finally, something I can use to tell you two apart. [_takes 
             the glass_]
    **Frasier:** A martini, then?
    **Caitlin:** I cut out alcohol last year, along with processed sugar, dairy 
             products and meat... Oh, I hope I'm not screwing up your menu!  
             What are you serving?
    **Frasier:** Well, so far, parsley.  But we'll make do.  Let me get you a 
             glass of mineral water.
    **Caitlin:** Thanks.
    **Frasier:** Please, help yourself to the melon slices.  Just... 
             unwind the prosciutto.
    _He goes to the kitchen.  Niles follows him._
      **Niles:** Frasier, I owe you an apology.  You two are perfectly 
             compatible.  How long will it be before we're all standing 
             outside a wedding chapel, pelting you both with whole-grain 
             brown rice?
    **Frasier:** Spare me your sarcasm.
      **Niles:** Oh, come on.  Let me have my fun.  You're certainly having 
             yours, even if you deny that that's what you're doing.
    **Frasier:** Niles, I've already told you, I would never continue in a 
             relationship if I didn't think there was a real future, and 
             I happen to believe that there is in this one!  Have you 
             ever heard of "opposites attracting?"  Where I am worldly, 
             Caitlin is... unspoiled.
      **Niles:** Rather remarkable, given her terror of preservatives.
    _They come out of the kitchen.  Caitlin is standing with Martin and 
    Daphne._
    **Caitlin:** Oh, Frasier, I just met your dad!  Did you know we're both 
             Libras?
     **Martin:** Which explains why I'm so "perky, open-minded, and quick to 
             tears."
    **Caitlin:** And don't forget "Outgoing."
     **Martin:** No, I didn't. [_heads for the door_] All right, everybody 
             coming?
    **Caitlin:** Well, it was nice meeting you all!
      **Niles:** Yes, nice to meet you too, Caitlin.
    **Frasier:** I'll walk you to the door.
      **Niles:** All right.
    **Frasier:**[_whispering_] Will you stop smirking!  It's going to take more 
             than a harmless dabbling in astrology to dim the charm of this 
             appealing young woman.
    _Caitlin sits in Martin's Armchair and reclines backward._
    **Caitlin:** Oh my God!  This is the coolest chair!
    **Frasier:**[_off Niles' look_] Just get out!
    _He pushes Niles out and closes the door.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **DON JUAN IN HELL**
    _Scene Three -- Frasier's Apartment
    The next morning.  Frasier is sitting on the piano bench, nursing a 
    cup of coffee.  He looks preoccupied.  Martin comes out.
    _
     **Martin:** Morning, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Morning, Dad.
     **Martin:** What's the matter?
    **Frasier:** It's Caitlin.  I'm in hell.  Last night I experienced the 
             most intense physical pleasure I've ever known.
     **Martin:** Frasier, before you continue, I shared my bed last night 
             with a dog.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's not the problem, Dad.  It's just that there's 
             absolutely no future for me and Caitlin.
     **Martin:** Well, I got to say I never thought there was.  She's a flake.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's not the point.  Granted, there are aspects of 
             her personality that I find off-putting--
     **Martin:** Like her being a flake.
    **Frasier:** Well, all right!  It's just difficult to walk away from 
             something so intoxicating.
     **Martin:** Fras, I'm just gonna say one thing: watch out for this woman.  
             I know how these things work.
    **Frasier:** You've experienced something like this?
     **Martin:** I didn't say that.  I just know the type.  Today she's got you 
             going against your better judgment.  Pretty soon, you'll be 
             thinking about her all the time -- losing sleep, missing work, 
             neglecting your friends... [_drifting off_] and then pretty soon 
             you'll get caught naked with her in the backseat of your squad 
             car... [_snaps back_] But anyway, the point is, the longer you 
             put this thing off, the harder it's going to be to end it.
    **Frasier:** You're absolutely right, Dad.  Got to nip this thing in the 
             bud.  I'm going to go over there right now.  Doing anything 
             else would just make me a hypocrite. [_gets up and heads for 
             the door_] You know, just yesterday I dedicated an entire 
             theme show to the importance of self-control.
     **Martin:** You did?
    **Frasier:** Doesn't _anybody_ listen? 
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Caitlin's Apartment
    Frasier stands outside Caitlin's door.  He hesitates for a moment, 
    then sighs and knocks.
    _
    **Caitlin:**[_o.s._] Who is it?
    **Frasier:** Frasier.
    **Caitlin:** Oh my God!  Why didn't you call first?  Oh, I'm working on one 
             of my collages.  I'm covered in paint, I've got turpentine in 
             my hair, I'm all sweaty--
    **Frasier:** It'll only take a moment, I need to talk to you about 
             something.
    **Caitlin:** Oh, all right.  But be nice!
    _She opens the door, looking exactly as she described._
    **Frasier:** Well, actually I... [_chuckles_] Good lord, you really do look... 
             [_whispering_] Good lord!
    _They grab each other and kiss passionately.  Still hanging on to her, 
    he stumbles inside and slams the door.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Frasier's Apartment
    Evening: Daphne opens the door to Roz, who's carrying some files.
    _
        **Roz:** Daphne, is Frasier here?
     **Daphne:** No, he's not back yet.
        **Roz:** He was supposed to meet me at the Cafe over an hour ago to 
             finish this paperwork!  Now he can just do it himself. [_drops 
             it on the table_] Can I use your powder room?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, of course.
    _Roz goes into the powder room.  Niles comes out of the kitchen with 
    a tray of wine glasses._
      **Niles:** Obviously Frasier's attempt to break up with Caitlin has gone 
             awry again.  Thanks to him I have missed the wine tasting.  
             What kind of weak-willed man allows a woman to come between 
             him and a 1981 Cheval Blanc?
     **Daphne:** You know, just out of curiosity, why didn't you go by 
             yourself instead of sit here with me for half an hour?
      **Niles:** I was worried about him, Daphne, worried sick.
    _Daphne nods and turns around.  Niles smells her hair yet again.  
    Frasier comes in the front door._
    **Frasier:** Hello, all.
      **Niles:** Oh...
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, were you at Caitlin's all this time?
    **Frasier:** Heavens, no!  I, uh, I stopped by early this morning.  We've 
             decided to go our separate ways.  And then, I, uh, met up 
             with Roz, went over some paperwork...
    _Roz emerges from the powder room behind him._
    **Frasier:** You know how she is these days.  You know, get her on one of 
             her troubles and yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!
    _Roz closes the door._
    **Frasier:** And yet she makes every story so interesting I could listen 
             to her for hours...
        **Roz:** Knock it off, Frasier.  Where have you been?
    **Frasier:** Oh well, where do you think I've been?  Trying to break up 
             with Caitlin!  But did I do it?  No!  And why?  Because I'm 
             Frasier, and I'm a sex-oholic!
        **Roz:** It's obvious what's happening here.  You are having a purely 
             sexual fling.  It happens to all of us at some time in our 
             lives.  The one where the chemistry is perfect?  Where you 
             can't even be alone together in a room without tearing each 
             other's clothes off and jumping each other -- I mean, does 
             this sound familiar?
    **Frasier/Daphne:** Yes...
      **Niles:**[_a second too late_] Yeah...
     **Daphne:** Everyone's had a relationship like that!  I know I have.  
             His name was... no, I can't tell you!
    _Everyone urges her to spill._
     **Daphne:** It's too embarrassing!
      **Niles:** We're all friends here, we're trying to help Frasier.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well, it was so long ago, I don't even remember all the 
             details.
      **Niles:** Take a minute.
     **Daphne:** Well... it all started one afternoon when I was sunbathing on 
             the roof of our building.  I was concerned about tan lines in 
             those days.  So, I decided to unhook my bikini top-- [_phone 
             rings_] I'll get it.
    _She goes to the phone, not noticing Niles twitch in his seat._
        **Roz:** Gosh, mine was this lifeguard.  He had long blond hair and 
             the bluest eyes.  He used to get so sunburned, I'd spend 
             hours just peeling the skin off his back.  What was his 
             name?  Rick?  Nick!  I know there was an "ick" sound.
    **Frasier:** I was about to make one of those myself.
    _Daphne comes back and hangs up the phone._
     **Daphne:** My mother picks the worst times to call.  Did I miss anything?
      **Niles:** No, nothing.  I believe you were starting to tell us a story?
     **Daphne:** Oh yeah, that's right.  Well, once I got my top off, I started 
             thinking to myself, "You know, I've never had an all-over 
             tan."  So, I looked about to see if I was still alone, then I 
             started to slip off my-- [_oven timer dings_] Oh, the rolls are 
             done.
    _She goes to the kitchen, missing Niles's second, harder twitch._
        **Roz:** We haven't heard anything from you, Niles.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't think we're exactly in Niles's wheelhouse! 
             [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** I beg your pardon?
    **Frasier:** Come on, Niles, I've heard your stories.  They're not the 
             steamiest stuff.
      **Niles:** Obviously you've forgotten the semester I spent living in 
             Paris.  I'll have you know I had a torrid affair with a 
             married woman.
        **Roz:** Really?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry, Niles.  I had no idea.
      **Niles:** It's not something I boast about.  The attraction was simply 
             overpowering.  Every Thursday, two o'clock, the Hotel De 
             Boulogne.  We'd arrive separately, climb the stairs, open 
             the door... _Ooh-la-la_.  Oh, what an embrace!  Afterwards, 
             she'd whisper to me, "There's something so sweet in your eyes, 
             and it"--
    **Frasier:** "Does me so much good," said Emma Bovary!  If you're going 
             to steal a love life, don't steal from the classics, you 
             imbecile!
    _Niles blanches, then slowly turns to look at Roz, who's staring at him._
      **Niles:** The part about being in Paris is true.
    _Daphne comes back with a basket of rolls._
     **Daphne:** Here we are!  Got them out of the oven just in time.  Another 
             minute and I would have had burned buns.
      **Niles:** Which brings us back to your story!
     **Daphne:** Well, there I was wearing nothing but a smile, when the sun 
             started to shift.  So I moved behind the water tower, and who 
             was lying there but Derek -- the good-looking fireman from 
             across the hall?  Who was also getting an all-over tan, I 
             might add!  So, I had two choices.  I could either tiptoe away 
             or-- [_kettle whistles_] Tea.
      **Niles:**[_exploding out of his seat_] No, sit!  My God, must Daphne do 
             _everything_ around here?!
        **Roz:** I'll get it.  I could use a glass of ice water anyway.
    **Frasier:** You're not the only one.  Let me give you a hand.
    _In the kitchen, Roz turns down the stove, then gets a bottle of 
    mineral water from the refrigerator._
        **Roz:** So, is any of this helping?
    **Frasier:** Not much.
        **Roz:** You know, I've got to make a point here.  For as long as 
             I've known you, you've been complaining about your lack of a 
             sex life.  Suddenly, you have one.  So why are you still 
             complaining?
    **Frasier:** Well, it just seems wrong.  I've thought a lot about this--
        **Roz:** Ah, that's your problem.  You've thought too much about 
             this. You know, why don't you just stop listening to your 
             head and start listening to your body?  You're obviously 
             enjoying this.  Why do you have to feel so guilty?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just that I'm afraid I have no future with her.
        **Roz:** So?
    **Frasier:** Well, maybe she thinks that she has a future with me!
        **Roz:** Well, then it would be wrong.  But is that how she feels?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.
        **Roz:** Ask her.  If she feels the same way you do, you should just 
             enjoy yourself.  These things don't come around very often, 
             and they don't last when they do.
    **Frasier:** Well, you're right.  Over-thinking things can certainly spoil 
             anything.  You know, it's funny, I gave the very same advice 
             the other day on my show to that lawyer from Bainbridge.
        **Roz:** I don't remember that.
    **Frasier:** You were five feet away!  Doesn't _anyone_ listen?!
    _Frasier and Roz come back out.  Daphne is just finishing her story._
     **Daphne:** And it wasn't until afterwards that we realized we'd rolled 
             onto the skylight above the main stairwell! [_laughs_] Oh, we 
             took some ribbing about that, we did!
    _Niles is silent.  Very slowly, and with every movement requiring 
    excruciating control, he gets up from the couch, walks to the door, 
    and leaves the apartment without saying a word.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **OF MICE AND WOLFMEN**
    _Scene Five -- Caitlin's Apartment
    Caitlin's modestly furnished loft.  The lights are off, and candles 
    softly illuminate the room.  Frasier sits in an easy chair.  Caitlin 
    comes out of the kitchen and nuzzles him.
    _
    **Caitlin:** Well, I think I got everything under control.  Dinner should 
             be ready in about twenty minutes.
    **Frasier:** Smells wonderful.
    **Caitlin:** So do you.
    **Frasier:** Caitlin, you know...
    **Caitlin:** Yes?
    **Frasier:** Well, I wanted to ask you: where do you see this going?
    **Caitlin:** Well, right now I'm heading to your earlobe, but if you'd care 
             to reroute me, I'm open to suggestions--
    **Frasier:**[_chuckles_] No, I mean our relationship.  We've never talked 
             about it.
    _She stops and sits next to him._
    **Caitlin:** Oh.  Gee, I don't know.  I guess I was kind of looking at this 
             as a nice casual thing.  I hope that doesn't disappoint you?
    **Frasier:** No, not at all, I'm actually relieved!  I-I've been loving 
             things the way they are too.
    **Caitlin:** Yeah, we're just having some fun, right?
    **Frasier:** Right -- oh well, "fun" doesn't begin to describe it!  I just 
             wanted to make sure we were both on the same page.
    **Caitlin:** Is that what's been on your mind?  Because I thought you were 
             tense these last few days.  I even went and got some hot oil 
             to give you a massage.  But I guess we won't be needing that 
             now.
    **Frasier:**[_naughtily_] Well, I have been terribly worried about this 
             global warming situation.
    **Caitlin:** Oh well, we've got time before dinner!  I'll go get the oil!
    _She runs into the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** I'm so glad we had this conversation!
    **Caitlin:**[_o.s._] Yeah, me too!  I mean, I was starting to worry that 
             you were scared off by my lifestyle.  I mean, I'm pretty out 
             there.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Caitlin, Caitlin, I'm not as narrow-minded as all that.  
             You know, I think we have a wonderful chemistry.  That's 
             enough to offset a few minor differences.
    **Caitlin:** You can be taking your shirt off.
    **Frasier:** Oh! [_starts unbuttoning it_] Same goes, by the way!  You know, 
             I just love these converted loft spaces.  I wonder what this 
             one was before you moved in? [_looks up_] Judging by these meat 
             hooks -- a slaughterhouse, huh?
    **Caitlin:** No, I put those in.  It was a day-care center.
    _This fazes Frasier, but he laughs it off._
    **Frasier:** Oh, you artists and your whimsical decorating touches! 
             [_takes off his shirt and sits on the bed_] That's a 
             mousetrap, isn't it?  You get many mice?
    **Caitlin:** I wish!  I use them in my art.
    Fraiser: [_more fazed_] Dead mice?
    **Caitlin:** Yeah, they're part of my newest collage series.  It's all 
             about mortality.
    _Frasier nervously squeezes a pillow.  Caitlin comes out, naked 
    underneath a robe.  Her hair is now cropped short, and she's carrying 
    her shorn tresses in her hands._
    **Frasier:** Caitlin... you've cut your hair!
    **Caitlin:** Yeah, sometimes the spirit just grabs me, and I've got to do 
             it!  It's really very freeing.  Plus I think there's something 
             great about using your body parts for practical use.
    _She sits on the floor and stuffs the hair into a half-full pillowcase._
    **Frasier:** Well, it's uh... it's different!  It's still beautiful, 
             nonetheless.  Is that all your hair?
    **Caitlin:** It's mostly mine.
    _Frasier drops the pillow he's holding._
    **Frasier:** You know, Caitlin, I'm thinking--
    **Caitlin:** No, no, no, don't think! [_turns him around and sits him on 
             the chair_] The secret to a good massage is to let the mind 
             rest, and listen to the body.
    _She digs her fingers into his shoulders, hugging her body to his back._
    **Frasier:** Right.
    **Caitlin:** Yeah...
    **Frasier:** OK.  Go ahead, Body... I'm listening.
    **Caitlin:** Mmm...
    **Frasier:** Oh God, yeah, that feels good.
    **Caitlin:** You know, if we moved to the bed, I could give you a more 
             thorough massage.
    _Frasier stands up and goes to the bed, dropping his trousers to the 
    floor._
    **Caitlin:** Oh, I just remembered, it's a full moon tonight!
    _She goes to the window and throws open the curtains._
    **Caitlin:** Look!  Isn't that beautiful?
    **Frasier:** How romantic.  You know, there's nothing like a full moon to 
             make one--
    _Caitlin throws her head back and lets out a long, spooky howl._
    **Frasier:** Caitlin?
    **Caitlin:** I'm a member of the lycanthrope society.
    **Frasier:** As in... werewolf?
    **Caitlin:** Not literally.  It's a group of women who believe that the 
             moon controls our cycles, and this is our way of paying our 
             respects.
    _She gets on all fours on the bed and lets out another howl._
    **Caitlin:**[_cattily_] Besides, you've heard me howl before.
    **Frasier:** Well, yes, but in that context I took it as a compliment!
    **Caitlin:** Oh, Frasier, you're getting all tense again.  It's the hair 
             pillows, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Yes, that--
    _SNAP!_
    **Caitlin:** Oh, got one!
    **Frasier:** Among other things! 
    _He gets up and starts to pull on his trousers._
    **Frasier:** Listen, Caitlin, I'm starting to think that maybe this isn't 
             such a good idea!
    **Caitlin:** What do you mean?
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, we're just so different!  You know, I'm 
             basically your stuffy, buttoned-down sort of guy!  You're, 
             well, you're your free-spirited, adventurous, mouse-
             painting, moon-howling sort of girl!  Is even the most 
             satisfying sexual relationship enough to bridge that gap?
    **Caitlin:** Well, I think so.
    _She opens her robe and drops the top off her shoulders._
    **Caitlin:** What do you think?
    _Frasier stares... then lets out a wolf howl.  From a ground-level view, 
    we see the rest of their clothes drop to the floor as they fall together 
    onto the bed._
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne steps out of the apartment dressed in a bathrobe, beach sandals, 
    and sunglasses pushed back over her eyes.  She's carrying a lawn chair, 
    a sun hat, and a bag filled with lotions and sunblock.
    
    Niles steps off the elevator at the same moment.  They greet each 
    other.  She drops something from the bag, and he picks it up for her.  
    She steps onto the elevator and he goes into the apartment.
    
    As soon as she's gone, Niles bursts out of the apartment and presses 
    the button to bring the elevator back.  He bounces anxiously on his 
    toes for a second, then turns and makes a mad dash for the stairs.
