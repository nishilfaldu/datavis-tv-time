    _Act 1_
    **IT WAS EITHER
    "THE WHEAT FIELD"
    OR "SANDSTORM"**
    _Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Martin is in the kitchen, getting a trim from Daphne
    while he goes over his mail._
    
     **Martin:** Geez, look at this stuff.  "Golden Sunset Retirement 
             Village," "Investments for Seniors," "Willow Brook 
             Mortuary"?  What the hell kind of list am I on?
     **Daphne:** Well, the good news is I don't think it's the kind of 
             list they keep you on very long.
     **Martin:** Oh, ever since I turned sixty-five, all I get is geezer 
             mail.  It's very depressing.
     **Daphne:** If you ask me, the only thing depressing about being a 
             geezer is looking like one.  There's lots of things a 
             person can do to make himself look younger.  How he 
             dresses...
     **Martin:** Nah, I tried those Jordache jeans.  I just think you 
             oughta leave somethin' to the imagination.
     **Daphne:** Well, there's always your hair.  I know it's not exactly 
             your style, but there's nothing wrong with covering up 
             that gray. [_Martin makes a face._] I know just the right 
             shade for you: cinnamon sable.
     **Martin:**[_thoughtfully_] Cinnamon sable, huh?  Sounds nice.  Oh 
             wait!  I couldn't use that, it's Duke's shade.  He'd 
             scratch my eyes out.
    _The doorbell rings.  CUT TO: the living room as Frasier answers 
    it.  It is Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_holding up a folder_] Frasier, prepare to salivate!
    **Frasier:** Niles, if that is a picture of your new Biedermeier 
             loveseat, you've already shown it to me.
      **Niles:**[_pulling out a photo_] No, this is a photo of my latest 
             purchase: an exquisite, eighteenth-century Turkish 
             prayer rug.  Paid a fortune for it, but legend says 
             whatever you pray for on this rug will come to you.
    **Frasier:** Certainly worked for the dealer.  Oh, I'm sorry Niles, 
             I'm just not in the best of moods.  I just had another 
             disastrous blind date today.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sorry.
    **Frasier:** I mean, murderers on death row can find women to marry 
             them!  I can't find one to sit through coffee!
      **Niles:** It's easy for those men to attract women, they have all 
             that time to work out in the yard.
    **Frasier:** I'm serious.  I'm getting desperate here. 
      **Niles:** Don't obsess about this.  My love life's not much better 
             than yours, but you don't see me going off the deep end.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really.  Did it ever occur to you that this recent 
             antique buying binge you've been on is nothing but a way 
             of sublimating your frustrated sexual desires?
      **Niles:** That's preposterous!  These purchases have nothing to do 
             with sex.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't they?  In addition to the loveseat, let's see, 
             your most recent acquisitions have been: a French bed-
             warmer... a pair of Toby jugs... the less said about 
             that Civil War ramrod, the better.
      **Niles:** Oh, you Freudians!  Sometimes a ramrod is just a... 
             oh hell, even I can't make that one fly.
    
    _Daphne comes in to set the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Take heart, Niles.  We're both in the same boat.  
             The hard part is, where do you go to meet people?
     **Daphne:** Oh, it's not that hard.  Just yesterday I met a very 
             nice man at the grocery.  We got to talking, and he 
             asked me if I was free Saturday night.  I said, "Yes."  
             He said, "Oh, wait, that's my niece's bat mitzvah."  
             I said, "I've never been to a bat mitzvah."  He said, 
             "Would you like to go to the bat mitzvah?"  I said, 
             "Oh, yes.  I'd love to go to the bat mitzvah."  So he 
             said...
    **Frasier:** Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Yes?
    **Frasier:** Oh, nothing, I'm sorry.  Go on.
     **Daphne:** Hmm... Oh, I seem to have lost my train of thought.  
             Oh, well.  Anyone like some tea?  
       **Both:** Oh, love some/Thank you, yes.
    
    _She heads for the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** A little trick I discovered a few weeks ago, it's a 
             lifesaver.  Anyway, as I was saying, where does one 
             go to meet available women?
      **Niles:** There are singles bars, of course.  Uh, we could join a
             health club.
    **Frasier:** Oh, there's a splendid idea.  Yes, I can just picture 
             the two of us: tank tops and spandex.  Find us a pair 
             of matching headbands, we might as well just sterilize 
             ourselves!
     **Martin:**[_coming from the kitchen_] Wow, sounds like fun, Daph.  
             [_muttering_] If she says "bat mitzvah" one more time...  
             Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey Dad. [_to Frasier_] Well, if you're so smart, you come 
             up with an idea.
     **Martin:** What're you guys talkin' about?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just our pathetic love lives.
     **Martin:** Well, you know, why don't you do what my buddies and I 
             used to do when we were young and hard up for dates?
    **Frasier:** Invade Korea? [_Niles bursts out laughing._]
     **Martin:** No, we threw a party.  With just one rule: only single, 
             available people were invited.
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know, Dad.  That doesn't really sound like 
             us.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know, it works.  I used to throw one a 
             month.  People used to call them Marty Parties.  People 
             would call me up and say, "Hey, Marty, when's the next 
             Marty Party?"  "Isn't it about time for another Marty 
             Party?"  "Sure had a great time at that last Marty 
             Party!"
    **Frasier:** Uh, Dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry, nothing.
     **Martin:** Or somebody might say, "Can I host the next Marty 
             Party?"
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] It doesn't always work.
      **Niles:** Yeah.  Thanks Dad, but I don't think we're really quite
             hard-up enough yet to stage a singles party.
     **Martin:** OK, suit yourself.  Well, we'll just get ready for the 
             evening.  I'll dish out the spaghetti and you guys set 
             up the card table. [_tone becomes starker_] I got us a new 
             jigsaw puzzle.  Ten thousand pieces.  It's called "The 
             Wheat Field."
    
    _Frasier and Niles share a look._
    
    **Frasier:** I'll send the invitations.
      **Niles:** I'll call the caterer.
    
    _Fade out._
    **DOES HE OR DOESN'T HE?**
    _Scene 2 - Niles Apartment at the Montana
    Fade in.  The apartment is full of people, all mingling and 
    having a good time.  The doorbell rings, Niles answers it and 
    greets two ladies._
    
      **Niles:** Hello, welcome, please come in.
    **Frasier:** Niles, this is wonderful.  I had no idea we'd get such a 
             turnout.
      **Niles:** I know!  Everywhere I look, there's another woman I want 
             to get to know better. 
    _Roz comes in wearing a black dress and very pregnant._
      **Niles:** With some obvious exceptions. [_He walks off._]
    **Frasier:** Roz, I didn't know you were coming.
        **Roz:** Hey, I know it's a long shot, but I figured I better get 
             out and do a little flirting, before I forget how.
     **Waiter:** Can I offer you something?
    _Roz simply grins like a goof and splutters until the waiter goes 
    away and then buries her face in her hand._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, Roz, you _are_ rusty.
        **Roz:** By the way, I know you've been striking out a lot 
             lately, but I invited someone tonight guaranteed to 
             improve your batting average.
    **Frasier:** Not necessary, Roz.  I've already met someone quite 
             captivating...
    
    _A young woman in a revealing dress comes up to them._
    
       **Tina:** Hi, Roz!
        **Roz:** Tina, you made it.
       **Tina:** Oh, you know me.  Have I ever said 'No' to a good time?
        **Roz:** That's what I was trying to tell Frasier.  Tina Cramer, 
             meet Dr. Frasier Crane. [_They shake._]
    **Frasier:** Hello.
       **Tina:** Doctor, huh? [_Roz walks away._]
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's right.  Roz?  Roz?
       **Tina:** Ooh, strong hands.  I guess it's true what they say:  
             strong hands, strong mind.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, that's why you'll never see an unopened 
             pickle jar at a Mensa meeting.
       **Tina:** Huh?
    
    _We follow Roz as she walks across the room._
    
        **Roz:** Excuse me.  Oh, excuse me.
    _The last man she bumped into turns around.  It is Martin with a 
    horrible dye job._
     
        **Roz:** Martin?
     **Martin:** You're lookin' at my hair, right?
        **Roz:** Well, yeah.  Looks great.
     **Martin:** Thanks.  I did it myself.
        **Roz:** Get out.
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, really.  Well, Daphne suggested it, and at 
             first I said, "No way," but then I thought well, you 
             know, a lot of other guys do it, and what better place 
             to try it than here, where nobody knows who I am?  Boy, 
             you look great, too.
        **Roz:** Oh, thanks.  Yeah, I was really happy with this dress.  
             You can't even tell I'm pregnant in it.
     **Martin:** I know.  I mean, it's just... Well, you have a great 
             time at the party, the dress looks great, nobody'd know.
        **Roz:** Same with your hair, looks completely natural.
     **Martin:** Thanks.
    
    _They separate, each with a look of "Who do they think they're 
    fooling?" on their face.  Martin walks over to Niles._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey watch that "Dad" business.  I've got a few young 
             ladies around here thinking I just might be your 
             brother.
      **Niles:**[_deadpan_] Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.
     **Martin:** What's the matter, aren't you having any fun?
      **Niles:** Oh, sort of.  It's just been so long since I've been 
             single, I'm finding it hard to strike up conversations.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, now, it's nothing.  You just need a little 
             confidence.  Here, watch this.
    
    _He steps over to a young woman._
    
     **Martin:** Hi there.
     **Vickie:** Hi.
     **Martin:** I'm Marty Crane, and this is my son Niles.  Yep, my son.
     **Vickie:** Hi, Vickie Cantrell.  You're the host.
      **Niles:** Yeah.
     **Vickie:** I was just admiring your beautiful Turkish rug.
      **Niles:** Thank you!
     **Vickie:** Is that eighteenth century?
      **Niles:** Yes, it is.  You have quite an eye.
     **Vickie:** Well, I work for an auction house.  I would love to see  
             some of your other pieces.
      **Niles:** Well, It would be my pleasure.  You know there's an 
             absurd old legend about that rug that whatever you pray 
             for... [_As they walk along, Vickie puts her arm in his._] 
             Well, perhaps it's not that absurd after all.
    
    _At another corner of the room, Frasier comes over to Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz!  Roz, that woman is all over me.
        **Roz:** Well, of course she is!  Didn't you get what I was 
             trying to tell ya?
    **Frasier:** Yes of course I got it!  I also got it when she showed 
             me how she can tie a knot in a cherry stem with her 
             tongue.
        **Roz:** That's a party trick.
    **Frasier:** Except the cherry was in my mouth at the time!  Roz, I 
             already tried to tell you that I've met a woman tonight.
        **Roz:** All right.  I'll go talk to her.
    **Frasier:** Thank you. [_Roz walks off, Niles comes up._]
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** I'm so glad we had this party!  I just met the most 
             fabulous woman.
    **Frasier:** Oh that's fabulous.
      **Niles:**[_to bartender_] Two white wines.
    **Frasier:** I also met someone who's terrific.
      **Niles:** Oh, wait, wait.  I can't wait.  I have to show you mine 
             first.  She's over by the buffet.
    **Frasier:** Right, so's mine.
    
    _They both wave to the corner, Vickie waves back._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, let me ask you something:  At what point would 
             you like to acknowledge that we're both waving to the 
             same woman? [_He spins around._] I saw her first!
    **Frasier:** That's not fair!  You're the host, you see everyone 
             first!
      **Niles:** There are plenty of other women here!
    **Frasier:** Exactly, so go pick one!
      **Niles:** Oh, let's just stop this.  The only civilized thing  
             to do is for us to both stay away from her.  We are 
             psychiatrists, not a couple of rutting pigs in a 
             barnyard.  What do you say to that?
    _They look back at Vickie who has just taken off her wrap, 
    revealing bare shoulders and a clinging dress._
    
    **Frasier:** Soo-eee.
      **Niles:** Very well, may the better man win.
        **Roz:** Frasier, your father wants you.
      **Niles:** Ah, advantage Niles! [_He grabs the wine and heads off._]
    _Frasier walks over to Martin, who is sitting with a woman in the 
    chairs by the fire._
    
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** I want you to meet a big fan of yours.  Kathy Lockher, 
             this is my son, Dr. Frasier Crane.
      **Kathy:** I was just telling your father how much I love your 
             show.  You're such a good listener.
    **Frasier:** Uh-huh.
      **Kathy:** Just yesterday, you gave the best advice to that woman 
             who called in with a problem about her teenage son.  
             What was it you said, exactly?
    **Frasier:**[_watching Niles and Vickie_] Oh, what do I ever say?  
             You're in denial, seek help, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  
             [_He walks away._]
      **Kathy:** He's a little different from what I expected.
     **Martin:** Yeah, he's not what I expected either, but you get used 
             to it.
      **Kathy:** So, you were telling me about being a detective.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, yeah, I... say, do you ah, feel like getting a 
             drink?
      **Kathy:** Yeah, that'd be nice, Marty.
     **Martin:** OK, let's go.
    _He starts to get up but notices that his hair has left a large 
    stain on the back of the chair.  He hurriedly sits back down._
    
     **Martin:** You know, this is such a prime spot here, I think one of 
             us should stay here and one of us should get the drinks.
      **Kathy:** You're right.
     **Martin:** So, I'll have a beer.
      **Kathy:**[_unsure_] OK. [_She gets up._] Oh, shoot, I think I lost an 
             earring.
     **Martin:** Oh, oh, there it is, by my foot. [_Kathy looks expectantly
             at him.  He flicks the earring to her with his foot._] 
             There you go.
      **Kathy:** Thanks.  Enjoy the party.
    
    _CUT TO: Niles and Vickie coming from the buffet._
    
      **Kathy:** These eggrolls are delicious.
      **Niles:** I, uh, made them myself.
      **Kathy:** Really, a psychiatrist and a chef?  Impressive.
      **Niles:** Yes, well they both came in handy when I cured the ham.
    
    _They laugh, Frasier comes up._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello Niles.
      **Niles:** What do you want?
    **Frasier:** Actually, there's something of an emergency in the 
             kitchen.
      **Niles:** Oh, that's very cadgy, Frasier.  Why don't you just run 
             out and yell "Fire?"
    _Frasier motions towards the kitchen.  The door is open, smoke is 
    coming out, and a caterer is waving Niles over while mouthing the 
    word "Fire."_
    
      **Niles:** Dear God.  Excuse me, Vickie, for just for a moment.
     **Vickie:** Of course.
    _Niles runs to the kitchen, holding his hands down and moving 
    stiffly._
     **Vickie:** Is it a serious problem?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no.  He's always run like that.  Oh, oh you mean the 
             kitchen.  No, no, Niles can handle it.
     **Vickie:** You two seem very close.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  I'm his best friend.  Well, his only friend 
             really.
     **Vickie:** Well that surprises me.  He seems very outgoing. 
    **Frasier:** Doesn't he, though?  Yes, the medication seems to be 
             working wonders.  Just hope he sticks with it this time.  
             Well, shall we hit the buffet?
    _CUT TO: Roz sitting at one end of the fainting couch and talking 
    to a young man._
    
        **Roz:** What a great story.
        **Man:** Thanks, this is fun.
        **Roz:** Yeah.
        **Man:** I usually hate these kinds of parties.
        **Roz:** Oh, me too. People are always so superficial.
        **Man:** Yeah, seems like everybody nowadays is all about   
             appearances.  Well, shall we get a drink?
        **Roz:** Yeah, sure.
    _Roz stands up and the man steps down from the landing.  He is a 
    head shorter than her and stares at her stomach.  They freeze._
        **Roz:** I'm not really very thirsty.
        **Man:** Me either.
        **Roz:** OK.
        **Man:** See ya.
    _They walk off.  Cut to Frasier talking with Vickie by the door._
    **Frasier:** Then I top it all off with brandied cherries and a 
             dollop of creme fraiche.
      **Niles:** Excuse me, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Not now Niles.  I'm telling Vickie my recipe for crepes 
             cateau.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sure she's had enough of your crepes by now.  
             I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, but I believe Dad needs 
             you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** No, he doesn't.
     **Vickie:** Oh, I think he might. [_Martin is frantically waving at 
             Frasier._]
    **Frasier:** All right, then.  If you will excuse me.
     **Vickie:** Do you live with your father, Niles?
      **Niles:**[_laughing_] Oh, no.  A grown man, live with his father?  
             Frasier lives with Dad.  Champagne?
     **Vickie:** Oh, yes.
    _CUT TO: Frasier talking to Martin again.  Martin has something 
    dripping down his forehead._
    
    **Frasier:** What is it?
     **Martin:** You gotta get me home!
    **Frasier:** Why?
     **Martin:** Well, something's happening with my hair dye.  It's 
             melting or somethin'.  Look at this stain! [_indicating 
             chair, not his head_] It must look terrible.
    **Frasier:** No, no it doesn't actually.  It looks terrific. 
     **Martin:** You sure?
    **Frasier:** Well, maybe the fire is making you perspire just a 
             little bit.  Here.
    
    _He wipes at Martin's forehead, smearing it._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, actually you look quite young and attractive.  You 
             know by the warmth of the fire glow, I'd say that you 
             actually look like you're back in your Marty Party days.
     **Martin:** You're not BSing me?
    **Frasier:** No, no.
     **Martin:** OK, then, I'll stay.
    **Frasier:** Great!
    
    _He walks over to Vickie._
    
    **Frasier:** Vickie.  Hello, where's Niles?
     **Vickie:** Oh, he had to take a call.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, that's terrific.  Ah, would you be interested 
             in maybe finding some place where we could talk, just 
             the two of us, no interruptions?
     
    _Roz comes over, grabs his arm and pulls him away._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Not now, Roz. 
        **Roz:** Come here.
    **Frasier:** Can't you see I'm busy?
        **Roz:** My water just broke!
    **Frasier:** Well... maybe you sat in something.
    
    _Roz stares at him.  Then Niles ices it._
    
      **Niles:**[_hollering from a corner_] Oh my God, what's all over my 
             Turkish prayer rug?!
        **Roz:** You gotta get me to a hospital.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I'm sorry, of course.  Vickie, Vickie?  If 
             you'll excuse us, my friend Roz just went into labor.
     **Vickie:** Oh, how exciting!  Good luck.
        **Roz:** Thanks.
    **Frasier:** Oh, wait, wait just one second.  Vickie, I know this may 
             not be the most appropriate moment, but I was wondering 
             if perhaps you'd like to have dinner with me sometime.
     **Vickie:** Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, Frasier, but I'm not 
             really interested.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, thank you for your honesty. [_to Roz_] My God!  
             What is wrong with me?  Why can't I find a single woman 
             who's interested in me?
        **Roz:** Those are two different questions, really, so we should 
             just sit down and talk them both over.  Oh, wait, I 
             can't - BECAUSE I'M IN LABOR!!
    
    _They rush out the door.  FADE OUT.
    
    End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - The Hospital
    Fade in.  Frasier and Martin are at the vending machines in the 
    waiting area._
    
    **Frasier:** How's the coffee, Dad?
     **Martin:** Better.  This time it's hot and it's got extra cream.  
             Of course, it's still chicken soup.
    _He throws the cup away.  They go over to the chairs and Martin 
    sits._
    **Frasier:** Well, who needs coffee when we can keep alert by 
             perusing these very up-to-date magazines? [_picks 
             one up_] Oh, look, Dad.  That cute Tricia Nixon's 
             getting married.
    
    _A nurse walks by._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, excuse me?  May we get an update on Roz Doyle?
      **Nurse:** Sure. [_checks her clipboard_] Uh, she is still in early 
             labor.  Hang in there.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
     **Martin:** She's pretty.  I should make a play for her -- considering 
             how young and attractive I am tonight!
    **Frasier:** I said I was sorry!  Not half as sorry as I was when I 
             went over that speed bump and you left a head print on 
             the ceiling of my BMW.
    
    _He sits down, Niles comes around the corner._
    
      **Niles:** Ah, hello.
     **Martin:** Hi.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.  Didn't expect to see you here.
      **Niles:** Oh, well, the doorman found Roz's purse in the lobby.  
             I thought she might need it.
    **Frasier:** I suppose you also came to gloat.  You got Vickie, I 
             didn't.
      **Niles:**[_sitting down between them_] Neither of us got Vickie.  
             She went home with the bartender.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, you know what I say?  Her loss.
      **Niles:** Absolutely right.  Her loss! [_pause_] Has saying that  
             ever made you feel any better?
    **Frasier:** Not a whit.
     **Martin:** It's been a hell of a night for all of us.
      **Niles:** Well, it certainly was for me.  I lost Vickie, my rug 
             is ruined, someone left weird brown stains on my wing 
             chair...
    _Martin sinks lower in his chair.  Daphne comes around the corner._
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    
    _Niles and Frasier rise, they all greet her._
    
     **Daphne:** Yes, I came down as soon as I heard. [_She notices 
             Martin._] What the hell happened to your hair?
     **Martin:** Well, what do you think?  I colored it, just like you 
             told me to.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, but this isn't cinnamon sable.
     **Martin:** Well, I couldn't use that, it had a woman's picture on 
             the box.  So I used some stuff called "Color In A Can" 
             instead.  It said "As seen on TV - Just spray on and 
             go."  How did I know it was a lousy product?
    **Frasier:** If only there had been some clue!
     **Martin:** Don't you start on me, mister, you left me melting by 
             that fire.
      **Niles:** Wait a minute!  You're the one who left stains on my 
             wing chair!
    **Frasier:** I was wondering when you'd crack that, Miss Marple!
    
    _The men begin yelling back and forth._
    
     **Daphne:** Stop it!  What is wrong with the three of you?!  Our 
             friend is having a baby in there!
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, Daphne, we've all had dreadful evenings, but 
             you're absolutely right.  We should be thinking of Roz.  
             [_They all sit._]
     **Daphne:** Exactly.  Besides, nobody could've had as horrendous an 
             evening as I did.  I got stood up.  At a bat mitzvah!  
             I waited there an hour.  Oh, he left some lame excuse on 
             the machine, but if he thinks he's got another chance 
             with me, he's _meshugge_.  
    
    _Martin and Niles turn to Frasier with confused looks._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, boo-hoo, anyway.  At least you had a date tonight!
      **Niles:** Oh, at least your apartment wasn't decimated!
     **Martin:** I went to a party tonight with shoe polish on my hair!
    
    _Four-way bickering ensues.  Then Roz is pushed in a bed around 
    the corner, breathing heavily._
    
      **Nurse:** That's it, breathe.  You're doing great.
    _The four friends stop and begin calling words of encouragement to 
    Roz. "You're doing great!"  "Hang in there!"  "We love you."  As 
    soon as the bed is pushed into a room, they begin fighting again.  
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 2 - Roz's Room
    Fade in.  The nurse comes in and holds the door for the others._
    
      **Nurse:** She's very tired, so I'll have to ask you to make it 
             quick.
    **Frasier:** OK.  
    _The four of them enter.  Roz is sitting up in bed, exhausted 
    and drenched in sweat - but radiant.  Sleeping in her arms is 
    a beautiful baby girl.
    
    Everyone whispering:_
    
    **Frasier:** Roz.  Congratulations.
     **Martin:** Oh, look at her!
      **Niles:** Oh, she's beautiful.
     **Daphne:**_Mazel tov_!
    
    _Roz looks questioningly at Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** It's a long story.
     **Daphne:** So, what's her name?
        **Roz:** Alice.  Alice May Doyle.  My daughter.  My God, it's the 
             first time I've ever said that.
     **Martin:** Well, you look great.  How do you feel?
        **Roz:** Oh, fine.  Just a little tired.
     **Martin:** Sure.
     **Daphne:** Maybe we should go.
    **Frasier:** Right.
     **Daphne:** I'll drop by and see you tomorrow, OK?
        **Roz:** OK.
     **Martin:**[_reaching out_] You know, I sure would love to hold her 
             for just a second?
    **Frasier:**[_intercepting and taking Alice_] You know, maybe we 
             should just wait until you're not dripping toxins.
     **Martin:** Oh.  OK, we'll see you, then.
      **Niles:** Congratulations.
    **Frasier:** I'll be along in a second.
    
    _Martin, Niles and Daphne leave._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz.  Congratulations again.  I'm so proud of you.  
             Your little girl is just perfect.
        **Roz:**[_strokes Alice's head_] She is, isn't she?
    **Frasier:** Mm-hmm.  My God, look at your face.
        **Roz:** Oh, yeah, I must look real lovely.
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's exactly how you look: lovely.  I don't think 
             I've ever seen your face more purely happy than right now.  
    
    _He lays Alice into a bassinet by the bedside._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, little Alice, how I wish you could wake up right now 
             and see how beautiful your mother looks. [_Roz is now 
             dead asleep, head thrown back and snoring._] Then again, 
             you need your rest.
    _He puts the baby in her little bed.  The nurse comes in behind 
    him._
    **Frasier:**[_sotto voce_] You did great, honey. [_He kisses her on the 
             forehead_] Sleep well. [_He turns and notices the nurse._] 
             Oh, hello.
      **Nurse:** Hi.
    **Frasier:** This may seem like an odd time to ask you this, but I 
             was convinced that we sort of made some eye contact in 
             the waiting room and I was wondering if I could get your 
             number.
      **Nurse:**[_thinking Roz is his wife_] What about your...?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, forget about her, she's asleep.
      **Nurse:** What kind of monster are you?! [_She leaves in a huff._]
    **Frasier:** Her loss.
    
    _FADE OUT.
    
    End of Act 2_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles is escorting a cleaning woman around his apartment.  He 
    points to the stain on the wing chair and she nods.  Then he 
    turns around a lampshade and exposes another stain, leads her to 
    the door where there is a third, then lifts a pillow to show her 
    a stain on the arm of the fainting couch.  He then turns the 
    throw pillow over to temporarily cover the stain, only to find 
    one on the pillow.  He just walks away, depressed.
