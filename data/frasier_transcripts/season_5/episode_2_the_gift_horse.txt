    [_Act One_]
    
    [_Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier is standing in the cafe when Roz enters._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, good morning, Roz.
        **Roz:** Good morning.
    
    [_Roz starts to kiss Frasier passionately.  He struggles free after a 
    while._]
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell was that?
        **Roz:**[_looks around_] Oh, shoot!  He's not even here!
    **Frasier:**[_wiping off kiss_] Who?
        **Roz:** Do you remember that guy who dumped me last month?  I thought 
             he was right behind me.  I just wanted him to see me with 
             another guy so he'd know how completely over him I am!
    **Frasier:** Good idea, Roz.  If that doesn't work, why don't we get 
             married and have some children, that will really fix his 
             wagon!
        **Roz:** You might remember him, Stan?
    **Frasier:**[_thinks_] Stan?  The smug stockbroker who kept calling me 
             "Frazer?"
        **Roz:** Oh yeah, that's the one.  One minute, we're hot an' 
             heavy and then he stops calling.  It's so humiliating when 
             someone treats you like you don't even exist.
    **Frasier:**[_not listening to her_] How can someone not hear the 
             difference between "Frasier" and "Frazer"?
        **Roz:** Yeah, that's what bugged me the most too! [_to waiter_] I'll 
             have an espresso to go, please.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, Roz, I almost forgot, here's the invitation to my 
             dad's birthday party.  Sherry's giving it, so please excuse 
             the elegant verse, but...
    
    [_Frasier hands it over._]
    
        **Roz:**[_reads_] "Come one, Come all, To jump and jive, Marty Crane's 
             turning sex-ty-five!" 
    
    [_She notices Stan enter the Caf e._] 
    
        **Roz:** Oh my God, here he is.  Please?
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right.
    
    [_Frasier and Roz start kissing passionately which turns Stan away.  
    They keep on kissing, not noticing Niles enter the Cafe._] 
    
      **Niles:** Hello.
    
    [_Startled, Frasier breaks away from Roz, who continues the charade
    by keeping her arms around him and nuzzling his neck._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.  You know, this isn't what it looks like.  You 
             see, her ex-boyfriend was just... [_off her nuzzling_] Oh, just 
             stop that!
      **Niles:** Please, no explanation necessary.  I assume that at the next 
             meeting of Seattle's "Haven't Kissed Roz Club," it will just 
             be me and the archbishop!
        **Roz:** I'll save you the club fees.
      **Niles:** What-?
    
    [_Roz kisses Niles and exits, leaving him somewhat philosophical._]
    
    **Niles:** Everyone kisses better than Maris!
    
    [_Frasier and Niles move to a table._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_to waiter_] Can I get one of the same for Dr. Crane, please? 
             [sits with Niles]
      **Niles:** I'm sorry I'm late, I was shopping for Dad's present.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's all right, Niles.  I did a bit of that myself this 
             morning.  I found a lovely little calfskin wallet with a 
             matching key case.
      **Niles:** Oh.  Well, bravo, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and it was a full twenty dollars below our agreed-upon 
             spending limit.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm so glad we agreed to rein ourselves in this year.
    **Frasier:** Oh God, me too.  Finally to do away with our annual contest 
             to see who could give dad the most lavish gift.
      **Niles:** I think the competition had gotten a bit... er, what is the 
             best word for it?
    **Frasier:** Extreme.
      **Niles:** No, childish.
    **Frasier:** Gaudy.
      **Niles:** Crass.
    **Frasier:** Obscene.
      **Niles:** Baroque.
    **Frasier:** Stop it!  So, what did you get him?
      **Niles:** Oh, just some... beer.
    **Frasier:** Well, we're not exactly bumping our heads on that spending 
             ceiling, are we?
      **Niles:**[_laughs_] It's a bit fancier than that.  It's a membership in 
             a beer club.  They deliver a case from a different micro 
             brewery every month.
    **Frasier:** You know, I looked into those clubs, they're rather 
             expensive.
      **Niles:** Oh, not really.  I'm right at our limit.  Maybe with taxes 
             and handling I'm a drop or two over.
    **Frasier:** How big a drop?
      **Niles:** Just, er... a hundred dollars over.
    **Frasier:** That's not a drop, it's a downpour!
      **Niles:** It's a dribble.
    **Frasier:** It's a deluge!
      **Niles:** It's a...
    **Frasier:** Stop it!
      **Niles:** Oh, why don't you just stick a hundred dollars in that 
             wallet of yours and we'll call it even.
    **Frasier:** Well, frankly, I don't need to buy dad's love.  You've opted 
             to violate our agreement, so be it.  I have a gift, you have 
             a gift.
      **Niles:** Fine.
    **Frasier:** Big baby!
    
    [_Frasier and Niles look away from each other._]
    
    [_Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier is seated reading the newspaper as Eddie stares up at him._]
    
    **Frasier:** Stare all you like.  You will not distract me from my paper. 
             You see, your efforts are futile, I can't even see you.
    
    [_Frasier holds the paper up in front of him.  Eddie, however, just 
    keeps jumping into view over the paper.  Frasier, in agitation, folds 
    the paper up and exits with Eddie to the kitchen.  Daphne and Niles 
    then enter carrying shopping bags._]
    
     **Niles:** It seems so unhealthy.  Is she going to serve anything at 
            Dad's party but meat?
    **Daphne:** Sherry says that's what he and his old cronies like best.
            With drinks, she's serving cocktail franks.  For appetisers, 
            we're having a sausage medley.  And for the main course 
            there's a choice of meat loaf or meat balls.
     **Niles:** I assume these colourful balloons are for the between course 
            angioplasty!
    
    [_Sherry enters and notices them as Frasier re-enters._]
    
     **Sherry:** Did you get everything, Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes, I think so.
     **Sherry:** Good news, I found a guy who can sculpt an exact replica of 
             Marty's old police badge out of six pounds of liverwurst.
    **Frasier:** Oh, how reminiscent of the cream cheese gavel they gave 
             Thurgood Marshall on his eightieth!
    
    [_Martin enters holding a photo as Daphne exits to her room._]
    
    **Martin:** Oh, we can't use this photograph, it's too embarrassing.
    **Sherry:**[_laughs_] That's exactly why we're using it.  I'm decorating 
            the whole party with old pictures of Marty from the force.
    **Martin:** Well, we can't use this one of me at the morgue; it's too 
            disturbing.
    
    [_Niles takes a look._]
    
      **Niles:** You're right, I totally forgot you even had a perm!
     **Martin:** Oh, God, I can't wait to see this guy again.  Mickey Doogan. 
             We rode mounted patrol together.
     **Sherry:** Oh, look at you.  You look so big and handsome on your horse. 
             [_looks at another_] Oh my God, when was this taken?
     **Martin:** April Fools' Day.
    **Frasier:**[_looks_] Oh, yes, yes, that would explain why your horses are 
             wearing brassieres.
     **Martin:** Oh God, I loved that horse.  Old Agides and I were together 
             for eight years.  Best partner I ever had.
     **Sherry:** Oh, we should get going.
     **Martin:** Okay.
     **Sherry:** Marty, where ever did you find a bra that could fit a horse?
     **Martin:** Oh, Mickey brought it in from home.  Mae Doogan was a lot of 
             things, but petite she wasn't!  I'll point her out to you at 
             the party.
     **Sherry:** Honey, if that's her bra, I can spot her myself.
    
    [_Martin and Sherry exit._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well, er, sherry, Niles?
      **Niles:** Oooh... [_looks at watch_] ...no, thanks, I've got a session.
    **Frasier:** Ah. [_pours himself one_]
    
    [_Daphne enters with a box and wrapping paper_]
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, is your father gone?
    **Frasier:** Yes, he has.
     **Daphne:** Good, then I'll wrap his present.  They fit fine in this box.
    **Frasier:** Great, Daphne, off you go.
      **Niles:** Wait a minute.  That box is awfully big for what you got him.
     **Daphne:** No, it isn't.
    **Frasier:** Ah, Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Your binoculars fit just perfectly in here!
      **Niles:** You told me you got him a wallet and a key case!
     **Daphne:** Oh, no, not this again!  It's the same nonsense every year.
    **Frasier:** Well, not this year.  We'd actually agreed to a spending 
             limit until someone else exceeded it.
      **Niles:** All right, all right.  Guilty as charged.  We've each violated 
             the pact once.  Now let's stop before this madness gets out 
             of hand.
    **Frasier:** Well, if you ask me, your gifts compliment each other 
             perfectly.
      **Niles:** Em, Daphne... [_puts a finger to his lips_]
     **Daphne:** Your binoculars and your football tickets.
    **Frasier:** Tickets?
     **Daphne:**[_"Uh-oh..."_] Season tickets to the Seahawks.
    **Frasier:** I don't believe you!  You already had a better gift than 
             mine, you still saw the need to take it to a higher level.
      **Niles:** Only because I knew you were going to upgrade that wallet, 
             which you did!
    **Frasier:** All right, enough is enough.  I quit, I'm throwing in the 
             towel.
      **Niles:** Oh, and why should I believe you?
    **Frasier:** Because this is a receipt for the binoculars, this should 
             prove to you that I have no intention of returning them in 
             order to get a better gift. [_tears it up_] There.
      **Niles:** Well, that's very big of you.  I'm late for my session.  If 
             it's any consolation, I'm not really sure how good those 
             tickets are.  I was hoping to get something on the first two 
             yard lines but I could only get ones way back on the 
             fiftieth!
    
    [_Niles shrugs innocently and exits._]
    
    [_N.B. Being on the fiftieth yard line means you are seated right next 
    to the center of the field, at the bottom of the stands next to the 
    green - the best seats in the stadium.  However, Niles is no doubt 
    ignorant of this, so his innocence must be genuine._]
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm very proud of you, Dr. Crane.  I...
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop babbling, Daphne, and bring me some tape!
    
    [_Daphne rolls her eyes._]
    
    **COME AGAIN WHEN YOU
    CAN'T STAY SO LONG**
    
    [_Scene Three - Caf e Nervosa.
    Sherry and Daphne are sat running through Martin's upcoming party._]
    
    **Daphne:** Okay, the keg of beer will be there by six.  I also confirmed 
            the band, ordered the cake, filled out the place cards, 
            picked up the humourous cocktail napkins and I'm almost done 
            making the centerpieces.
    **Sherry:**[_sighs_] Oh, this party is just going to wear me out!
    
    [_Niles enters._]
    
     **Niles:** Hello, Daphne, Sherry. [_to waitress_] Double Latte, please. 
            [_sits_] Is Frasier with you?
    **Sherry:** No, he's out shopping for your dad.
     **Niles:** That jackal!
    
    [_Niles jumps to his feet and dashes out of the Caf e._]
    
    **Sherry:** What was that all about?
    **Daphne:** Brother snit.  Don't ask.
    **Sherry:** I forgot to tell you.  I found this fabulous photograph of 
            Marty arresting some guy.  I had it blown up to life size, 
            then I cut out the crook's face so people could stick their 
            heads through and have a snap shot of Marty reading them 
            their rights.  Don't you just love it?
    **Daphne:** It depends.  Do I have to pick it up?
    **Sherry:** By five, you're a doll!
    
    [_Frasier enters with a shopping bag and greets them._]
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, did you find something?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I did.  It took me most of the afternoon but I finally 
             came up with something I think is just about perfect!
    
    [_The waitress brings Niles's coffee as Frasier sits._]
    
     **Sherry:** Oh, Niles forgot his coffee.
    **Frasier:** Niles was here?
     **Sherry:** Yes, but you know, when I mentioned that you were out 
             shopping for your dad he just shot out of here like a 
             bullet!
    **Frasier:** That little worm!
    
    [_Frasier grabs his shopping bag and exits._]
    
    [_Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    Daphne is seated on the couch reading, her feet on the table.  
    Frasier enters as she quickly lowers them.  His jacket is slung
    over his shoulder and he looks exhausted._]
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, are you all right?
    **Frasier:** No, I am not.  I've combed the entire city trying to find a 
             gift - but nothing is better than what Niles got him.
     **Daphne:** What did your brother get him?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.  I'm sure it's something any father would just 
             love.
    
    [_Martin enters from his room._]
    
     **Martin:** Why, you know the best thing about turning sixty-five? 
             Everybody wants to buy you dinner! [_laughs_]
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, you've left your top button unbuttoned.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, that's because Duke's taking me to Hoppy's Old 
             Heidelberg.  You know, if I don't unbutton it now, it might 
             fly off and hurt somebody!
    **Frasier:** Enjoy, Dad.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, I will.  I gotta tell 'ya, I'm loving this 
             birthday.  All of a sudden my money's no good.  Last night, 
             Ed Flannagan bought the whole bar a round in my honour.
    **Frasier:** Who's Ed Flannagan?
     **Martin:** That's what I asked!  Anyway, what are you doing tonight, 
             Fras'?
    **Frasier:** Er, nothing much.  I've got some shopping to do.
     **Martin:** Oh, for anybody we know? [_laughs_] You know, Fras', every 
             year, you and Niles, you go overboard trying to find these 
             great presents for me and I've got to be honest, it's always 
             made me kind of uncomfortable.
    **Frasier:**[_relieved_] Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  So this year, I just wanted you to know... I'm over 
             it!  So, go crazy, you only turn sixty-five once!
    
    [_Martin exits.  Frasier stands up, puts his head in his arms and 
    collapses onto his father's chair._]
    
     **Daphne:** You know, Dr. Crane,  the last thing I want to do is 
             encourage more competition between you and your brother. 
             [_goes to him_] But if you really want to make your father
             happy, maybe the time has come...
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't even say it!
     **Daphne:** But it's the only thing he's ever asked for!
    **Frasier:** No!  God, it'll ruin my apartment, my life!  I can't, I won't,  
             I mustn't!
     **Daphne:** It's over, Dr. Crane.
    
    [_Frasier cries into her arms._]
    
    [_Scene Five - Frasier's Apartment.
    We see the back of a huge monstrosity of some kind.  The camera raises 
    to its peak (which is basically at the roof of the apartment) and 
    shows Frasier and Daphne sitting on Martin's chair, looking up, 
    awestruck, at the mother of all-_]
    
     **Daphne:** That is one big-screen TV.  He's going to love it!
    **Frasier:**[_in tears_] I know!
    
    [_Daphne nurses Frasier._]
    
    [_End of Act One_]
    
    [_Act Two_]
    
    [_Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    We resume the scene. Daphne is cleaning the big-screen television as 
    Frasier looks on._]
    
    **Frasier:** Perhaps I'm panicking needlessly.  It just needs a little 
             dressing-up, really.  You know, I'll just arrange these 
             plants here at the base. [_he does_]
     **Daphne:** Yes, you always said you needed more greenery in here.
    **Frasier:** Yes, maybe an _objet_ or two on top.  Yes, yes, this little 
             bud vase, here.
    
    [_Frasier puts a rose vase on the top and admires it, giving a little 
    Bette Davis shrug._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_denial_] That makes a world of difference, doesn't it?
     **Daphne:**[_acting_] Oh, sure it does, Dr. Crane.  All the difference in 
             the world!
    **Frasier:**[_falling to bits_] Oh, it's ghastly! [_doorbell sounds_] Oh 
             God, you just don't put a smear of lipstick on the Bride of 
             Frankenstein and turn her into a trophy wife, do you?!
    
    [_Frasier opens the door to Niles._]
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, are you ready? We told dad we'd pick him up at... 
    
    [_Niles notices the eyesore.  He is speechless as Frasier watches him 
    in some sort of jealous pride._]
    
      **Niles:** Oh my God, you didn't?!
    **Frasier:** Didn't what?  You mean buy dad this television set?  Of course I 
             did!  Ah, it's impressive, isn't it?
      **Niles:** I knew how jealous you were, but to go to such insane lengths 
             to top me... Frasier, you have lain waste to your apartment 
             with this eyesore!
    **Frasier:** I disagree!  Where you see an eyesore, I see a picture 
             window to a world of art and culture.  Just think how a 
             screen this size will enhance the majesty of the 
             Metropolitan Opera.  Or the thrilling artists of the Bolshoi!
      **Niles:** You're quite a Bolshoi artist yourself!
    **Frasier:** Oh, you're right, it's dreadful, isn't it!  But you know, 
             it's worth it, just to imagine the smile it'll put on dad's 
             face, not to mention the pleasure of watching you twist and 
             writhe in envy. [_pause_] You're not twisting and writhing!
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, my mind wandered.  I was remembering Dad waxing 
             nostalgic the other day about his beloved old horse, Agides.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't try to change the subject, Niles, you've lost, 
             admit it!
      **Niles:** He certainly did love that horse.
    **Frasier:** You can only live in denial for so long before you...
    
    [_Frasier gasps in sudden realisation._]
    
    **Frasier:** You didn't?!
      **Niles:** Didn't what?  Buy the horse?  Sorry, did!
    **Frasier:** Oh! ... Oh... how could you?!
      **Niles:** I've already set him up in a handsome stable.  Dad can visit 
             him anytime he wants, which reminds me, I'd like to swing by 
             the stable on the way to the party so dad can- [_laughs_] look 
             his gift horse in the mouth!
    **Frasier:** Ah, all right, Niles.  What else can I do?  I give up!  You 
             win.  You have found the one gift that can't be trumped.
    
    [_The doorbell sounds as Daphne goes to get it._]
    
      **Niles:** Thank you, Frasier.  You're a gracious loser.
    **Frasier:** Still, on the bright side, I know dad will love this set.  
             He really will.  And already it doesn't seem quite as 
             intrusive as it did when it first got here.
    
    [_Daphne opens the door to some workers wielding enormous dynamo 
    speakers._]
    
     **Daphne:** Right this way.
    **Frasier:**[_in horror_] What are those?
     **Daphne:** Your speakers.
    
    [_Frasier buries his head.  Niles comforts him._]
    
    **SURE, BUT CAN HE 
    DO LONG DIVISION?**
    
    [_Scene Two - Horse Stables.
    Frasier and Niles lead a blindfolded Martin into the stables._]
    
     **Niles:** So, dad, any idea where you are?
    **Martin:** Oh, it's so mysterious.  Hay under foot, stable smells, that 
            saddle we just tripped over... I mean, we could be anywhere!
     **Niles:** All right, all right.
    
    [_Niles takes his blindfold off._]
    
    **Martin:** What?
     **Niles:**_Voila!_ [_motioning to horse_] Happy birthday.
    
    [_Martin is shown to a horse in a pen.  "AGIDES" entitles it.  Martin 
    and Niles react as Frasier stays at the back of the stable in jealous 
    anger._]
    
    **Martin:** Agides!  Hey, buddy, how are you doing?  Oh, long-time-no-see. 
            [_to Niles_] What's going on?
     **Niles:** He's yours, dad.
    **Martin:** What?
     **Niles:** I bought him for you.
    **Martin:** You're kidding me, I can't believe it!
     **Niles:** You can visit him anytime you want.
    **Martin:** This is amazing. [_to Agides_] How've you been, buddy, huh? 
            Hey, one plus one equals?
    
    [_Agides kicks the stable door twice._]
    
     **Martin:** He remembers!
      **Niles:** I figured it was a long shot when I called but they were a 
             week away from putting him out to pasture, so I set him up 
             here at Brier Wood, it's the most exclusive stable in town. 
             Don't be surprised if you spy a certain resident trotting by 
             wearing his triple crown.
    **Frasier:** They don't give them actual crowns, you twit! [_pause_] Well, 
             come on, Dad, you don't want to be late for the party, I'm 
             sure Sherry's getting warm in that cake!
    
    [_Martin seems entranced by the horse._]
    
    **Frasier:** Dad?
     **Martin:** Huh?
    **Frasier:** Don't want to be late.
      **Niles:** Are you all right, dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I'm fine.
    **Frasier:** Are you sure?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I said I was fine.  Now, come on, let's go to my party.
    
    [_They start to exit._]
    
    **Frasier:** Is there something you'd like to talk about?
     **Martin:** Oh, now, come on, guys.  You don't have to pull everything 
             apart.  I said I'm fine, all right?  Let's go.
    
    [_Martin exits._]
    
    **Niles:** All that effort, all that expense... How many minutes of joy 
           did it buy?
    
    [_Frasier raises his foot, horse-style, and stamps the ground once, twice,
    three times.  They exit._]
    
    [_Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    The lights are off as the brothers enter later that night.  As they 
    switch on the lights, the television and speakers are revealed.  The 
    speakers are arranged, circumferencing Martin's chair._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh dear God!  It's Stonehenge!
      **Niles:** Well, I hope it'll at least cheer dad up.  The party 
             certainly didn't.
    **Frasier:** God, I know.  Not even when Sherry sang that little ditty 
             she'd composed; "You Can Cop A Feel If I Can Feel A Cop"! 
             Brandy, Niles?
      **Niles:** Please.
    
    [_Frasier pours._]
    
      **Niles:** I tried to draw Dad out of the party, he just shot me right 
             down.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know how he is.  Gets himself into these moods, he 
             just retreats.
      **Niles:** It's just so damn frustrating.  How many wonders if that 
             isn't why we go so insane every year, trying to find the
             perfect gift, as if somehow finding the right present will 
             magically change everything.
    **Frasier:** The thought occurred to me too.
      **Niles:** You didn't mention it.
    **Frasier:** It occurred to me.
      **Niles:** So you say.
    **Frasier:** Well, it... stop it!
    
    [_Sherry enters._]
    
     **Sherry:** Hiya, boys. [_notices television and gasps_] Wow!  She's a 
             beaut!  Oh, Marty and I are going to be spending a lot more 
             time over here! [_hangs up coat_]
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] It's the gift that keeps on giving!
     **Sherry:** Well, where's your dad?
    **Frasier:** He said he was coming home with you.
     **Sherry:** Well, he told me that he was coming home with you.
      **Niles:** Why would he do that?
     **Sherry:** He was a little down at the party.  Maybe he just wanted to 
             go for a walk.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure he's all right.  He'll be back soon.
      **Niles:** Still, it is rather late.  I'll just go and look for him. 
             [_heads to door_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, suit yourself, Niles.  I think you're fretting 
             needlessly.
     **Sherry:**[_takes remote_] Come on, let's fire this baby up.  Do you like 
             the Nashville Network?
    **Frasier:** Oh, who am I kidding?!  I'm worried sick!
    
    [_Frasier and Niles exit as Sherry sits down with the remote._]
    
    [_Scene Four - Horse Stables.
    Martin is feeding Agides as the boys enter quietly._]
    
    **Martin:** Here you go.  Hey, no offense, but your teeth look like hell! 
            I gotta tell you, the rest of you's not looking that much 
            better either.  Do you want me to give you a little rubdown, 
            huh? [_he uses the brush_] Ah, that takes me back.  Of course, 
            your coat was a lot shinier in those days.  Hell, so was mine. 
            [_laughs_] We were something, weren't we Agides, huh?  Riding 
            crowd control.  People'd just step aside to let us pass.  Now, 
            they're putting you out to pasture and I'm riding the buses. 
            It's fun getting old, isn't it?!  Hey, this is a nice place 
            here, you know.  I bet you're really going to like it here.
    
    [_A horse near the entrance begins to lick Niles's face.  He makes some 
    noise whilst trying to stop him, however Frasier quiets him._]
    
     **Martin:** And you know, if you don't like it here, then we'll do what 
             we said we would.  We'll just go to Montana, start a ranch. 
             [_the boys are shocked_] You know, we still got all that money 
             we took from those drug dealers buried in the old box 
             canyon.
    **Frasier:**[_realises_] All right, dad, we know you know we're here.
     **Martin:** Well, why don't you get the hell out of here?
      **Niles:** Dad...
     **Martin:** Look, I just want to be alone with him, is that all right 
             with you?
    **Frasier:** All right, fine, we'll see you later. [_starts to exit, then_] 
             You know, it is a little troubling that you feel more 
             comfortable talking to your horse than you do to your sons.
      **Niles:** Actually, we might be able to help you with what you're 
             going through; the ageing process...
     **Martin:** Now, come on, now, stop it.  You see, this is the problem. 
             I know everything you're going to say.  First of all, you'll 
             start talking about sixty-five as being some sort of 
             passage.  And then you'll start spouting these theories and 
             quoting Freud and who knows what else until by the time you 
             get through analysing me, I'm going to be sixty-six!  Look, 
             when I tell Agides something, you know what he does? 
             Nothing.  He just listens to me.
      **Niles:** We listen.
    **Frasier:** That's my slogan; "I'm Listening."  You know, dad, listening 
             is the foundation...
    
    [_Niles and Frasier start rabbiting on about the usefulness of 
    listening without putting their theory into practice.  Martin glances 
    at them._]
    
    **Frasier:** Right.
      **Niles:** Shush.
    **Frasier:** Shush!
     **Martin:** When I saw Agides today, it was kinda of a shock to see how 
             old he's gotten and I just... It made me realise how old 
             I've gotten.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you still have a lot of...
     **Martin:** Now, come on...
    **Frasier:** Sorry, sorry.
     **Martin:** Look, it's not a problem you can solve, Frasier.  It's just 
             a fact of life.  People get old.
      **Niles:** Well, I guess this horse wasn't quite the banner gift I 
             thought it would be.
     **Martin:** Oh, yes, it was, Niles.  I'm feeling a little bit sorry for 
             myself right now, but I'll get over that.  But I love this 
             horse, it's the greatest present I've ever gotten.
    
    [_Niles notices Frasier beginning to writhe in envy again._]
    
      **Niles:** Well, I'm glad, dad, but, you know, I think I may have 
             misled you.  The horse is from me _and_ from Frasier.
    
    [_Frasier is moved by this._]
    
     **Martin:** Oh, Jeez, I'm sorry.  Thanks a lot, Fras'.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, it was mostly Niles's idea.
     **Martin:** Well, then, thanks to both of you.
    
    [_The three Crane man are happy._]
    
     **Martin:** It's just great.  Well, come on, we ought to get going.  
             Let's get a move on. [_to Agides_] See ya, buddy. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, what a generous gesture.  How can I ever thank you?
      **Niles:** Well... [_takes out his mobile_] by calling your super and 
             getting rid of that monstrosity in your apartment!  
             I do visit from time to time, you know.
    
    [_Niles dials a number on his mobile and hands it to Frasier._]
    
    [_End of Act Two_]
    
    **Credits:**
    
    That evening, the corridor outside Frasier's apartment contains all 
    the speakers and the big screen TV. The elevator doors open as 
    Frasier and Niles drag Martin off whilst he wears the blindfold.  They 
    guide him past the eyesores and into the apartment where a worker is 
    removing the final speakers.  They get Martin to the table, take off 
    his blindfold and show him his cake.  Daphne and Sherry divert his 
    attention whilst Frasier throws the remote to a worker as he closes 
    the door on the present.
