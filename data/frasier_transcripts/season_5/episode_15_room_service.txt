    _ACT ONE_
    **THE ICE WOMAN COMETH**
    _Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is on the air.  He has just begun to listen to Betsy._
    
    **Frasier:** Good afternoon, Betsy.  I'm listening.
      **Betsy:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane.  My problem is that my husband wants to 
             take me on a cruise for our anniversary.
    **Frasier:** Well, that sounds enchanting.
    _Roz holds up a card that says "bathroom."  Frasier dismisses it._
    
      **Betsy:** Yes, except I keep having this dream where I'm in a cabin 
             asleep, and I see a drop of water beginning to leak up and 
             at first it's just a trickle, but then it's a stream, and 
             then it's gushing, pouring water everywhere and there's 
             nothing in the world that I can do to stop this.
    _These words eventually get to Roz and all she can do is leave without 
    permission._
    
    **Frasier:** That's a very powerful image, wouldn't you say so, Roz? [_sees
             she has gone_] Roz agrees. 
    _Meanwhile, Roz bumps into Boston's ice woman in the corridor.  
    Roz, however, must cross her legs together._
    
     **Lilith:** Excuse me, I'm looking for Frasier Crane, they said he was 
             up here. 
        **Roz:** Lilith it's me, Roz... Doyle.
     **Lilith:**[_recognizing_] Oh yes, Frasier's fun-loving producer.. [_sees
             Roz's pregnant lump_] ...who's apparently having a bit too much
             fun loving.
        **Roz:** You know, I'd love to send one back at you, but I gotta pee! 
    _Roz runs off to the little girls' room as Lilith enters listening to 
    Frasier's final thoughts._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Well that's all the time we have today.  This is
             Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a good day and good mental...
             [_sees Lilith_] AHHH! [_explains_] I'm sorry, someone just walked 
             into the room and frightened me.  It's, uh, my ex-wife, so if 
             you're a regular listener you'll know what I'm talking about!  
             I'll see you Monday.
    
    _Frasier signs off and enters Roz's booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello Lilith. 
     **Lilith:** Surprise.
    **Frasier:** Yeah well, we're past that now, aren't we?  Well, what brings 
             you to Seattle?
     **Lilith:** I'm here for the national conference on self-psychology. 
    **Frasier:** Oh!  And how is Frederick?
     **Lilith:** Fine.  We have an amazing child.
    **Frasier:** Yes, we have.  And, uh, Brian?
     **Lilith:** Fine.  I have an amazing husband.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes.  So, did you two get that gift basket I sent you 
             for the holidays?
    _Lilith falls down crying as Roz runs back into the booth, confused by 
    the matter._
    
        **Roz:** What did you do to her?
    **Frasier:** Nothing, I sent her a gift basket, fruits and festive nuts!
     **Lilith:** Oh, it's not the basket, you nit!  It's Brian... he left me.
        **Roz:** Maybe I should go.
     **Lilith:** Oh no, everyone else knows, you might as well know it too.
             Brian was looking for someone a bit more feminine... and he
             found him! 
    _Frasier and Roz trade a shocked look._
     **Lilith:** Oh, Stan Jablonski, that little hussy! [_Roz leaves_] 
    **Frasier:** Oh, [_takes her in his arms_] Lilith, oh, I am genuinely sorry.
     **Lilith:** I didn't know where to turn, but I knew somehow you'd be here
             for me.
    **Frasier:** So you didn't come for the conference? 
     **Lilith:** No.
    **Frasier:** You know, you really shouldn't be alone tonight.  Er, Niles
             and I are atending a reception at the Union Club, would you
             like to join us?
     **Lilith:** Oh thank you Frasier, I'd love to.  I don't if I deserve your 
             compassion, but I feel better already just holding your strong 
             comforting hands. 
    **Frasier:** You know I'll always be here for you.
    
    _They stand and embrace._
    
     **Lilith:** Oh, I could stay in these arms all day.
    **Frasier:** Ah, [_looks at watch_] yes - well, em, you'll have to excuse me.
             I have an appointment, station manager, very important, 
             can't be broken. I'll, em, see you tonight. [_delirious_] 
             Bye bye.
    
    _Frasier slowly walks away.  He is very rigid and cannot believe what 
    has just happened.  He exits as Roz enters._
    
       **Roz:** Hey, that's rough; leaving you for another man!  Did you have 
            any idea?
    **Lilith:** No, none at all.  Stan was a contractor we had hired to extend
            our master bedroom.  It's ironic, isn't it - no sooner do I get
            the closet of my dreams than my husband comes out of it. 
    
    _Lilith exits, leaving a bewildered Roz behind.
    
    FADE OUT_ 
    
    **STRANGE INTERLUDE**
    
    _Scene Two - Cafe Nervosa
    Later that day, Niles is at a table when Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Ah, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**[_sees what he's eating_] Mmm, that bun looks good.
      **Niles:** Now, now, remember your diet.
    **Frasier:**[_sits_] Speaking of buns I could do without, Lilith is back!
      **Niles:** Oh, that explains why blood was pouring from all my faucets
             this morning.
    **Frasier:** Now go easy on her.  Her husband has left her, and get this:
             for a man.
      **Niles:** Damn!  I owe Dad five dollars!
    **Frasier:** Poor thing, she's obviously devastated - her entire world has 
             been turned upside down.  Oh, look who I'm talking to.  No one
             knows better than you how much a messy divorce can leave one...
    _Frasier notices that Niles has fallen asleep and is snoring loudly._
    
    **Frasier:**...strangely relaxed!  Niles? [_taps him_] Niles!
      **Niles:**[_as if nothing had happened_] Yes?
    **Frasier:** Am I boring you?
      **Niles:** Did I do it again?  I'm sorry Frasier, it seems I'm suffering
             through a bout of narcolepsy.
    **Frasier:** Good lord!  When did this start?
      **Niles:** Right after we started divorce proceedings.  I checked with
             my doctor, I'm fine - it's a reaction to stress.  It's my way
             of escaping the whole ugly mess!  But I'm terribly sorry, go 
             on with what you were saying.
    **Frasier:** Well, obviously Lilith is distraught and she's come to me to 
             help her make sense of the whole thing.  I find it just a bit
             disconcerting.
      **Niles:** How so?
    **Frasier:** Well, we have a destructive pattern: whenever she comes to me 
             in need I find her vulnerability highly desirable; against my
             better judgment we end up in bed and I'm left with feelings
             of regret.
      **Niles:** And you felt this way about her today?
    **Frasier:** Oh baby! 
      **Niles:** Well, do your best to avoid her.
    **Frasier:** Well, I can't!  She's joining us at the Union Club tonight.
      **Niles:** What, she's going to be there?!
    **Frasier:** Come on Niles, it's just a bunch of stuffed shirts talking
             about their portfolios and prostates.
      **Niles:** Exactly, and you've ruined it!
    
    _Niles's mobile phone rings, so he answers it._ 
    
      **Niles:**[_to phone_] Yes? [_to Frasier_] Damn, it's one of Maris's cadre 
             of lawyers. [_to phone_] Er, we've been over that.  No, I 
             can't.  How dare you?  She already has the house!  I'm not 
             even allowed to visit the koi pond!  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh...
    
    _Niles falls asleep, so Frasier once again wakes him._
    
      **Niles:**...I'm not even allowed to visit the koi pond! 
    **Frasier:** Give me that! [_takes phone from Niles and speaks into it_]
             He will call you back. [_hangs up_] Lord, aren't we a pair: 
             a narcoleptic and a weak-willed sexual obsessive.  We're 
             like a couple of brothers out of an O'Neill play!
    
    [_N.B. Eugene O'Neill, American playwright - all the title cards are 
    based on the titles of his plays._]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Apartment
    Later in Frasier's apartment Martin is talking to Eddie.  Daphne is 
    tidying up._
     **Martin:** Hey Daph', come down here, I taught him a new trick.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I love animal tricks.  You know, I was reading in a movie
             magazine where there's this stunt dog who they taught to ride
             a motorcycle into a burning building, pick up a baby in its
             teeth, then jump out the window to safety.  What did you teach
             Eddie?
     **Martin:**[_mock proud_] To roll over.
     **Daphne:** You must be very proud.
    
    _Eddie does indeed roll over._
    
     **Martin:** Ah, forget it, Eddie!
    
    _Martin answers the door to Niles._ 
    
     **Martin:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Evening, dad, Daphne.
    **Frasier:**[_enters from kitchen_] Hello, Niles.  Sherry?  I think we have
             time before Lilith arrives.
     **Martin:**[_scared_] What?!  You never said she was coming up here!
     **Daphne:** You just said you were going to dinner!
     **Martin:** You never said she was coming up here!
    **Frasier:** It's just to rendezvous, it's all of two minutes.
     **Martin:** But you never told me!  You've been home an hour and you never 
             told me, not a word, [_to Daphne_] did he say anything to you? 
     **Daphne:** No, nothing. [_to Frasier_] You could have told us, you know,
             we could have made plans to be elsewhere. 
     **Martin:**[_to Daphne_] How come you didn't know about it?  You used 
             to know these things, whenever she came around you'd get a 
             headache!
    
    _They begin arguing until Frasier intervenes._
    
    **Frasier:** Alright, she's coming!  Both of you suck it up!  Lilith has 
             had a devastating week; her husband has left her.  The least 
             you could do is show a little compassion, unless you'd like 
             to hide in your rooms because two minutes of polite 
             conversation with a woman in need is too much to ask!
    _Martin and Daphne look appropriately ashamed.  Then the doorbell rings._
     **Martin:** Outta my way!
     **Daphne:** Me too!
    _They run for the hall and Martin drops his cane.  Daphne moves to pick 
    it up-_
     **Martin:** Leave it!
    _When they have left Niles picks the cane up and stands it up. 
    Frasier goes to answer the door._
    
      **Niles:** Remember Frasier, I'm here for you in case you feel yourself
             starting to weaken. 
    **Frasier:** Oh I'm fine, believe me: I'm in complete control!
    _Frasier answers the door to Lilith.  He is knocked back by her 
    appearance. She has her hair down and a short dress on.  She has 
    a silk wrap around her arms._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh baby!
     **Lilith:** Thank you Frasier, I needed that.  I treated myself to a 
             little shopping this afternoon.  Probably just a pathetic
             attempt to compensate for the battering my ego's taken
             recently - it's pretty transparent, huh?
    **Frasier:**[_with his mind elsewhere_] No, but if you stand in the light
             maybe...
      **Niles:** Frasier!
     **Lilith:**[_sees Niles_] Niles, sorry to hear your marriage ended in a
             shambles.
      **Niles:** Ditto.
    **Frasier:** Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way, let me
             take your wrap. 
    _He takes it off her, revealing that the back is cut down to the base
    of her spine._
    **Frasier:** Yowsa!  Oh Lilith, that dress is stunning.
      **Niles:** Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
    **Frasier:** No! 
     **Lilith:** It's from a new Couture line called "Encore!"
    **Frasier:** Well... bravo!  I can almost feel the curtain rising!
      **Niles:** Frasier!  Excuse us, we'll be right back.  Eddie will 
             entertain you.
    
    _Frasier and Niles exit to the kitchen.  Lilith is left on her own as 
    Eddie jumps up onto the chair._
     **Lilith:** Hello, Eddie.
    _He runs away, leaving her in tears. 
    
    Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Niles is getting a drink out of the fridge 
    as Frasier prattles on._
    **Frasier:** Damn her lily-white hide!  She knows what she's doing dressing 
             like that!  That woman plays me like a lute -- well, I guess 
             you know a thing or two about that!  Huh!  I've got all the 
             resistance of a horny stag!  Niles, you've gotta help me get 
             through this... Niles! 
    _Frasier realizes he's fallen asleep again in the fridge.  Frasier wakes 
    him up._ 
    
      **Niles:** Did I do it again?
    **Frasier:** Yes, you fell asleep with your cheek right next to the ice 
             tray!
      **Niles:** Oh, that's so strange.  I dreamt I was tangoing with Maris!
    **Frasier:** Niles, I need your help resisting Lilith!
      **Niles:** Alright, alright, let me think, let me think... I think I have 
             the answer.  When you feel yourself yielding to her, summon an 
             image so repellant you will be incapable of any sexual desire.  
             [_thinks, then_] Remember the summer we were at Uncle Henry's 
             farm and found that dead horse lying in the hot sun crawling 
             with maggots?
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.
      **Niles:** Hold onto that picture.  You can ride that horse to safety.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Niles, that just might do the trick.  When it comes 
             to an ugly image, you can't beat a dead horse! [_guns down his 
             drink_]
      **Niles:** Feel up to facing her again?
    **Frasier:** Yes!  Let her bat her eyes all she wants to, she can push her 
             breasts up to Canada, I won't budge!
    _Niles chucks him on the shoulder, and they go out again.
    
    FADE TO:_
    Scene Four - Hotel
    In her hotel room, Lilith is lying naked in bed, entwined with a man.
    However, the man is under the covers. 
    
     **Lilith:** Morning.
    _The man reveals himself with a sigh; it's Niles._
      **Niles:** Morning.
    
    _END OF ACT ONE (Time: 10:00) 
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **LONG NIGHT'S
    JOURNEY INTO DAY**
    _Scene Five - Hotel
    Niles and Lilith slowly wake up and realize what they've done.  
    They gasp and pull away from each other in bed._ 
    
     **Lilith:** My God!  What did we do?  What did we do?
      **Niles:** Well, first you put your...
     **Lilith:** I know what we did!  What do we do now?!
      **Niles:** Let's just stay calm.  These things happen, they happen every 
             day... [_losing it_] every day in Arkansas!  
    
    [_N.B. The line in an earlier draft was, "Everyday in France and people 
    die for it!"_]
    
      **Niles:** Frasier is going to kill us!  Oh, why did you have to look 
             so damned bewitching all evening? 
     **Lilith:** Why did you have to drive me home and walk me to my door?
      **Niles:** Oh, there's no point pointing fingers.  We both know why
             this happened; last night was simply two wounded people
             overcome with loneliness, confusion and...
     **Lilith:** Tequila shooters.
      **Niles:**[_moaning_] Mmm-hmm.
    _There's a knock at the door, which scares Niles to death.
    Lilith starts to pull on a robe._
    
      **Niles:**[_whispering_] Who's that?!
     **Lilith:** Don't panic, no one knows we're here.
      **Niles:** I told Frasier I was driving you home.
     **Lilith:**[_panicked, whispering_] Why did you do a stupid thing like 
             that?!
      **Niles:** Well, it wasn't stupid at the time!  How did I know the minute
             we got in this room you'd be on me like a hawk on a titmouse! 
    _The knock sounds again.  Lilith goes to the door while Niles pulls on 
    a robe._
    
     **Lilith:** Just be quiet. [_clears throat_] Who is it?
     **Waiter:**[_o.s._] Room Service, ma'am.
     **Lilith:** Ah that's right, we ordered breakfast last night. 
    
    _Lilith opens the door to a waiter pushing a cart with two plates on 
    it._ 
    
     **Waiter:** Good morning ma'am, good morning sir.  I have Eggs Benedict
             and Eggs Florentine.
     **Lilith:** Did you bring ketchup?
     **Waiter:** Uh, no.  Sorry, let me get that for you right now.
      **Niles:**[_confused_] Ketchup on Eggs Florentine?
     **Waiter:**[_charmed_] Oh!  Your, uh, first breakfast together?
     **Lilith:**[_mad_] Just get it! 
    
    _He leaves as Niles examines the food._
    
      **Niles:** Now I remember ordering this; it's the breakfast I always
             have after a night of passion.
     **Lilith:** Eggs Benedict?  That's very rich.
      **Niles:** I only have it once a year. 
    _The door is knocked on again._
     **Lilith:** That was quick. [_goes to answer it_]
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] Lilith, are you awake?
     **Lilith:** It's Frasier!
      **Niles:** Oh my God!  What do we do?
     **Lilith:** Hide in the bathroom!
      **Niles:** Right!
    _Niles runs in, but Lilith runs in with him.  He pushes her out._
      **Niles:** No, not you!
    **Frasier:** Lilith?
    _She realizes the food cart could be a sign there are two people there 
    so she has a plan..._
     **Lilith:** Wait, take the cart with you! [_pushes it into bathroom with 
             Niles_]
      **Niles:**[_stops it_] Wait!  Food in the bathroom? 
     **Lilith:** Oh, just go!
    _Lilith pushes the cart in with Niles and goes to answer the door. 
    It's Frasier, and he's switched on horny mode._
     **Lilith:** Hello, Frasier.  What are you doing here?
    **Frasier:** Surrendering, Lilith.  I'm yours! [_grabs her_]
     **Lilith:** Oh - no...
    **Frasier:** Oh please, don't punish me for playing hard to get last night!  
             It took everything I had to resist you.
     **Lilith:** Oh, this isn't right...
    **Frasier:** Oh, who cares?! [_embraces her_] You're gonna tell me that when 
             you were lying in your bed last night you weren't thinking 
             about me?
     **Lilith:**[_honestly_] Yes! 
    **Frasier:** Oh, drop the mask, Lilith!  We both know why you came to 
             Seattle. 
             We both know why you dressed so enticingly last night.
     **Lilith:** Oh, well...
    _There is a sound of a toilet flushing from the bathroom.  Lilith looks 
    pensively at Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** There's someone in your bathroom?
     **Lilith:** No, it's a defective toilet.  It's been doing that all night,
             I think I'll just go check it now.
    _Lilith enters the bathroom to confront Niles.  However his narcolepsy 
    has taken over and he is asleep on the flush._
    
     **Lilith:**[_whispering_] Niles!
      **Niles:**[_as if nothing happened_] Yes?
     **Lilith:** You fell asleep and flushed the toilet!
      **Niles:** Damn!  Is he still here?
     **Lilith:** Yes.  He wants to make love to me.
      **Niles:** Does the man have no scruples?!  He specifically asked me last 
             night to keep him away from you.  But the minute my back is 
             turned he sneaks back here - and yes, I'm aware of the irony. 
     **Lilith:** I'll just ask him to leave. 
    _Lilith opens the bathroom door and enters the main room to ask Frasier 
    to leave.  However Frasier has already shed his clothes and changed 
    into a dressing gown._
    
     **Lilith:** My God!
    **Frasier:**[_saucily_] My Goddess! 
    _The waiter knocks on the door but Lilith needs to settle matters._
    
     **Lilith:**[_to waiter_] Go away!
     **Waiter:**[_o.s._] But I've got your ketchup, ma'am.
     **Lilith:** Not necessary.
     **Waiter:** OK, but I still need the bill.
     **Lilith:** Later. 
    **Frasier:** Well, let's just take care of this... 
    
    _Frasier opens the door to the waiter._
    
     **Waiter:** I'm sorry to disturb you, but here's the... [_realizes it's a 
             different man_] ketchup. [_hands it over_] Sorry it took so... 
             long.  I, er, still need the bill. [_looks around room_] Where's 
             the cart?
     **Lilith:** In the bathroom.
    **Frasier:** Why is the breakfast cart in the bathroom?
     **Lilith:** Ah, I was going to take a hot bath while I ate.
    **Frasier:** Still, food in the bathroom?
     **Lilith:** Be right back. 
    
    _She enters the bathroom to get the bill._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to waiter_] Well, this is a little embarrassing.  My ex-wife,
             we're sort of reconnecting. 
     **Waiter:**[_knowing better_] Yes sir, that's ...er... wonderful. 
    **Frasier:** You never know, it might just work out this time.
     **Waiter:**[_sarcastically_] Oh...kay.
     **Lilith:**[_enters with money_] There you go, [_bribing_] There's a 
             generous, _generous_ tip in there for you.
     **Waiter:**[_understanding_] Thank you, ma'am.
    **Frasier:** Say, listen - while you're still here, why don't you send up
             an order of Eggs Benedict?  There's no reason why she should
             eat alone. 
     **Waiter:**[_looks at Lilith_] Oh...kay.
    
    _The waiter leaves, letting Frasier resume his seductive lures._
    
    **Frasier:** Now, where were we?
     **Lilith:** Oh, this isn't a good time for this, really.
    **Frasier:** Why not?  Lilith, please, we're alone, we're here, you need 
             your Frasier-
    _There is a clatter in the bathroom; the sound of a dinner tray falling 
    to the floor.  This raises Frasier's suspicions._
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell was that?! [_goes to the bathroom door_]
     **Lilith:** No, Frasier, wait, don't go in there!  Wait!
    _Lilith tries to keep Frasier back, but he pushes her out of the way 
    and enters the bathroom.  Niles is fast asleep with his head on his 
    order of Eggs Benedict._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!!
      **Niles:**[_as if nothing had happened_] Yes? [_shocked to see Frasier_]
    **Frasier:** My God!
     **Lilith:** Frasier, I'm sorry, we didn't mean for this to happen...
    **Frasier:**_OH MY GOD!_
      **Niles:** It was a mistake, a horrible, misguided mistake-
    **Frasier:**[_half mad_] Stop it, Niles!  Stop it!  Don't tell me how or 
             why, I've just got to get out of here!
    
    _Confused and still in his bathrobe, he runs out of the room._
    
     **Lilith:** Oh, Frasier, Frasier!
    
    _But he's gone.  Niles sinks onto the bed._
    
      **Niles:** This is my worst nightmare.
     **Lilith:** You have egg on your face.
      **Niles:** That is an understatement!
     **Lilith:** No, actual egg!
    _Niles looks up at Lilith and we see he has "scrambled eggs all over 
    his face."  Someone knocks on the door again.  She goes to answer it._
     **Lilith:** It's in your hair too!
    
    _Frasier enters, still looking mad._
    
      **Niles:** I knew you couldn't stay mad at us.
    **Frasier:** I'm in a bathrobe, you jackass!
    _Frasier begins to pull his trousers on before listening to Lilith._
    
     **Lilith:** I can understand your shock, and believe me, if I could erase
             everything that happened last night, I would.  But, if you 
             could just look at this rationally, just for a moment - we
             didn't technically do anything wrong.
    **Frasier:**[_outraged_] What?  You didn't do anything wrong?!
      **Niles:** I'm a little unclear on that myself, but I'm willing to go
             along with it!
     **Lilith:** You and I are no longer married.  Neither is Niles.  I won't
             say this is my shining hour, but we are not responsible to you 
             or anyone else for our actions. 
    **Frasier:** You're actually defending what you did?!
     **Lilith:** Just listen; the past few days have been THE worst of my life.  
             I have never been less self-assured, or more in need of 
             validation, both as a person and especially as a woman.  
             Niles was feeling the same thing.
      **Niles:** Exactly. [_realizes the woman part_] Wait a minute...
     **Lilith:** Our physical reaction to each other was nothing more than a
             desperate attempt to reaffirm our own worth.
    **Frasier:** Well... that is very impressive, Dr. Sternin.  But I too 
             happen to be a psychiatrist.  Let me tell you what actually 
             transpired.  This was a passive-aggressive manifestation of 
             your deep resentments towards me.  Niles, you were punishing 
             me for my notoriety. [_to Lilith_] You, for my successful 
             adjustment after our divorce.  It is this shared bond that 
             brought the two of you to your palace of sweet revenge!
     **Lilith:** Allow me to rebut: what a crock!
    **Frasier:** It is not!
     **Lilith:** It is so!  This is yet another example of your complete self-
             absorption, which is the reason we could not stay together 
             in the first place!
    **Frasier:** I have a right to... [_realizes_] Why am _I_ defending myself?!
      **Niles:** If you ask me, you are both off the mark.  Last night was 
             about two people, ruled by very powerful superegos - tortured 
             by them, who found a chance - however misguided - to break 
             through and rediscover their ids together.  Call me an old 
             softie, but that's how I see it.
    **Frasier:** OK, then... the three of us have certainly analyzed the 
             CRAP out of this! 
      **Niles:** Yes, where do we all go from here? 
    **Frasier:** I don't know. 
    _Niles's mobile rings and he goes to answer it.  Lilith and Frasier try 
    to settle things quietly._ 
    
     **Lilith:** You realize that if you had simply given into me last night
             instead of this morning, the three of us would not be in
             this hell.
    **Frasier:** No, it would be the two of us in a whole different hell!
    
    _Meanwhile, Niles is getting mad with the lawyers on the phone..._
    
      **Niles:**[_to phone_] Well, I don't give a damn!  I've been manipulated
             by you jackals enough, I'll see you in court! [_puts phone 
             away_] The very idea that Maris still thinks she can... [_still 
             alert_] Hey, I'm not sleepy.  That conversation should have put 
             me out like a light!
     **Lilith:** Well, it's not surprising.  Your experience with Maris has
             been emasculating.  Last night may have gone a long way
             towards restoring your self-confidence.
      **Niles:** Of course!  And by the same token you can now give up the
             neurotic assumption that Brian left you because you are
             unattractive.  You have ample evidence to the contrary.
     **Lilith:** Yes, I have! [_smugly_] Well, to hell with Brian!  If he wants 
             a prissy little wife, he can keep Stan! 
    **Frasier:** So, [_sarcastically_] isn't this peachy!  Everything's turned
             out just fine for everyone.  You two have solved your
             problems, the waiter received a handsome tip, Niles and I
             have matching bathrobes, and looky here!  It's not even nine-
             thirty yet! [_points to watch_]
     **Lilith:** Frasier, try to understand...
      **Niles:** Yes, what happened last night was just...
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it, both of you!  Enough!  It happened, and I'm just 
             going to have to deal with it. [_bitter chuckle_] I suppose in a 
             twisted way there is one positive for me in this: you see, 
             Lilith, I have never stopped desiring you - even though we are 
             _completely_ wrong for each other!  But now, from this day 
             forward, whenever I look at you, I will see the back of my
             brother's head!  And that is one bucket of ice water, let me
             tell ya!
     **Lilith:** You know, Frasier...
    **Frasier:** Enough, Lilith.
     **Lilith:** Alright.  Maybe, I'll just go... have some breakfast. [_she 
             exits to bathroom_]
      **Niles:** Are we OK?
    **Frasier:** No, we're not... but we will be.
      **Niles:** Well, that's enough for now. [_waits, and then perkily_] 
             We're an odd little family, aren't we?
    _There is a voice from the other side of the door - it's the waiter. 
    Niles goes to answer it._ 
    
     **Waiter:** Here's your Eggs Benedict, if you could just... 
    _He nearly faints when he sees no Lilith, just two men in bathrobes._ 
    
     **Waiter:** Oh...kay! 
    
    _The waiter leaves along with this episode as the Crane boys look 
    sorrowfully at each other.
    
    END OF ACT TWO (Time: 21:10)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    In the bathroom, Lilith sits on the toilet and pulls up her cart 
    to enjoy her breakfast.  She gets settled before dousing her Eggs 
    Florentine in tomato ketchup.  After she pours herself a cup of 
    tea, she finally begins eating this catering disaster for people 
    with acquired (Lilith only) taste.
