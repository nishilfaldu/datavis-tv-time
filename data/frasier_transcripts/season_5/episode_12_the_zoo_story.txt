    _Act One
    
    Scene One - Int. Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier is ordering his coffee at the counter.  Bebe Glazer 
    approaches._
    
       **Bebe:** Well, well, well, look who's here.  It's KACL's Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** And Rosemary's Bebe.
    
    _Pause.  Frasier turns back to the counter._
    
       **Bebe:** So, quite a little shake-up going on down at the station.
            I hear the new owner wants to renegotiate everyone's contract.
    **Frasier:**[_turning head_] Mmm-hmm.  And before you drop another gossamer 
             hint, let me tell you that my feelings about you haven't 
             changed.
       **Bebe:** Fine!  Actually, I'm here to meet one of my newer clients, 
             a rising star of the Seattle airwaves.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really, and what pathetic do-gooder have you lured into 
             your web now?
    
    _Roz enters, looking self-conscious._
    
       **Bebe:**[_overly affectionate_] Roz!
    **Frasier:**[_surprised_] Oh, dear God.
    
    _Bebe walks over to Roz and points her toward a table._
    
       **Bebe:** You just get off your feet, little mother.  I'll fetch you       
             a nice, nourishing muffin.
    
    _Roz begins to walk toward the table, still self-conscious, trying to 
    keep her back to Frasier.  Frasier follows her, glaring._
    
    **Frasier:** You signed with Bebe?
        **Roz:**[_sitting_] Okay, I know, I should've told you, I just wasn't 
             in the mood for one of your lectures.
    **Frasier:**[_sitting across from her_] I'm not going to give you a lecture.  
             You're entitled to choose whoever you wish to represent you.  
             Someone who's honest, or a woman whose ethics would've raised 
             eyebrows in the court of Caligula!
        **Roz:** Look, she's gotten me three voice-over jobs.  She may be a 
             little shifty, but she helps me put food on the table.
    
    _Bebe approaches, muffin in hand, and places it before Roz_
    
       **Bebe:** One muffin.
        **Roz:** See?
       **Bebe:**[_sitting; pats Roz's belly_] So, Roz, I had a brainstorm last 
             night about how to turn this little bundle of joy into a big 
             bundle of cash!
        **Roz:**[_confused_] I'm going to use my baby to make money?
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] Yes, it's high time the little slacker started 
             pulling his weight!
       **Bebe:**[_to Roz_] You know Doctor Clint Weber's medical show?  Well, 
             I see a daily segment called, "A Pregnant Pause: Roz Doyle's 
             Term of Endearment."  All of Seattle will share in the miracle 
             happening inside you - your joys, hopes, morning sickness, 
             sonograms, even the birth! [_excited_]
        **Roz:**[_still confused_] I'll give birth on the air?
       **Bebe:** It's radio.  Just make the noises. [_laughing_] Hell, I'll 
             make them myself!
    
    _A waitress approaches._
    
    **Waitress:** Need anything else here?
     **Frasier:** Just a shower, thank you.
        **Bebe:** You know, Mr. Integrity, word on the street is you still 
              haven't hired anyone to negotiate this big deal for you. 
              [_Frasier stands_] Could it be because in your heart you know 
              you want to come back to me?
     **Frasier:** Yes, well if I'm taking my time it's because I'm determined 
              to make the right choice.
         **Roz:** Well, you're gonna need somebody good!
     **Frasier:** That's exactly what I intend to find, someone good!  I'm 
              going to prove to both of you it's possible to find an 
              agent who can drive a hard bargain and yet maintain the 
              highest ethical standards! 
        **Bebe:**[_sarcastic_] Happy hunting.  If things don't work out, you 
              know my number.
     **Frasier:**[_walking out door_] Still 666, is it?!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Int. Frasier's apartment
    Martin opens the front door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:**[_walks in_] Hello, Dad.  I believe we switched videotapes on 
             accident.
     **Martin:** Believe me, I noticed.
      **Niles:** Yes, there you go. [_hands over video_] At first I was dismayed.  
             I popped in the tape, and there was Charles Bronson blowing 
             away street trash, but I actually got into it.  It was quite 
             suspenseful.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, that's the way Duke and I felt about "My Dinner 
             With Andre."  Talk about suspense! [_fake, dramatic 
             anticipation_] Will they order dessert?  Will they leave a good 
             tip? [_walks to chair and sits_]
    
    _Frasier enters from the direction of his bedroom._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'm sorry to trouble you about this, but could you 
             recommend another couples' therapist?
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, not again.  What happened to Dr. Prescott?
      **Niles:** Oh, please, Maris had me can Dr. Prescott weeks ago.  Now she 
             wants me to fire Dr. Wilphaum.
    
    _Frasier walks in the direction of the kitchen, perhaps to get a 
    drink from the wet bar._
    
    **Frasier:** What's her problem with him?
      **Niles:** She says his criticism of her is too harsh.
    **Frasier:** Well, some therapists can be rather blunt and hard-hitting.
             What did he say?
      **Niles:** He asked her to refrain from catalogue shopping during our 
             sessions. [_sits on couch_]
    **Frasier:** You know Niles, if you fire every therapist who finds fault 
             with her, you're never going to make any progress.
      **Niles:** You're right, of course.  I'll just tell her, "We're not going 
             to change therapists, that's that." [_stands_]
    **Frasier:** Good!  You know, sometimes there's nothing more rewarding 
             than sticking to a principle.  Case in point, you know, my 
             contract's coming up, and, uh, well, Bebe Glazer's been 
             angling to negotiate my new one.  Anyway, I could've done the 
             easy thing, said yes, taken the money and run, but instead, 
             I said no, and I found myself a new agent, one who's every 
             bit as smart and also ethical.
      **Niles:** Hmmm.
    
    _Doorbell._
    
    **Frasier:** That's him now.
    
    _Frasier and Niles head toward the door._
    
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know what kinda bull that guy sold you, but 
             there's no such thing as an ethical agent.  One's just as 
             slimy as the other.
    
    _Frasier opens the door.  Ben enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Ben.
        **Ben:** Hi.  Sorry I'm late.  I was making my last Meals on Wheels 
             delivery and I swerved to avoid a pigeon.  You know, splat 
             went the food all over the stuffed bears for the toy drive. 
             I had to run home, throw the bears in the wash, and cook 
             some more borsht for Mrs. Pavlov.
    **Frasier:** I'm glad you made it.  Anyway, this is my brother, Doctor 
             Niles Crane.
        **Ben:** Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you.
      **Niles:** Hi. [_shakes his hand, leaving_] Sorry, I'm running out. 
             [_turns, laughing_] You're certainly a refreshing change from 
             Frasier's last agent.  I think she would have swerved to hit 
             the pigeon. [_another laugh_]
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] Well, she would have swerved to hit Mrs. Pavlov! 
             [_closes door_] Ben, I'd like you to meet my dad, Martin.
    
    _Daphne enters as Frasier leads Ben toward the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, and this is his home health care worker, Daphne.  Daphne, 
             this is Ben, my new agent. 
     **Daphne:**[_shakes Ben's hand_] Oh, very nice to meet you.
    
    _Daphne sits at breakfast table._
    
     **Martin:** Well, Ben, it sounds like you're a pretty busy volunteer.
    **Frasier:** Yes, indeed, you know, Ben just won this year's Seattle 
             Samaritan Award.
        **Ben:**[_quickly_] Well, enough about me.  Let's talk about you. 
             [_gestures to couch_] May I?
    **Frasier:** Oh, please.
        **Ben:**[_sitting_] I was thinking that before we start this 
             negotiation it wouldn't hurt to raise your public profile.
    **Frasier:**[_shrug_] I like the sound of that.
        **Ben:** Okay, here's my plan.  For a year now, I've done pro bono 
             work for the Mercer Island Zoo - you know, getting the word 
             out, creating awareness --
     **Daphne:**[_still sitting at table_] There's a zoo on Mercer Island?
        **Ben:**[_grin_] You betcha.  This'll be great PR for both of you.  
             They just bought a rare crane.  I convinced them to name it 
             after you - you know, Frasier "Crane."  So, there'll be a 
             ceremony with full newspaper and TV coverage.
    **Frasier:** I think it's brilliant! [_sits beside Ben_] I'm bolstering my
             bargaining position and also helping out a plucky little 
             zoo!  I love this man!
     **Daphne:**[_stands and walks over with bowl; places it on coffee table_] 
             I think it would be fun to have a crane named after me.  I 
             just love those big pouchy mouths they scoop up the fish in.
        **Ben:** I think those are pelicans.
     **Daphne:** Oh, right. [_walking back toward breakfast table_] Cranes are 
             the ones who always sound like they're laughing.  No, wait, 
             I'm thinking of loons.
     **Martin:** That's a coincidence.
        **Ben:**[_stands_] Oh, shoot, I've got borsht on my sleeve.  Do you 
             have any club soda?
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes, right through here. [_walking toward kitchen, Ben 
             follows_]
    **Frasier:** Help yourself.
        **Ben:** Thank you.
    
    _Ben and Daphne exit._
    
     **Martin:** Frasier, you told me this was a pretty big deal.  Are you 
             sure you want to send in that Mouseketeer?
    **Frasier:** Oh, why does everybody assume that in order to be an agent 
             you have to be some unscrupulous huckster?  It is possible 
             for a good and decent man to be every bit as intimidating as 
             the toughest shark out there.
        **Ben:**[_entering_] Well, time to skedaddle.  I have to pick up a 
             friend. [_walks toward door; Frasier follows_] The poor guy 
             just went bankrupt, so I'm letting him bunk in my ruckus 
             room for a while.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's awfully generous of you.
        **Ben:** Well, he's not just a friend, he's a client.
    
    _Ben lets himself out, and Frasier closes the door and looks back at 
    Martin shrugging.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **BYE BYE BIRDY**
    
    _Scene Three - Ext. Mercer Island Zoo.
    The Director of the zoo leads Frasier into a tent, where the buffet is.  
    The bird is also in this tent in a small cage._
    
    **Director:** Um, and then the press and the board members will join us 
              in here for a buffet.
     **Frasier:** So I finish my speech, and then I give Mr. Twembly here the 
              cue and he brings out this marvelous creature.
     **Twembly:**[_kneeling beside cage_] Just give me the signal.
      **Martin:**[_enters_] Aw, this is great!  Look at this!  Turkey, chicken 
              wings! [_leans down toward crane_] Hey!  Gotta make you a 
              little nervous, huh?
      **Daphne:**[_walks up to Frasier_] [_hushed voice_] Look!  It's Toffee 
              Macintosh, from the news!  I just love her!
     **Frasier:** Oh, yes, really?
      **Toffee:**[_approaching_] Frasier.
     **Frasier:** Toffee.  Thank you for covering us.
      **Toffee:**[_laugh_] Aw, you know my motto, "If it happens in Seattle, 
              it's news to me." [_laugh_]
     **Frasier:** Listen, I'd like you to meet one of your biggest fans, 
              Daphne Moon.
      **Daphne:** Hello.  I just love the way you get all somber when you 
              describe a flood or a murder, then you cheer right up the 
              minute you're done!  Makes me think, well, if she can get 
              over it, so can I.
      **Toffee:** That's what I'm here for.
         **Ben:**[_enters_] Ready to greet your public?
     **Frasier:** Well, uh, yes!  Come on, Dad!
      **Martin:**[_eating_] All right, I'll be there in a sec.
    
    _All but Martin walk toward the seating area.
    
    The outdoors, grassy area is set up for Frasier's program.  In front 
    of a large sign that says "Mercer Island Zoo" is a podium.  In front 
    of this is a row of chairs for the audience.
    
    Roz sits to the side smiling brightly with a monkey in her lap.  
    Bebe is beside her.  Several cameras are on them._
    
       **Bebe:** Why, you see what maternal instincts this woman has?  Even 
             little Bobo here can sense it.
    **Frasier:**[_approaching Bebe and Roz_] Well, I can see I'm not the only 
             one getting some publicity today.
        **Ben:**[_joins them_] Frasier, they want to start pretty soon.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Ben, Ben, just a moment, I'd like you to meet some 
             people.  This is Bebe and Roz.  This is Ben, my new agent.
    
    _Improv hellos._
    
        **Ben:** Hey, talk about your small worlds.  Turns out Mr. Twembly 
             and I both sang tenor for the same choir back home in Salt 
             Lake City.  Nice meeting you ladies.
       **Bebe:**[_evil laugh; very sarcastic_] Well, when there's a dirty job 
             to be done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon.
    **Frasier:**[_indignant_] Scoff all you like, the man is a genius at PR.
    
    _The program starts.  The audience in the front row, from left to 
    right, is: Bebe, Roz, Daphne, and a few places over from them, Ben. 
    Ben looks excited._
    
    **Twembly:** Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  On behalf of the 
             Mercer Island Zoo, I'd like to welcome our very special 
             guest, Doctor Frasier Crane. [_applause_]
    **Frasier:**[_steps up to podium_] Thank you, Mr. Twembly.  I suppose it's 
             only appropriate that the zoo has called upon me to introduce 
             you all to its newest resident.  You see, he happens to be a 
             relative of mine. [_laugh_]
    
    _Bored looks from Bebe and Roz.
    
    CUT TO:
    Martin is alone in the tent with the Crane, still eating._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, what're you lookin' at?  This is human food.  You don't 
             see me lookin' at your bird food, do you? [_turns away from 
             bird and toward the buffet; bird bites the seat of Martin's 
             pants; turns back around_] What do you think you're doing, huh?  
             That's not very nice! [_shakes his cane at the bird; cane 
             catches on cage, opening gate; bird jumps out_]. Oh, wait, 
             wait, no, no, no, wait, where you goin'?!
    
    _CUT TO:
    
    Frasier is at the podium speaking.  As he speaks, the bird runs behind 
    him.  Then, Martin runs by in hot pursuit of the crane, shaking his arm 
    at the bird.  They exit to the right.  Frasier is entirely oblivious._
    **Frasier:**...We're both tall and have distinctive profiles, we've both 
             been known to winter in Mexico, and let's not forget our 
             voices.  Is there anything as stirring as the crane's 
             majestic cry?
     **Martin:**[_o.s_] Yeyaaaaaaaa!  Get this thing off me! [_hobbles in, 
             holding ear_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, are you all right?  What's happening? [_uproar; bird runs 
             behind him, chased by several men_] My goodness!  What is 
             going on! [_turns toward audience, attempting to cover_] Oh, 
             I'm sorry!  Nothing to be alarmed about!  Just a little family 
             squabble!
    
    _The audience is in uproar; Frasier rushes to Martin's aid.
    
    End of Act One
    
    Act Two
    
    Scene One - Int. Frasier's apartment.
    Focus on TV.  Toffee Macintosh is reporting in front of the chaos of 
    the crane ordeal._
    
     **Toffee:** In a gruesome incident this afternoon, the Mercer Island Zoo 
             seemed more like the Island of Doctor Moreau....
    
    _Shift to: Living room.  Martin is sitting in chair with Frasier to 
    his right and Daphne behind him, all watching the TV._
    
     **Toffee:**[_v.o_]...as a distinguished senior citizen was savagely 
             attacked by Frasier Crane, Bird of Prey.
    **Frasier:** I can't watch any more of this.
     **Martin:** Well, that makes us even.  I can't hear any of it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you weren't hurt that badly!  Of course, you wouldn't 
             know that to listen to Toffee.  She makes the whole thing 
             sound like a disaster!
     **Daphne:** I know. [_brightens_] But did you see the way she could smile 
             right after?
    
    _Frasier glares at Daphne, and she rushes away._
    
    **Frasier:**[_sitting on couch_] Lord, this entire affair's turned into a 
             PR nightmare!
     **Martin:** Well, it's your own fault for hiring Howdy Doody as your 
             agent!
    
    _Doorbell._
    
    **Frasier:**[_walking to door_] Dad, I'm sorry.  Ben had no idea that bird 
             was going to attack you.  Besides, there is a school of 
             thought that says there's no such thing as bad publicity.
    
    _Frasier opens door. Niles enters, laughing wickedly._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I was just hearing about you on the car radio.  The 
             deejay was offering a cash prize for the best Frasier Crane 
             joke.  Wait, what was the front-runner?  Oh, yes, how can you 
             tell Frasier the Crane's a psychiatrist?
    **Frasier:**[_closing door_] I can't wait to hear.
      **Niles:** He ignores what you say then sticks you with a large bill.
    
    _Laughs all around, except Frasier._
    
      **Niles:**[_walking toward Martin's chair as Frasier goes to his 
             bookshelves_] You must excuse my jolly mood, but Maris 
             was over tonight for our weekly conjugal visit.
     **Martin:**[_clearly disgusted_] Eeww, Jeez.
      **Niles:** I've never seen her look so seductive.  She wore a clingy 
             gown, crimson lipstick, even earrings, which she tends to 
             avoid as they make her head droop.  She pulled me down upon 
             the bed and began playing my spine like a zither.  And then, 
             just as things were heating up, she renewed her request that 
             I dismiss Doctor Wilphaum.  So tremulous with desire was I 
             that I almost relented, but then I remembered your advice, 
             Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire the good doctor - at which 
             point Maris told me I wouldn't be firing anything else in 
             the foreseeable future!!  And she left!
    **Frasier:** Now, now, now, Niles, withholding sex may be just as difficult 
             on Maris!  She may crumble first!
      **Niles:** Are you serious?  One hour of passion can sustain her for 
             months.  She stores it up like some sexual camel.
    **Frasier:**[_defensive_] All right, Niles.  You know that my advice was 
             solid.
      **Niles:** I hope you're right. [_phone rings_] I'll get it.  Hello?  
             Oh, hello Roz. [_to Frasier_] It's Roz.
    **Frasier:** Thank you. [_takes phone_] Roz, hello.  Yes, what is it?
      **Niles:**[_pointing at flowers on table_] That's a striking arrangement.
     **Martin:** It's from Bebe.  After what happened today, she's trying to 
             woo him back.
      **Niles:** Birds of Paradise, I suppose that's her idea of floral irony.
    **Frasier:**[_on phone_] Yes, well, ah, thanks for the warning, Roz.
     **Martin:** What's that about?
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, it turns out the station manager won't be 
             renegotiating the contracts himself.  Apparently he's brought 
             in one of these hired guns stations use to reduce costs. 
             Some fellow nicknamed "The Hammer."
      **Niles:**[_examining flowers_] I'm assuming they call him "The Hammer"
             because he's tough.
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, because he loves the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein!
     **Martin:** You know, Frasier, if I were you, I'd give Bebe a call.  
             Now, I'm no fan of hers, either, but this is a pretty big 
             negotiation.
    
    _Doorbell._
    
    **Frasier:**[_walks toward door_] No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben. 
             Oh, sure, maybe Bebe could use her dark arts to get me a 
             dollar or two more, but, you know, my integrity is worth 
             more than that. [_opens door_] Hello, Ben.
        **Ben:** Hey, big guy.  How ya doing?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, fine.
        **Ben:** Good.  Boy, people sure are being mean about this!  I was 
             just listening to the radio on the way over.  Ouch.  But I 
             always say, if life hands you a lemon, make lemonade.
    **Frasier:** That's the spirit. [_hopefully_] So you've got some sort of
             damage-control plan?
        **Ben:** You betcha.  I got a way to turn this whole mess around and 
             show that station manager just what you're made of.
    **Frasier:** Excellent!  But you won't be dealing with him.  You'll be 
             dealing with this free-lancer they call "The Hammer."
        **Ben:** Hoo-boy. [_sits_]
     **Martin:** You've gone up against him?
        **Ben:** Oh yes, and I had to take a pretty firm line with him.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad to hear that.
        **Ben:** Yeah, I finally said, "You better just clean up your language, 
             Pal.  I walked out on that Mamet play, I can walk out on you."
    **Frasier:**[_hesitates_] So, uh, about your plan.
        **Ben:** Yeah, right! Um, I think there's a way to show people you're 
             laughing right along with them.  You do a photo op where you, 
             Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist, give the crane therapy. 
             You know, you sit in a chair with a pad on your lap, and the 
             crane - properly sedated, of course - sits on... [_pulls 
             out a miniature psychiatrist's couch_] THIS.
    
    _Skeptical looks exchanged._
    
      **Niles:** Where on earth did you find a couch that size?
        **Ben:** Oh, I built it myself.  I have a little workshop in my attic 
             where I make toys for the neighborhood kids.
     **Martin:** Look at you!  Agent, samaritan... elf.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I like this idea!  It's droll... and self-mocking.  It's 
             the perfect way to turn a PR embarrassment into a triumph!
        **Ben:** Great.  I'll set up the photo op.  And don't you be nervous 
             about The Hammer, all right?  Because I can be a pretty tough
             customer myself!
    **Frasier:**[_walking him to the door_] I'm sure you can!  I know you're 
             gonna go in there and you're gonna give him hell!
        **Ben:** Boy, I love show business, but I'll never get used to the 
             cursing!
    
    _Ben opens door and leaves.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **MAYBE IT WAS A DISGRUNTLED FORMER ZOO WORKER**
    
    _Scene Two - Int. Caf e Nervosa
    Frasier walks toward and sits at Niles's table.  He has a large white 
    bandage on his forehead.  Waitress approaches.
    _
     **Frasier:**[_quietly_] Latte, please.
    **Waitress:** Hey, didn't I see your picture in the paper today?  There 
              was a big bird chasing you around a little couch!
     **Frasier:**[_glares_] Latte, please.
    
    _Waitress leaves._
    
      **Niles:** Well, I think you have a real case against the maker of 
             those crane sedatives.
    **Frasier:** Thank you for the sympathy!
      **Niles:** You're not the only one going through a rough patch.  Maris 
             has strained my libido to the breaking point!
    **Frasier:** Niles, you can't give in!
      **Niles:** I'm getting desperate!  This morning, I found myself flirting 
             with my manicurist!
    **Frasier:** The one with the thing on her face?
      **Niles:** I told you, I'm desperate!
    **Frasier:** What can be keeping Ben?
      **Niles:** After all this, you're still using Ben?  Shouldn't you just 
             go back to Bebe?
    **Frasier:**[_points finger_] I see what you're doing.  You think if I bail 
             out on my principles it gives you an excuse to go crawling 
             back to Maris.  Well, I'm not going to do it.  Ben may have
             made some mistakes, but he is a good man, and he's going to 
             make me a good deal!
    
    _Gil has just entered the Cafe.  He's standing in the doorway in a 
    state of shock._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Gil!  How'd it go with the Hammer?
        **Gil:** You've never seen such cold, dead eyes!  It was like 
             bargaining with Nosferatu.  My salary's been slashed!
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry.
    
    _Waitress approaches._
    
    **Waitress:** Can I do anything else for you?
       **Niles:**[_holding up biscotti_] Yes, would you mind nibbling on this
              provocatively?
     **Frasier:** Niles! [_to waitress_] We're fine, thank you. [_waitress leaves_]
         **Gil:** I wish you good luck, Frasier.  I don't see anybody squeezing 
              blood from that stone.
    
    _Bebe and Roz enter, both waving their hands in the air._
    
       **Bebe:**[_triumphantly_] Lattes for everyone!
        **Gil:**[_shocked_] Dear God, don't tell me you did well!
        **Roz:**[_thrilled_] I got a weekly spot on Clint Weber's show and a 
             thirty percent raise!
        **Gil:** How on earth did you get all that?
       **Bebe:**[_evil laugh_] Oh, we go way back, the Hammer and I.  I know 
             where the bodies are buried. [_pause_] Usually, that's just a 
             metaphor.
        **Roz:** So, Gil, what'll you have?  My treat?
        **Gil:** I think I'll be happier at the losers' table with Aunt Penny, 
             the story lady. [_calls offstage_] Penny!  Don't put that flask   
             away! [_moves off_]
    **Frasier:** Well, congratulations, Roz.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm 
             waiting for Ben.  We have to discuss our bargaining position.
       **Bebe:** Oh, there're so many to choose from.  Kneeling, crawling, 
             groveling.  I'm sure he'll pick the right one.
    
    _Bebe and Roz leave for the counter to order._
    
    **Frasier:**[_muttering_] God, she is obnoxious!
      **Niles:**[_watches her_] Mmmm.  Though alluring, in a buxom, bad-girl 
             kind of way.
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up, you horny idiot! [_pause_] My bandage seems a 
             little loose. If Ben gets here, just tell him I went in to 
             fix it. [_leaves for bathroom_]
    
    _Bebe watches Frasier go toward restroom.
    
    CUT TO:
    Int. restroom
    Frasier enters and closes the door. He walks to the mirror to examine 
    his bandage.  Bebe opens the door and enters right behind him._
    
       **Bebe:** Frasier, we have to talk.
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] Are you aware that you are in the men's room?
       **Bebe:** Oh, please, if I paid attention to signs with little pictures 
             on them... I'd never get a parking space. [_closes door_] Now, 
             it's time we both dropped the masks.  You need me, and I want 
             you back.  Just sign this contract. I'll cut you a deal 
             that'll make Roz's look like lunch money.
    **Frasier:** Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere you should be hovering 
             over?
       **Bebe:** You wanna see a carcass, chum? [_grabs Frasier and faces him 
             toward mirror_] Look in the mirror.  Look what you've let that 
             man do to you.  Your face is riddled with bird bites, your 
             name's a punchline, and your career is five minutes from 
             over, and he's only been your agent for three days!
    
    _We see Frasier in the mirror.  He holds a hand up to his mouth, 
    looking horrified at "what he has become."_
    
       **Bebe:** Send him in against the Hammer and you'll be doing fog reports 
             from a lighthouse in Puget Sound! [_turns him around toward her 
             almost violently_] Admit it!  You're scared!
    **Frasier:**[_desperately_] All right, maybe I am scared!  But... there is 
             one thing that is stronger than fear!  Faith!  Faith that a 
             good man with a good heart can make a good deal! [_pushes her 
             back_] Now get out of my way!
       **Bebe:** No, I won't let you!  D'you know what I've been through 
             building your career?  I have been to hell and back so often 
             I have frequent flier miles! [_runs to him, grabs the lapels 
             of his coat and pulls him toward her_] You owe me a second 
             chance!
    **Frasier:** Take your tentacles off of me! [_shoves her away, rushes out_]
       **Bebe:**[_calling after him_] Please! I won't be the same Bebe you 
             knew!  I'll change!  I'll be like Ben! [_pause_] Only competent! 
    _At the table, Roz is nibbling on Niles's biscotti.  He has his hand 
    on her shoulder and is holding the plate up to catch crumbs.  He's 
    watching with a dazed, dreamy look on his face.  He looks up when he 
    sees Frasier and Bebe emerge from the men's room._
    
       **Bebe:**[_chasing Frasier_] Darling, you forgot to sign!
      **Niles:**[_starting to stand_] Oh, you reconciled.  Congratulations, 
             I'll just be off to Maris's.
    **Frasier:** Sit down, Niles! I'm still with Ben.
    
    _Ben enters in a black trench coat._
    
    **Frasier:** Ben!
        **Ben:** Sorry I'm late.  I took my son's troop on a nature hike and 
             little Noah got a bee sting, so I rushed him to the emergency 
             room, then I came straight here.
    **Frasier:** It's all right, we've got five minutes.
        **Ben:** Excuse me. [_leaves_]
        **Roz:** Now, Frasier, you know Bebe can make you a better deal.
      **Niles:** Listen to Roz.
       **Bebe:** Listen to Niles.
    **Frasier:** I'm not listening to any of you!  My God, am I the last man 
             on God's green earth that's still willing to stand up for a 
             principle?
    
    _Ben comes back sans trench coat.  He is wearing a boy scout uniform, 
    complete with shorts and red tie/sash._
    
        **Ben:** Should we go over those demands for ol' Mr. Hammer?
    _There is a long pause.  Frasier looks very regretful.  Before he even 
    begins speaking, Niles takes out his cell phone and dials._
    
    **Frasier:**[_hesitantly_] Ben, could we have a word?
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] Hello, Maris!
    
    _Ben and Frasier go to corner booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Uh, listen, I don't think it's news to you that things haven't 
             been going so smoothly with us, and I think I'd feel more 
             comfortable with Bebe.  I know this must seem a bit of a shock 
             to you, but, ah-
        **Ben:**[_laugh_] No, I saw this coming.  Yesterday, when you threw that 
             little couch at me, I thought to myself, "This is not a happy 
             client."
    **Frasier:** Thanks for understanding.
    _Frasier and Ben stand, Ben leaves to get his coat, Frasier walks over 
    to where Bebe is standing beside the counter and Roz is sitting at the
    closest table.  Niles has just closed his cell phone and is now rushing 
    out the door._
    
      **Niles:**[_o.s_] Taxi!
    
    _Frasier goes to stand by Bebe at the counter._
    
       **Bebe:**[_handing over paper and pen; almost affectionately_] Sign 
             right here, darling.
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm holding you to that promise about changing.  
             I won't stand for any more shady doings.
       **Bebe:**[_almost sincerely_] Those days are all behind me.
    **Frasier:** Once you've worked out this thing with the Hammer, maybe you 
             can see what you can do about defusing this bird situation.
    
    _Ben walks back over with his trench coat._
    
        **Ben:** Oh, you don't have to worry about the crane anymore.  The 
             poor thing choked to death this morning.  They have no idea
             who would feed a bird a jawbreaker.  Bye, now. 
    
    _Ben leaves.  Frasier turns slowly to Bebe._
    **Frasier:**[_hopefully and fearfully at once_] Is there any chance it 
             wasn't you?
       **Bebe:** Oh, darling... [_looks around, trying to come up with an answer 
             he'll be satisfied with_] There's always a chance.
    **Frasier:**[_ponders_] I can live with that. [_signs papers_]
    _FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier walks into his apartment to see Daphne, holding a pad wearing 
    dark, Sigmund Freud-ish glasses, sitting on the coffee table beside 
    Eddie, who is lying on the little toy couch, also on the coffee table.  
    She puts a finger to her lips, gesturing for Frasier to be quiet.  She 
    writes on the pad.  Frasier goes to his bookcase, gets a book, walks 
    over, and hits Daphne in the head.  She laughs as he walks away.
