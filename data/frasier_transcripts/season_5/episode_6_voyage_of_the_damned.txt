    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is doing his show.
    _
    **Frasier:** Well, Karl, I guess you've got two choices.  Either you have 
             the tattoo removed, or you travel the globe searching for 
             another soul mate named Fredwina.  We'll be right back after 
             this.
    _He goes to commercial.  Roz comes in with a travel brochure._
        **Roz:** Hey, I was just looking over this offer you got from the 
             Siren Cruise Line.  They want to know if--
    **Frasier:** Roz, you know my policy on commercial endorsements.
        **Roz:** Just listen.  One of their celebrity entertainers cancelled 
             on a ship that's going to Alaska, and they'll let us both go 
             for free if you'll fill in, and all you have to do is give a 
             brief lecture--
    **Frasier:** Roz, I'm a psychiatrist, not a huckster! There are still 
             some of us in this profession who believe in--[_sees brochure_] 
             mahogany wainscoting?
        **Roz:** Isn't that fabulous?  And just look at those staterooms!
    **Frasier:** Wow...
        **Roz:** Not to mention the gourmet chefs, the world-class health 
             spa...
    **Frasier:** Well, it does sound awfully tempting, Roz, but I just don't 
             think it's right to trade on one's good name for a free 
             trip.
        **Roz:** Well, plenty of people do.  Look, Zubin Mehta did one, 
             General Schwartzkopf, and it says right here, Gore Vidal did 
             two of them!
    **Frasier:** Gore Vidal?  He hates everything!
        **Roz:** But, if you feel it would tarnish your image, I'll just call 
             Vicki and tell her you said no.
    _She goes into her booth.  Frasier, sensing an opening, grabs at it._
    **Frasier:** Vicki?  Who's Vicki?
        **Roz:** Oh, she books the celebrities.  We met once at a party a 
             long time ago, I'm surprised she remembered me.  Frasier, 
             we're on in ten seconds.
    **Frasier:** Now, just hold on a minute, Roz, you didn't tell me this was 
             a favor for a close friend.
        **Roz:** She's not a close friend.
    **Frasier:** No, Roz, obviously this woman means something to you.  It's 
             certainly an awkward position you've put me in.
        **Roz:** Frasier, I don't care.
    **Frasier:** All right, I'll go!  But it's the last time I pull your 
             chestnuts out of the fire!
    _He goes back into his booth.
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's afternoon, and pouring rain outside.  Frasier sits at the piano, 
    playing idly.  Daphne comes out in her bathrobe.
    _
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Daphne.  Little late in the day, isn't it?
     **Daphne:** I just love days like this... nowhere to go, nothing to do... 
             though I have this sneaking suspicion I've forgotten 
             something.
    **Frasier:** Like getting dressed?
     **Daphne:**[_goes to the window_] Oh, I could watch the rain for hours.  
             Of course, when I was a little girl, I hated the rain.  
             Stuck inside, couldn't go out and play.  But my mum always 
             said, "enjoy it while you can, there'll be no water in 
             hell."  Of course, that was her answer for everything.  "Eat 
             your veggies, there'll be no Brussels sprouts in hell... 
             have a lie-down, there'll be no naps in hell..."
    **Frasier:** Daphne, you know I am a therapist, if you'd like to talk 
             about this sometime.
     **Daphne:** About what?
    **Frasier:** Nothing.
     **Daphne:** I wish I could remember what it is I forgot to do.  Oh well, 
             you know what they say -- if you can't remember, it probably 
             wasn't important anyway.
    _Martin stomps through the door, soaking wet and steaming mad._
    **Frasier:** Dad!
     **Daphne:** Oh no!
    **Frasier:** You are dripping!
     **Martin:** Yeah, that's what'll happen when you're standing out on the 
             corner waiting for your ride!
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, I am so sorry!
     **Martin:** What the hell were you thinking?!
    **Frasier:** Venting these emotions is all well and good, Dad, but I just 
             had these floors waxed!
    _He takes Martin's coat, hands him a towel and rushes to lay down 
    newspaper._
     **Martin:** I said four o'clock on the corner of Second and Bell.
     **Daphne:** Well, you should have called me!
     **Martin:** Well, I was afraid if I went looking for a phone I'd miss 
             you!
    **Frasier:** Good point, Dad.  Now, could you just step on that, please? 
             [_Eddie comes in_] Oh God, he's wet too!
    _Eddie starts shaking off._
    **Frasier:** No, no!  Damn him!  Daphne, help me get this canine 
             sprinkler out of here!
     **Daphne:** Oh now, don't be too cross with him, Dr. Crane!  As my mum 
             used to say, there'll be no dogs in hell!
    **Frasier:** I sincerely doubt that!
    _Daphne takes Eddie to Martin's room.  The doorbell rings, and Frasier 
    opens the door to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I just stopped by to return your cookbook [_hands it 
             over_], I won't be needing it after all.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  I thought you were preparing an anniversary 
             dinner for Maris.
      **Niles:** Uh, not this year.  Maris has flown to Switzerland for a new 
             cosmetic treatment.  Only one man performs the procedure, 
             and Maris wants to see him before he's extradited.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, I'm so sorry.
      **Niles:** It's so depressing.  Every time it looks as though we're 
             approaching a breakthrough in our therapy, Maris runs off 
             somewhere.  I really hoped spending time together on our 
             anniversary would get us over the hump.
    **Frasier:** Take heart, Niles, I know how frustrating it can be when 
             someone puts their own selfishness ahead of your personal 
             needs. [_steers Niles onto the newspaper_]
     **Martin:** Niles, why don't you take off that wet coat and stay for 
             dinner.  I'll get us started with a couple of nice hot 
             toddies, just like we used to make down at Duke's.
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, there's a recipe in this book for a hot 
             toddy.  It calls for courvoisier, chamomile tea, and a dash 
             of framboise!
     **Martin:** Garnish it with a few rose petals and that's just how Duke 
             used to serve it.
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] Make yourself comfortable.
    _In the kitchen, Martin pours water into three mugs and puts them in 
    the microwave.  Frasier comes in._
    **Frasier:** Poor Niles.  You know, Dad, maybe I should--
     **Martin:** Ah, ah!  Stop right there, I know what you're going to say.  
             You want to call Maris and talk her into spending her 
             anniversary with Niles.
    **Frasier:** I didn't realize I'd gotten as predictable as all that.
     **Martin:** Well, you have, and if you ask me--
    **Frasier:** Stop right there.  I know exactly what you're going to say.  
             You're going to say I should mind my own business and keep 
             my big bazoo shut!
     **Martin:** I was gonna say "fat yap," but you're in the ballpark.
    **Frasier:** Well, I just think that when two people are having problems, 
             their emotions can get the better of them.  A third party 
             can provide some perspective.
     **Martin:** They already have a therapist!  And if Niles needs any more 
             help, he's got Dr. Jim Beam and he makes house calls!
    _Martin pours bourbon into the mugs and gives two to Frasier.  In the 
    living room, Niles is talking on his cell phone._
      **Niles:** I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Maris.  I hope you 
             enjoy your trip to Switzerland.  Actually, I have plans of 
             my own for our anniversary that I'm very excited about.  
             Mmm-hmm.  Bon voyage. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Well, that's a very healthy approach, Niles.  What are your 
             plans?
      **Niles:** Well, I thought I'd sit alone in my cavernous apartment 
             while rocking back and forth while hugging my knees.
     **Martin:** Now, Niles, you're not going to be alone on your 
             anniversary, you'll have me and Fras.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, Dad, I've agreed to give a lecture on a 
             cruise that's going to Alaska... but I don't see any reason 
             why you two shouldn't join me, why don't you?
     **Martin:** Oh, that'd be great!  Wouldn't it, Niles?
      **Niles:** Uh, I don't know.
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, Niles, it'll help get your mind off your 
             troubles.
      **Niles:** I appreciate your concern, but whisking me off on a cruise?  
             I'm not as emotionally fragile as all that.
    **Frasier:** As you wish.  Well, Dad, I guess it'll be just you and me 
             then.
     **Martin:** Yeah!  When do we leave?
    **Frasier:** Fourteenth.
      **Niles:**[_breaking down_] The fourteenth?
    _Frasier holds him as Niles cries against his shoulder._
    **SHIP OF FOOLS**
    _Scene Three -- Ship Hallway
    
    Niles and Martin are walking through the hallway. Martin is imitating a 
    ship foghorn.
    _
     **Martin:**[_Makes the fog horn sound twice_]
      **Niles:** You know, that just gets funnier and funnier each time you do it.
     **Martin:**[_Makes the fog horn sound once_]
      **Niles:** No, no I'm wrong
    _Niles and Martin exit while Frasier and Roz emerge from their staterooms 
    at the same time._
        **Roz:** Hey, some ship, huh?  How's your stateroom?
    **Frasier:** I'd hardly call it a "stateroom."  Wouldn't even call it a 
             room, but I don't know the nautical term for "broom closet 
             with sconces."  How's yours?
        **Roz:**[_shuts her door behind her_] The same.  Worse, even.  I'm 
             sure you have a better view from your porthole than I do.
    **Frasier:** You have a porthole?!
        **Roz:** What's the difference?  A cabin's just a place to shower and 
             change your clothes.
    **Frasier:** You have a shower?!  All I have is a nozzle and a floor 
             drain, it took me an hour before I put those two things 
             together!
    _Roz leads him down the hall.
    
    Scene Four - Cocktail Lounge
    Martin and Niles are sitting at the bar._
    **Martin:** Now the buffets come at a pretty good clip, so you got to 
            pace yourself.  And watch out for your fillers--your breads, 
            your rolls, your chips and dip.  You've only got so much 
            room, don't be a hero.
    _Frasier and Roz enter._
        **Roz:** Hey, guys!
     **Martin:** Hey!  Hey, Fras, this is great!  You got one of those 
             bedrooms where the bathroom turns into a shower?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad. [_to Niles_] And before you say anything, I had no 
             idea what Spartan conditions we were in for.
      **Niles:** It's quite all right.  Once I got over my fear that I'd be 
             hauled below deck and manacled to another oarsman, I 
             actually started to enjoy myself.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I guess I won't be spending that much time 
             in my cabin anyway.  I'll be hobnobbing with my fellow 
             celebrities.
     **Martin:** Yeah, they got a lot of big names on board.  Did you see the 
             pictures?
    _He points to a stand against the wall with a group of portraits._
        **Roz:**[_reading_] "Live and in Person: Radio star Dr. Frasier 
             Crane!"  How about that?
    **Frasier:** Lord, I don't know if I really care for the word "star," 
             considering the caliber of the other people on board.
      **Niles:**[_looking closer_] "The Comedy Stylings of Giggles O'Shea."  
             Oh yes, you're in stellar company.  Oh, and look, they even 
             managed to snare a magician--"The Amazing Lance Gould."
     **Martin:** Oh, he's great!  I caught his act in Reno a few years ago.  
             For his finale, he made his own head disappear!
      **Niles:** Now, did the toupee go too, or did it just hover over the 
             collar?
    **Frasier:** Dear God!  You've booked me on a floating Gong Show!  What 
             happened to Zubin Mehta and Gore Vidal?
        **Roz:** I am so sorry, Frasier, I had no idea.  I guess they just 
             booked all their A-list celebrities on the big ships.
    **Steward:**[_on P.A._] Your attention, please.  The "Taste of Alaska" 
             buffet is no being served on the Lido deck.
     **Martin:** Ooh, that's my cue!  You guys coming?
      **Niles:** Uh, Dad, we had a big lunch at home.
     **Martin:** Rookie mistake.  See you at dinner.
    _He limps out of the lounge._
        **Roz:** Look, Frasier, it's not that bad.  I mean, at least you got 
             top billing.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course I got top billing!  I'm the only one up 
             there I've ever heard of!
        **Roz:** Come on, what about him?
    **Frasier:** "Latin Singing Sensation Carlos 'the Barracuda' DelGato?"
        **Roz:** Yeah!  Don't you remember him from the 70's?  He invented 
             that big dance craze, the Barracuda.
      **Niles:** Believe it or not, Maris was a big fan of his.
    **Frasier:** No!
      **Niles:** Yes, that was the one dance she could do.  The Hustle was 
             too strenuous -- she had no booty to shake.  But her fetching 
             little under-bite was just perfect for the Barracuda.
    _Niles sticks out his jaw and snaps his teeth in remembrance.  Frasier 
    notices a well-dressed blond woman staring from across the lounge._
    **Frasier:** Niles, why is that woman staring at you?
    _Niles turns, looks --and snaps back.
    _
    **Niles:** God help me!  It's that awful Mimi Cosgrove from the country 
           club!  Hide me!  She's a man-eating lush who'd go to any 
           lengths to--
     **Mimi:**[_coming over_] Niles?
    **Niles:** Mimi!  You funny little good-for-nothing Mimi! [_kisses her 
           cheeks_] What are you doing here?
     **Mimi:** Oh, just looking for the bar... oh, there it is! [_grabs his 
           arm_] Let me buy you a cocktail.
    **Niles:** Well, actually, I--
     **Mimi:** I don't know what it is about being on the water that makes me 
           so thirsty!  Ooh, have you been working out?
    _She drags him to a table.  He turns to Frasier and Roz and mouths, 
    "Help Me!"  A swarthy Latin man in Toreador pants comes in._
        **Roz:** Look, there he is, the Barracuda!
    **Frasier:** How thrilling!  A fellow headliner on the _U.S.S. Has-Been_!
        **Roz:** Oh, shut up!
    **Frasier:** Come on, Roz, let's go over my notes for my lecture.
    _Before they can exit, the Barracuda comes over._
    **Barracuda:** Dr. Frasier Crane?  I am Carlos DelGato. 
      **Frasier:**[_shakes his hand_] Ah, hello.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  
               Oh, this is Roz Doyle.
    _Roz extends her hand.  The Barracuda snaps it up and starts kissing 
    it._
    **Barracuda:**_Buenos noches.  Habla espanol?_
          **Roz:** Uh, not really.
    **Barracuda:** Is no matter.  I am sure you are schooled in the... 
               international language.
      **Frasier:** Oh yes, Roz, say something amusing in Esperanto!
    **Barracuda:**[_nasal laugh_] You know, each night, I select the most 
               beautiful woman in my audience and present to her a red 
               rose.  That means the evening has just begun.  Perhaps one 
               night, _chou_ will be... my _especial_ lady?  Until 
               then...
    _He sticks out his jaw and snaps his teeth.  Roz gasps.  He struts 
    off._
    **Roz:** O.K., you're right.  We're on the Voyage of the Damned.
    _Niles and Mimi sit at a table.  As they talk, he's constantly pushing 
    her hand off his wrist, his thigh, etc._
     **Mimi:** So, are you still separated?
    **Niles:** Uh, I'm afraid so.
     **Mimi:** Oh, you poor thing.
    **Niles:** Well, we're trying actually -- couples' therapy.
     **Mimi:** Oh, good!  You know I've always thought the world of you and, 
           uh...
    **Niles:** Maris.
     **Mimi:** Yeah, an angel!  Anyway, if there's ever anything I can do to 
           be of comfort to you, [_leans over and nibbles his ear_] you 
           just let me know.  Ooh, what is that marvelous fragrance?
    **Niles:** Well, that's uh--
    _A waiter comes over with a glass of champagne._
    Waiter: Excuse me, sir, but the lady wanted to send you this, with 
            her compliments.
     **Niles:** What lady?
    Waiter: Over there, in the black dress and the veil?
     **Niles:** Maris!
    Waiter: Oh, and there was one more thing.
     **Niles:** Yes?
    _The waiter tosses the champagne in Niles's face.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Five -- Lounge
    _
    Waiter: I'm really very sorry, sir, but she gave me the biggest tip 
            I've ever seen.
    _He gives Niles a napkin.  Mimi gets up._
    **Mimi:** I'm sure you can convince Maris that this is all completely 
          innocent--if not, I'm in Cabin 712.
    _Mimi leaves the lounge.  Frasier and Roz come running over._
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, what happened?  Was that Maris I saw running 
             out of here?
      **Niles:** Yes!  She saw Mimi pawing me and assumed the worst!  I've 
             got to go speak to her.  How upset did she look?
        **Roz:** Oh, I couldn't see anything past the outfit.  Who wears a 
             black dress and veil on a cruise?
    **Frasier:** Roz, the woman has virtually no pigmentation!  Three minutes 
             in the sun, she'd sear like an Ahi tuna!
      **Niles:** She's supposed to be in Switzerland!  What's she doing 
             here?!
    **Frasier:** Niles, I'm sorry.  This may be partly my fault.  You see, I 
             called Maris, told her how upset you were, and said it might 
             be fun if she could join us on the cruise.
      **Niles:** You invited her to come and didn't tell me?!
    **Frasier:** Well, I thought it would be a nice surprise!
      **Niles:** Oh, well it worked out perfectly!  She's probably on the 
             phone arranging to fly home from the next port. [_the waiter 
             comes by_] Excuse me, excuse me.  The lady who sent me the 
             champagne, do you happen to know which stateroom she's in?
     Waiter: No, sir.  But she did ask me to give you a message.
      **Niles:** Yes?
    _The waiter tosses another glass of champagne in Niles's face._
    **Niles:** Just out of curiosity, how much are these running her?
    _Scene Six -- Lounge
    Frasier sits at a table, preparing note cards for his speech.  Roz, 
    wearing a cocktail dress, comes from the bar with two drinks.
    _
        **Roz:** You're on in twenty minutes.  How's your speech coming?
    **Frasier:** It's hard to concentrate.  I'm so concerned about Niles.
        **Roz:**[_reads his first card and laughs_] I like this opening joke 
             you wrote, it's very funny.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckles_] Thank you.  I can't take all the credit, 
             actually.  I had a patty melt with Giggles before his show.
    _Niles comes back, disheveled and depressed._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.  I can't tell you again how sorry I am for 
             meddling.  How did it go with Maris?
      **Niles:** Terribly.  This is, without a doubt, the most depressing 
             night of my life.
    _Roz cracks up reading the next card.  Frasier sees it and laughs too._
        **Roz:** That is so funny-- I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** I spent hours looking for her, then I remembered her 
             fondness for the Barracuda.  I ran down to the lounge, and 
             found that Latin cheese ball crooning his ghastly song 
             directly to her!  I started to make my way over, then a 
             waiter came over, and by the time I got the champagne out of 
             my eyes, she'd disappeared into the crowd.  I waited for 
             her.  She never came out.  Neither did DelGato.
    **Frasier:** Niles, what are you implying?
      **Niles:** You know Maris's taste for revenge.  If she thinks I'm 
             having an affair with Mimi, then she's going to try and 
             punish me in kind.
        **Roz:** Wow... do you really think she's planning to "do the 
             Barracuda?"
    _She tries not to laugh.  Niles glares at her._
    **Frasier:** Niles, don't jump to conclusions, that's exactly what Maris 
             did.
      **Niles:** Says a lot about our marriage, doesn't it?  No trust on 
             either side, what hope is there for us?
    **Frasier:** Is there anything I can do?
      **Niles:** No, you've done enough.  I'm just going to take a walk.
    _He leaves the lounge._
    **Frasier:** Oh, I feel so guilty about this.  When will I learn to stop 
             interfering in other peoples' affairs?  I'd better go talk 
             to Maris, see if I can fix this.
        **Roz:** You're gonna butt in again?
    **Frasier:** I don't see what business that is of yours!
        **Roz:** Here comes your dad.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no!  Oh, no!  If he finds out, I'll never hear the end 
             of it!
    _Martin sits down at the table._
     **Martin:** Boy, that "Taste of Alaska" spread was a bust.  You want to 
             know what caribou meat tastes like?  Not chicken!  Where's 
             Niles?
    **Frasier:** He's out on a walk... oh, I may as well tell you everything!  
             Maris is on board.  She and Niles had a horrible fight, and 
             their marriage is in worse shape than it's ever been before, 
             and no need to tell you how she got here in the first place!
     **Martin:** I know, I know, what was I thinking, inviting her to come on 
             the cruise?
        **Roz:** You invited Maris?
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, Niles was so upset over being alone on his 
             anniversary, it just seemed like a good idea.  Smart, huh?  
             I give you all this guff about sticking your nose into other 
             people's business, then I turn around and do the same damn 
             thing.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, don't be too hard on yourself.
        **Roz:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right!  I invited Maris too.
     **Martin:** You did?  I thought I told you to keep your big bazoo shut!
    **Frasier:** Oh, you're one to talk!
     **Martin:** Well, so what do we do now?
    **Frasier:** Nothing!  Nothing at all!  Just let them work things out 
             themselves, and stay on the sidelines where we belong.
     **Martin:** All right. [_checks watch_] Ooh, better get going, we're gonna 
             miss the first seating for dinner!
    **Frasier:** But Dad, my lecture's in fifteen minutes.
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez.  All right, guess I can't do everything.  Tell me 
             how it went at the midnight buffet!
    _He limps out of the lounge.  Roz gets up._
        **Roz:** We'd better get going too.
    **Frasier:** Right.  First, I'm going to go talk to Maris.
        **Roz:** You just said--
    **Frasier:** Forget what I said!  You're coming too!
        **Roz:** Why do you need me?  I don't even know her.
    **Frasier:** You can vouch for Niles's innocence.
        **Roz:** Oh, all right.  I have to admit, I'm kind of curious to meet 
             her.  You know, in all these years, I've never actually seen 
             her face?
    **Frasier:** Well, I haven't seen her most recent one, so this'll be a 
             new experience for both of us.
    _Scene Seven -- Maris's Room
    Frasier and Roz stop in the hallway outside Maris's room.
    _
    **Frasier:** All right, now let me do all the talking--oh, and if it looks 
             like she has an orange Abyssinian on her head--_don't stare._  
             That's a wiglet.
    _A maid comes out of the room, notices them, and leaves the door open._
    Maid: All through.  Have a nice evening.
    _The maid leaves._
    **Frasier:** Damn!  She must not be here! [_Roz goes in_] Roz, what are you 
             doing, you can't go in there!
        **Roz:** I just want to see the room!
    _Frasier follows her into the room, which is spacious and lavishly 
    decorated._
    **Frasier:** You can't just barge into someone else's-- [_gasps_] My God, is 
             that a grand piano?!
    _Roz finds a red rose on the bureau._
        **Roz:** Frasier, look!
    **Frasier:** The Barracuda's calling card!  That means that he's chosen 
             Maris to be his...
    **Frasier/Roz:** "_Especial_ lady," eew!
    _Footsteps in the hall.  Frasier pushes Roz into the bathroom._
        **Roz:** Why are we hiding?  We came here to talk to her!
    **Frasier:** Because it's impossible to extol the virtues of trust to 
             someone whose room you've just broken into!
    _Someone comes through the door outside.  Frasier and Roz climb into 
    the shower and draw the curtain._
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!  The shower is bigger than my entire cabin!
        **Roz:** Shut up!
    _Martin comes into the bathroom.  Roz peeks through the curtain._
        **Roz:** Martin!
     **Martin:** Ahh!  What are you two doing here?!
    **Frasier:** We came to talk to Maris!  What are you doing here?!
     **Martin:** The same as you!
    **Frasier:** Well, then why did you come in the bathroom?!
     **Martin:** Well... what do you think?
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right, fine.
        **Roz:** Let's get the hell out of here.
    _They start towards the door, but hear someone else enter the room._
        **Roz:** It's Maris.
     **Martin:** Well, what's the big deal, why don't we just go in there and 
             talk to her?
        **Roz:** We can't go in there now, she might not be alone.  Remember 
             the rose?
    **Frasier:** Oh, God.
    _Roz kneels down and looks through the keyhole._
    **Roz:** I don't see her, maybe she went back out.  Oh, wait.  I see her 
         coat on a hat rack.
    _Martin and Frasier exchange a look._
    **Frasier:** Look closer.  Is the hat rack moving?
        **Roz:** Oh my God!
     **Martin:** What's she doing?
        **Roz:** Well, she seems to be alone.
    **Frasier:** That's good.
        **Roz:** Now she's pouring champagne -- two glasses.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's bad.
        **Roz:** Now she's putting on music.
    _A Latin Beat plays, with the words "Do-do-do the Barracuda..."_
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, that's bad.  On so many levels.
        **Roz:** She's coming this way!
    _Everyone crams into the shower, and they draw the curtain.  They 
    stand quietly as Maris [_seen only as a silhouette_] comes in, gargles, 
    spits, and goes out again.
    _
    **Frasier:** She's gone!
    _They stumble out of the shower again._
     **Martin:** How the hell are we going to get out of here?
    **Frasier:** I have no idea.  All I know is that I have got to be 
             downstairs in the next ten minutes, or two hundred people 
             are going to be sorely disappointed!
        **Roz:** Two hundred people?  Where'd you hear that?
    **Frasier:** They told me that was the room capacity! [_Roz just looks at 
             him_] Oh!  Oh, come on!  Giggles had to _add_ a show!
     **Martin:** Shh, she's gonna hear us.
    _Doorbell buzzes._
        **Roz:** It's the Barracuda!
     **Martin:** Who's the Barracuda?
        **Roz:** He's a sleazy Latin lounge singer Maris is going to sleep 
             with to get back at Niles for kissing Mimi!
     **Martin:** Who's Mimi?
    **Frasier:** A horny society boozer, and the Mrs. O'Leary's Cow of our 
             current predicament!
     **Martin:** Who's Mrs. O'Leary?
    **Frasier:** A woman in Chicago who -- oh, I don't have the time!  The point 
             is, we have got to stop this before Maris does something 
             that is going to damage her relationship forever.
        **Roz:** We cannot go out there.  We don't want to walk in on the two 
             of them.
     **Martin:** I don't want to see that!  I just ate caribou!
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right.  Seems I'm the only one who cares about this 
             relationship.  I will go and do it.
    _He opens the door -- and comes face-to-face with Niles.  Everyone jumps and 
    yells.
    _
      **Niles:** Maris, what a lovely bathroom!  Naaah! [_comes in and shuts 
             the door_] What are you doing here?!
    **Frasier:** We came to convince Maris that there was nothing going on 
             between you and Mimi!  What are you doing here?!
      **Niles:** Well, Maris and I ran into each other on deck, and we had a 
             long talk, and, well, she invited me back here for a glass 
             of champagne!
     **Martin:** Oh, that's great, Niles!
      **Niles:** Yes, though it might marr the mood a bit if she finds you 
             all spying on her! [_notices the sink_] Did you use that 
             mouthwash?
    **Frasier:** No, Maris did.
      **Niles:** My God -- she's in the mood for more than champagne!  You've 
             got to leave right now.  Just give me time to see her out to 
             the balcony.
    **Frasier:** A balcony?!
      **Niles:** Count to ten, and then scram, so Maris and I can celebrate 
             the way a man and his wife were meant to. [_cracks the door_] 
             Oh, damn.  She started without me.
    **Frasier/Martin/Roz:** Eeww...
      **Niles:** Drinking the champagne.
    **Frasier/Martin/Roz:** Ohhh...
    _Scene Z -- Hallway
    The Barracuda walks down the hallway, carrying a red rose in one 
    hand.  Stopping at Cabin 712, he checks the note written on his hand, 
    and rings the bell.  As he waits, he unbuttons the top of his shirt 
    to show more chest.
    
    Behind him, Frasier, Roz, and Martin slip out of Maris's room.  They 
    see Mimi open the door and usher the Barracuda in.  Frasier and Roz 
    tell Martin who the man and the woman are, and they all walk down the 
    hall laughing.
