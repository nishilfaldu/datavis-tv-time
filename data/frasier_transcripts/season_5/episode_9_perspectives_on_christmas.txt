    _ACT ONE_
    
    **A ROOM WITH FOUR VIEWS**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Bathroom
    The Bathroom is dark, lit only by candles.
    Martin is having a massage.  He tells his story._
    
     **Martin:** Ow!  Easy.
    **Masseur:** Sorry, your neck is tight.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, it's been a tense couple of days. 
    **Masseur:** The holidays'll do that to you.
     **Martin:** Yeah well, this has been the worst Christmas ever.  It all 
             started yesterday...
    _DISSOLVE TO: Frasier's Apartment.  Martin and Frasier are decorating 
    the tree by the balcony.  Niles is making a small decoration whilst 
    sipping his eggnog._
    
     **Martin:** You know the only part about Christmas I don't like?  How
             quickly it's all over!
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Come December 26th, it's all just a memory.  With 
             nothing but your light decorating touch to remind us.
    
    _Daphne enters the room with Eddie.  She watches the scene,
    unknowingly under the mistletoe._
    
     **Daphne:** Afternoon, all!
     **Martin:** Oh, hi Daphne!
      **Niles:** Oh!  That's awfully dangerous, Daphne, standing there under
             that mistletoe.
    **Frasier:** That's enough eggnog, Niles! [_takes his cup away_]
     **Daphne:** You know, the oddest thing just happened. [_Niles takes 
             Daphne's coat, sniffing the fragrances_] I was walking Eddie 
             past that church over on Chestnut.  And he turned to go 
             inside, like he assumed that was where we were going.
    **Frasier:** That's strange!  He did exactly the same thing with me
             yesterday when I was walking him.
     **Daphne:** Any idea why he would do that, Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** Look, that dog's always doing weird things!  Yesterday, when 
             we were taking our bath together, Eddie spent fifteen straight 
             minutes pushing the soap around with his nose like an otter.  
             It's weird! [_goes into the kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, if he gets any weirder, we'll have to send "Eddie" to a 
             home.
    _Frasier follows Martin into the kitchen.  Martin begins to pour
    himself some eggnog.  Niles and Daphne stay in the living room._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm off, I've got all my Christmas shopping to do yet.
     **Martin:** All of it?
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I'm determined not to settle this year.  I want my 
             gifts to be remembered and cherished long after the holidays.
     **Martin:** Well, you know, nothing is cherished quite so much as the gift 
             of laughter.
    **Frasier:** If you want that "Highway Patrol Bloopers" tape, you're gonna 
             have to buy it yourself! [_Martin starts to take a sip_] 
             Oh, Dad!  You're not going to drink that that way, are you?
     **Martin:** Why?
    _Frasier opens the cupboard and takes out some spices to enflavor 
    Martin's egg-nog._
    
    **Frasier:** My Goodness, the first mistake in eggnog preparation is 
             failing to garnish it properly with a dash of nutmeg.
             [_Frasier sprinkles some on_] There we are.
     **Martin:** Oh! 
    
    _Martin takes a sip and spits it out in a fit of coughing. 
    Frasier checks the jar._
    
    **Frasier:** Of course, the second mistake is placing the paprika next to 
             the nutmeg on the spice shelf. 
     **Daphne:**[_calls from the living room._] Mr. Crane, are you alright?
    **Frasier:** We're fine, Daphne!  You all right, Dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I'm fine.  Listen Frasier, before you go, can I talk 
             to you for a minute?
    **Frasier:** Well sure, what is it?
     **Martin:** Well, you know what Daphne was talking about?  There is a
             reason Eddie knows that church.  I've been taking him there.
    **Frasier:** I guess the family that bathes together prays together.
     **Martin:** Well, no.  But there's this priest, Father Curtis, he got to 
             know Eddie in the park and he asked if they could use him for 
             the Christmas pageant and I said sure.  Well, the next thing 
             I know, he's roped me in to play a shepherd.  Well then, 
             Dutch Gaansvort comes down with bronchitis and I get promoted 
             to a wise man...
    **Frasier:** Dad, is there a point to this story looming somewhere on the 
             horizon?
     **Martin:** As a wise man, I have to sing a song.  I said, well that was 
             fine, but this song's a killer.  I'm going to humiliate 
             myself!
    **Frasier:** Oh well, maybe you just need a little rehearsal.  Why don't 
             we work on it tonight?
     **Martin:** Really?  Do you think that would help?
    **Frasier:** Sure!  You're a good singer, you're just a little rusty.  
             Start around eight?
     **Martin:** OK.  Yeah, I am a good singer!  Remember those old family 
             picnics when I used to belt out "What's New, Pussycat"?
    **Frasier:** We'll start around seven, then. [_walks out_] 
             Niles, hold the elevator!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment
    Later, the Crane Boys are at the piano, when Martin enters holding
    his song book._
    
     **Martin:** Hey boys, this is that song I was telling you about, "Oh Holy 
             Night," do you know it?
    **Frasier:** Well, of course Dad, it's a classic.  My God, it all builds 
             up to that one glorious note.  "Oh night, [_high_] de-viiiine, 
             oh..."
     **Martin:** Yes, yes, that's the note I can't hit.  I practice in my room 
             and Eddie ends up burying his head under the pillow.
      **Niles:** Don't worry, Dad, we'll get you there.
     **Martin:** All right, can we just can this done?  I want to get it all 
             finished before Daphne gets back.  I don't want her to know
             anything about this or she'll insist on coming down to the
             pageant, and I'm nervous enough as it is.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
      **Niles:**[_sits at piano_] Let's just see what we have to work with.  
             Why don't you start here, "Oh night," and I want to hear you 
             really attack the note. [_plays_]
     **Martin:**[_singing:_] Oh night, 
                        When Christ was born.
                        Oh night di-viiiine!!
    
    _Martin sings di-viiiine badly and Eddie ends up burying his head
    under the pillow on the Armchair._
    
      **Niles:** Sometimes the note sees the attack coming and retreats!
    
    _The person in the upstairs apartment pounds through the ceiling._
    
     **Martin:** Shut up!  This bozo upstairs, he bangs on the floor every time 
             I start to sing.
    **Frasier:** Just ignore him, Dad.  I tell you what, there is another 
             vocal exercise I remember, it was very useful to me when 
             I was singing Colonel Fairfax in "Yeoman Of The Guard."  
             The principal is to distract yourself with a physical 
             exercise, thus freeing the voice.  You hit one note and 
             you slide up the octave as you descend slowly into a 
             crouched position.  Observe. 
    
    _Frasier does this._
    
    **Frasier:** You see?  It works.
      **Niles:** That's very interesting.  I wonder if the reverse is true.
    _So, he starts in a crouched position and slides down an octave as he 
    stands up.  The mad couple do this for a while, creating a strange 
    sight._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Try it, Dad.
     **Martin:** No, I'm afraid with three of us doing it, it might look 
             stupid.
      **Niles:** I'm starting to think your problem is all psychological.  
             No, no, no, I think you've convinced yourself you can't reach 
             the note...
     **Martin:** Yeah, I've convinced the guy upstairs too!
    **Frasier:** No, I think Niles may be right, Dad.  You just need some 
             positive reinforcement.  Let's try it again.  This time, 
             try to eliminate any negative thoughts.  Let's go again, 
             Niles, "Fall on your knees."
    _Martin sings the carol, whilst Niles & Frasier (through fixed smiles) 
    throw in some positive encouragement. 
    _
     **Martin:** "Fall on your knees..."
    **Frasier:** I hear sweet music!
     **Martin:** "Oh, hear the angels' voices..."
      **Niles:** I hear one angel!
     **Martin:** "Oh, night divine..."
    **Frasier:** Something's divine!
      **Niles:** Yeah, Dad!
     **Martin:** "Oh night, when Christ was born..."
    **Frasier:** A star is born!
     **Martin:** "Oh, night..."
    **Frasier:** Bring it home now!
    _But even that doesn't work and Martin fails again, cracking apart on 
    "divine" - causing Eddie to bury his head under the pillow and the 
    man above to bang on the ceiling again._
    
        **All:** Oh, shut up!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Bathroom
    Now it's Daphne's turn for the Masseur.  She begins her story._
    
    **Masseur:** Your shoulders are awfully tight.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, it's been a stressful few days.
    **Masseur:** I'd be happy to listen.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no... well, it started yesterday.  I had something on my 
             mind.  Lucky for me, Dr. Crane's brother was over.  He's 
             always been such a good friend to me...
    
    _DISSOLVE TO: replay of Scene One: the scene is set the same way as 
    before.  Martin and Frasier are decorating the tree by the balcony.  
    Niles is making a small decoration whilst sipping his eggnog.  
    Daphne enters the room with Eddie.  She watches the scene, unknowingly 
    under the mistletoe._
    
     **Daphne:** Afternoon, all!
     **Martin:** Oh, hi Daphne!
      **Niles:** Oh, that's awfully dangerous, Daphne, standing under that 
             mistletoe.  A piece could fall into your eye.
    **Frasier:** Let me freshen your drink, Niles! [_takes his cup away_]
     **Daphne:** Thank you, Dr. Crane.  The oddest thing just happened. [_Niles 
             takes Daphne's coat_] I was walking Eddie past that church over 
             on Chestnut, and he turned to go inside, like he assumed that 
             was where we were going.
    **Frasier:** That's strange!  He did exactly the same thing yesterday when 
             I was walking him.
     **Daphne:** Any idea why he would do that, Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** Nope! [_shrugs_] Dogs are weird!
    
    _Frasier and Martin enter the kitchen. Niles and Daphne stay in the
    living room and begin chatting._  
    
     **Daphne:** You know, that worries me a bit.
      **Niles:** What does?
     **Daphne:** Well, I think your father's been going to that church.  I had 
             an uncle who did the same thing.  He had no interest in church
             his whole life.  Then he started going everyday.  It turns out 
             he had some bad health news from his doctor.  He didn't even 
             last a year.
      **Niles:** Well, first of all, I can see you're upset, so come here.
             [_they hug_] 
     **Daphne:** Thank you, Dr. Crane, you're always so supportive!
      **Niles:** And second of all, I think you're worrying over nothing. 
             I've never known my father to have so much as a hangnail 
             without letting everyone know about it. 
     **Daphne:** That's true.  Maybe I just got myself worked up remembering 
             my Uncle John.
      **Niles:** Look at you, just saying his name gets you upset.  Come here.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm fine!
      **Niles:** No, no, you need a hug.
     **Daphne:** Oh, all right. 
    
    _As they hug, Martin coughs in the kitchen because of the eggnog._
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, are you alright?
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] We're... fine, Daphne.
      **Niles:** See, nothing to worry about.  Well, I have got to run.
    **Frasier:**[_coming out_] Oh, hold the elevator, Niles!  See you soon, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Bye!
    **Frasier:** And, uh, Dad? [_hurries to the door_] Listen, don't worry.  
             We'll... Niles and I will... be there for you. 
    
    _They leave.  Now Daphne is very worried.  Martin comes out._
    
     **Daphne:** What's that about?
     **Martin:** Oh, never mind!  Well, I gotta go lie down.
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane,  did you ever call Dr. Stuart, for the results of 
             your physical?
     **Martin:** Em, sure, couple of days ago.  
     **Daphne:** And?
     **Martin:** Em, fine.  Come on, Eddie. 
    
    _He pauses and looks at the tree._
    
     **Daphne:** Is everything all right?
     **Martin:** Oh yeah.  It's just all over so fast!
    
    _As he goes to his room, Daphne holds back the tears._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] Well, that was enough to convince me I was right.  
             And the next 24 hours were a living hell!  The worst came 
             the next day...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Apartment
    Martin is on the phone to the church about the pageant as Daphne
    enters with a shopping bag._
    
     **Martin:** Well, you know, I'm terrified about this, Father.  All this 
             came around so sudden.  I'm not prepared.  Now tell me again 
             what I'm supposed to say when I see Jesus the first time?  OK.
             All right.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, see you soon, bye. 
    
    _He puts the phone down.  Daphne holds back her tears again._
    
     **Martin:** Oh hi, Daphne!
     **Daphne:**[_brave smile_] Hello!  I'm just so excited about the gift I 
             just got for you, Mr. Crane.  
     **Martin:** Oh, great!
     **Daphne:** Why don't you open it now? 
             [_puts a parcel on the Armchair_]
     **Martin:** Oh, I'd love to, but to tell you the truth, I don't really 
             have much time, I'm kind of on my way out. [_Daphne begins to 
             cry_] Oh, OK, all right!  I'll open it now, sure, sure.  I 
             don't want to get you upset!  You must be really excited about 
             this! 
    
    _He pulls out an awful (but his style) sweater._ 
    
     **Martin:** Oh, wow!  It's that sweater!  The one I pointed out to you in 
             that window!  It's great!  Boy, I can die a happy man now! 
             [_Daphne bursts into tears_] Daphne, what's the matter, are you 
             all right?
     **Daphne:** Oh, Mr. Crane, I know why you've been going down to that 
             church!
     **Martin:** You do?  Well, you're not supposed to know about that!  
             But why is it making you so upset?
     **Daphne:** Because I care about you!  You were actually going to let this
             whole thing happen without ever telling a soul!
     **Martin:** Well, yes!  I-I don't want people staring at me in church, 
             stiff as a board, all that makeup on my face.
    
    _He goes to get his coat.  Daphne sinks onto the couch, weeping._
    
     **Daphne:** So... how much time have you got?
     **Martin:** Uh, about twenty minutes.
     **Daphne:**[_confused_] Twenty minutes?
     **Martin:** Yeah, and boy, will I be glad when it's all over.  This is the 
             last Christmas pageant I'm ever signing up for!
     **Daphne:** You're in a Christmas pageant?!
     **Martin:** Well, yeah!  What did you think I was talking about?
     **Daphne:** I thought you were dying!
     **Martin:** What?!
     **Daphne:** Well, you'd just got your test results back, you're down at 
             the church all the time. [_Martin laughs_] Why are you laughing?
     **Martin:** Well, it's funny!
     **Daphne:** I don't think it's so bloody funny!
     **Martin:** Are you kidding? [_acts as if hanged_] Oh, I'm dying!
     **Daphne:** You will be! [_hurls a pillow at him_]
     **Martin:** What are you doing?  Daphne, don't do that!
    _They argue for a while before starting to throw pillows at each other.  
    Meanwhile, Niles enters - his suit is a rag, his face is smeared and 
    he can hardly walk.  He collapses behind the sofa, which stops Martin's 
    and Daphne's argument. 
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Bathroom
    Daphne finishes her story, and Niles is now being massaged by the
    Masseur._
    **Masseur:** You can talk about it if you like.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm not ready just yet. [_falls asleep_]
    
    _End of Act One.  Time: (10:55)
    
    Act Two. 
    
    Scene Six - Bathroom
    Niles is lying on his back on the massage table._
      **Niles:** Oh, I can't tell you how good that feels.  I don't think I've
             ever had a massage like this before!
    _The camera pans up the table to show that Daphne is the Masseuse this 
    time, dressed in a short, white nurse's uniform and massaging his calf._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm glad.  As long as you're so relaxed, maybe I should 
             just give you your Christmas present right now.
    _Daphne climbs onto the table, lies on top of him and they kiss deeply. 
    Suddenly, Niles is woken up by the real Masseur._
    
      **Niles:** OW!  You woke me up!
    **Masseur:** Sorry, I guess this ankle's a bit tender.
      **Niles:** Well, yours would be too if you'd had the day I had...
    _DISSOLVE TO: the Elliot Bay Towers lobby: Niles is waiting for the 
    elevator._
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] I'd gone out to do some shopping, then I arrived at 
             Frasier's building.
    _The elevator doors open, he enters it.  There is an elderly husband 
    and wife there (Albert & Jane) and a woman about his age (Doris).  
    He squeezes in next to an inappropriate, extremely large Christmas 
    tree that takes up most of the car._ 
    
      **Niles:** Excuse me.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to crowd you.  This is a 
             brand-new, hand-tailored Italian suit.  You know how difficult 
             it is to get sap out of silk. 
     **Albert:** Another reason we didn't need this tree. 
       **Jane:** Oh, Albert!
    
    _The lift starts going up._
    
     **Albert:** This thing's a fire hazard.
      **Niles:** You know, they make a chemical now that you can use to 
             fireproof a tree.
     **Albert:** It causes cancer.
      **Niles:** Happy Holidays, then.
    
    _The elevator stops and everyone worries._
    
       **Jane:** What just happened?
      **Doris:** I think the elevator's stopped.
      **Niles:** Well, not to worry, I'm sure we'll get it going in a moment.
     **Albert:** We've probably got about twenty minutes of oxygen. 
      **Niles:** Sir, you're just going to alarm everyone.
      **Doris:** I work in an ER.
      **Niles:** Ah!  Well, perhaps you can instruct these people on the best 
             way to stay cool in a crisis.
      **Doris:** I was on duty that night the elevator cable snapped at the 
             Bing building.  And they brought those people in on cookie 
             sheets. 
    
    _Niles frantically pushes the help button._
    
        **Niles:** Hello, is anyone there?
    **Repairman:** Yeah, who is it?
        **Niles:** There's a group of us stuck in one of your elevators.  
               The doors won't open and we can't seem to move off the 
               8th floor.
    **Repairman:** All right, where are you calling from, sir?
        **Niles:** The Elliot Bay Towers.
    **Repairman:** Well, both my crews are out, it could be a good hour-and-
               a-half before I could get anybody there.
        **Doris:** But I can't wait that long, my children are alone upstairs 
               in the apartment!
       **Albert:** You haven't got a gas oven up there, have you?
    **Repairman:** Well, there is another way.  If somebody felt like climbing 
               through the trap door on top of your car, there's a manual 
               release switch up there that would open up your doors. 
        **Doris:** Well, that's what we've gotta do then, somebody's gotta go 
               up there. 
       **Albert:** Uhhh, that's a pretty small opening.
        **Niles:** Well obviously, I have more confidence in your wife than 
               you do. [_cups his hands toward Jane_] Step this way, ma'am, 
               I'll give you a leg up. [_Albert slaps his hands down_]
        **Doris:** It has to be you. 
        **Niles:** Well, uh, I'd have - how do you expect me to get up there?
        **Doris:** Well, you can climb up the tree. 
        **Niles:** Oh, come on.
        **Doris:** Well now, surely you climbed plenty of trees when you were 
               a boy.
         **Jane:** That's Dr. Crane's brother.
    **Albert/Doris:** Oh...
        **Niles:**[_purses his lips_] Fine.  I suppose in times of crisis, 
               someone must step forward and be a hero. 
    
    _He hands his coat to Doris and begins climbing the tree._ 
    
      **Niles:** Today that man is Niles Crane!  Tomorrow, it will be my dry 
             cleaner, Mr. Lee. 
    
    _Reaching the top of the tree, he pushes open the trap door._
    
     **Albert:** All right, come on now, grab his feet and we'll push him 
             through. [_everyone does_]
      **Niles:** No, no, wait, not so fast!
    
    _He disappears up through the trap door and lands with a thud._
    
      **Niles:**[_o.s._] No, not to worry, I landed in a nice, soft puddle of 
             grease.  I just have to find the release switch, bear with 
             me...
    
    _There is the sound of a lever being pulled.  The doors open._
    
      **Doris:** Quick!
    
    _They all run out into the hall, leaving Niles behind._
    
      **Niles:** Did that do anything?  People?  Lady with my coat? 
             [_sticks his head back down_]  Where'd you all go?
    
    _He gapes as the elevator doors slide shut again, blocking him from 
    the camera's view._
    
      **Niles:**[_from inside the shaft_] Oh my God!  We're going up!  Someone 
             stop this thing!
    _DISSOLVE TO: the 19th Floor.  The elevator doors open, and Niles and 
    the tree tumble into the hallway.  He crawls out, his suit in tatters 
    and covered in mud and grease._
      **Niles:**[_every inch agony_] Ow...
    
    _A couple walks past him._ 
    
    **Woman In Hall:** Why is that man crawling?
      **Man In Hall:** That's Dr. Crane's brother.
    **Woman In Hall:** Oh...
    
    _He stands up and rights himself, then enters the apartment.  
    He walks in on Martin and Daphne arguing, as before, but 
    with considerably more grace than in Daphne's recollection._
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] I was slightly shaken by what I had done, but I'd 
             completely composed myself as I arrived at Frasier's.  But 
             it was some time later that I was able to tell them what had 
             happened...
    
    _DISSOLVE TO: that night: Niles is sitting on the sofa with Daphne, 
    while Frasier watches._
    
      **Niles:** Of course, I have no idea what you use to get elevator grease 
             out of silk!
    **Frasier:** Well, brown suede seems to leaching it out nicely! [_doorbell 
             sounds_] Anyway, no Christmas is complete without a bit of 
             tumult.  But now we can all relax and enjoy a lovely holiday 
             evening together.
    
    _He opens the door to Roz, looking furious._
    
        **Roz:** Merry Christmas!
    _She throws a gift box onto the floor - inside, there is the sound of 
    glass breaking - and turns back to the elevator.  Frasier follows her 
    out.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Bathroom
    Roz is now on the massage table.  She tells her story._
    
        **Roz:** You sure you wanna hear about this?
    **Masseur:** Why not?
        **Roz:** OK.  Well, I've been feeling a little depressed lately, 
             because I've been putting on all this weight, I'm pregnant...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    Her story begins in Caf e Nervosa, where Niles, Frasier and Martin
    are having their usual rendezvous.  Roz enters and sits down._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, guys! [_they all greet her; to Niles_] That's a nice suit.
      **Niles:** Well, thank you.  It's brand new, and so since you'll probably 
             be ordering food, I think I'll just go, rather than risk 
             getting it stained.
        **Roz:** What is that supposed to be?  Some kind of crack about how
             much I eat? 
      **Niles:** Absolutely not, it was a crack about your table manners.
             [_leaves_]
     **Martin:** Well, I should go too.  I just got a couple of hours before
             the pageant and I need the time to rehearse. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, not to worry, Dad.  Come tomorrow, it'll all be a memory.
    
    _Daphne comes through the door, unnoticed by anybody._
    
     **Martin:** Yeah, but even after it's all over, I still have to make 
             peace with the man upstairs!
    
    _Daphne runs into the bathroom, crying.  When Martin leaves, 
    Roz starts her chat._ 
    
        **Roz:** So, Frasier, are you sure we have to do this charity thing 
             this afternoon?
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, Roz.  It's just an hour out of your life!
             Besides, I think you're gonna make an adorable Mrs. Claus.
        **Roz:** Why?  Because now I look so much like her, because I've 
             gotten so fat?!
    
    _Frasier's mobile rings.  He answers._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Why, yes, Mrs. Doyle, yes, she is.  Just a moment. 
             [_to Roz_] It's your mom, they forwarded her from the office.
        **Roz:**[_into phone:_] Hello, Mom?  Yes, I got your message.  Yep, 
             I'm picking you up at the airport, 10 AM.  Right, I'm looking 
             forward to seeing you, too.  Bye! 
    **Frasier:** Oh, wait, wait, let me say "Merry Christmas!"
        **Roz:** Hang on, Mom! 
    
    _She passes the phone to Frasier, and goes to the bar._
    
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Mrs. Doyle!  Yes, Frasier again.  Hi, happy 
             holidays! [_lowers voice_] Uh, listen, just a word to the wise: 
             Roz has put on quite a few pregnancy pounds of late, and she's 
             really sensitive about it.  So, you know, I would just say be 
             careful what you say to her, alright? [_Roz comes back_] Bye-
             bye, yes, we'll see you soon, bye!
        **Roz:**[_picks up her things_] You know, Frasier, I think I'll meet you 
             over there.  I still have a couple of gifts to get!
    **Frasier:** Oh, God!  I still have all of mine to get.  You know, no 
             matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to find anything 
             that seems quite right this year!
        **Roz:** Oh, it's really sweet how you're trying to make all your gifts 
             special.  I'm sorry I've been so cranky, I'm just nervous 
             about my mom coming.  I'm sort of just dreading the big 
             conversation where I finally tell her I'm pregnant.
    _About thirty seconds must pass before Frasier can speak, during which 
    he inanely pats her shoulder and smiles comfortingly._
    
    **Frasier:** You mean you haven't told her yet?
        **Roz:** No, it's just not the type of thing you blurt out over the 
             phone!
    
    _Frasier's smile widens.  His phone rings again._
    
        **Roz:** Well, I'll let you get that.  I'll see you over there.
    **Frasier:** Right. [_Roz leaves; he answers his phone_] Hello?  Yes, I had 
             a feeling you might call back!
    _DISSOLVE TO: Scene Eight - Shopping Mall
    Later, Frasier and Roz are Mr. & Mrs. Claus.  Frasier is already 
    dressed in full attire on his chair.  Roz enters dressed as Mrs. 
    Claus._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz!  There you are, I was beginning to worry about you.
        **Roz:** Well, you should have!  I am on the verge of a complete
             breakdown!  Shopping was a disaster!  And when I went to 
             slip into this darling little costume, my pants split.
    **Frasier:** Oh! 
        **Roz:** And on top of all that, I can't stop thinking about my mom!  
             How am I going to tell her?!
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, if you'd like, I could tell her for you.
        **Roz:** Are you kidding?!  She's gonna be mad enough that _I_ waited 
             three months to tell her, the only thing worse would be to 
             hear it from someone else!
    **Frasier:** Well, it's entirely possible she already knows.
        **Roz:** No way, the only person who knows she's spoken to is you- 
             _Oh my God!_  Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_welcoming first girl_] OK!  Ho-ho-ho, who's first?
    
    _The first girl, Sally, comes and sits on his lap._
    
        **Roz:** What is wrong with you?  I'm going to kill you!
      **Sally:** You're going to kill Santa?
    **Frasier:** No, little girl, Mrs. Claus just wants to _kiss_ me.
        **Roz:** Yeah, I'll kiss you.  Come 'ere, I'll kiss you good! 
             [_gives Sally a candy cane_] Here, run along! [_to Frasier_] 
             Are you insane?
    **Frasier:** Roz, you tell your mother everything, how was I supposed to 
             know?!
    
    _The next child, Billy, sits on his lap._
    
    **Frasier:** Ho-ho-ho.
      **Billy:** Hi Santa, I want a pony for Christmas.
        **Roz:** You got it, now beat it! 
      **Billy:**[_running off_] Mommy, Mommy, I'm gonna get a pony!
    **Frasier:** Can't we talk about this later?
        **Roz:** No, we can't!
    
    _Vic, a big kid, comes up._
    
        **Vic:** Hi, Santa.
        **Roz:** Oh My God!  What are you, twenty?  Get outta here! [_Vic 
             leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Roz, will you just try to stay calm?
        **Roz:** No, I will not stay calm!  Because I am not calm, I am 
             completely _freaked!_ [_slams her glasses to the ground_] 
             I am pregnant, and you told my crazy mother, and my 
             Christmas is ruined, and I'm too fat to even be Mrs. 
             Santa, and I hate this holiday! 
    
    _She runs out, kicking a bag of presents.  The mothers and children 
    look shocked._
    
    **Frasier:** Mrs. Claus was up very late last night. 
    _DISSOLVE TO: Scene Nine - Frasier's Apartment
    Roz is outside Frasier's door with a gift box, angrily stabbing the 
    doorbell._ 
    
        **Roz:**[_v.o._] Of course I still had to stop by Frasier's, I had to 
             give him his champagne glasses. 
    _Frasier answers the door, and Roz once again throws the present to
    the floor shouting "Merry Christmas!"  Frasier once again goes after
    her._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, don't go!  Come on, look, I'm sorry about what happened, 
             but it was a mistake, you can't stay mad at me.
        **Roz:** I still have to face my mother tomorrow!
    **Frasier:** Well, we can talk about that.  Come on in.  Please, come in? 
             [_caressing her belly_] Look, how would it look if I turned 
             a pregnant lady away on Christmas Eve when there's so much 
             room here at the inn?
    
    _Roz rolls her eyes, but allows Frasier to steer her back inside.  
    Daphne and Niles are sitting there moodily, Daphne with her head 
    resting on her arm, Niles still picking elevator grease from his 
    suit.  Frasier tries to cheer things up._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, Daphne, Roz is here!
    **Niles/Daphne:**[_bored_] Hi.
        **Roz:**[_imitating_] Hi.
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, people!  Let's liven things up a little, it's 
             Christmas Eve!  What are the Cranes known for if not their 
             legendary holiday spirit?
    
    _Martin enters in a storm, dressed as a wise man, with Eddie._
    
     **Martin:** I hate singing and I hate Christmas and I'm going to bed!
    **Frasier:** Dad, what happened?
     **Martin:** Well, I went into my song and everything was going fine.  
             Then we come up to the high note, and I actually think I'm 
             going to hit it for once.  Then I look over and I see Eddie.  
             He's got his head buried in the Christ Child's cradle!  Well, 
             I guess he mistook the Christ Child for one of his chew toys 
             because he grabs a hold of it inis teeth and starts shaking 
             it!  So, the Virgin Mary grabbed hold of its legs, well, you 
             know how Eddie likes a good tug-of-war, so they're going at 
             it, then Eddie runs out of there with it still in his mouth 
             and half the population of Bethlehem chasing after him!  
             I never should have agreed to be in that pageant!
     **Daphne:** You would have saved me a lot of grief!
     **Martin:** Oh, don't start this again!
      **Niles:** Don't you talk to her like that!
    **Frasier:** Now come on everybody, let's not say something we're going 
             to regret! 
        **Roz:** Oh, you're one to talk! 
    
    _Everyone starts arguing.  Until:_
    
    **Frasier:**[_shouting_] ALL RIGHT! THAT IS ENOUGH! [_they shut up_] This is 
             the night we celebrate _peace_ and _togetherness_!  I will not 
             have that ruined! [_slowly_] I intend to put us all in the right 
             frame of mind, by giving you all my gift.  As you know, I was 
             determined to make my gifts this year a little more 
             meaningful.  And after a great deal of effort I believe I 
             have.  My gift does not come from some fancy store, all 
             wrapped in glittery paper, my gift comes from my heart.  
             Tonight, I intend to sit each one of you down, and tell 
             you in my own words, exactly how much you mean to me. 
    _The rest then begin commenting on how awful the present is: "That's 
    it?"  "Are you out of your mind?" "That's the worst idea I ever heard!"_ 
    **Frasier:** Or, I could get someone over to give us all massages. 
    _The rest say what a much better idea that is after four tough days.  
    Frasier picks up the phone. 
    
    End of Act Two.  Time: (21:22)_
    
    **Credits:** 
    
    We see Niles at the piano, with Roz, Daphne and Martin singing 
    "Deck the Halls."  All are wearing bathrobes, and all look very 
    relaxed.
    
    The "bozo" from upstairs hits the floor again, which gets the three 
    mad.  Martin and Niles yell, "Oh, shut up!"  Daphne goes out to the 
    balcony to shout upwards, and Martin calls him on the phone.  Roz is 
    confused by it all.
