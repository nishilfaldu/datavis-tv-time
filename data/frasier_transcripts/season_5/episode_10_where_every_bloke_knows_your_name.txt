    Act One.
    
    **A LONG TIME AGO
    IN A PREP SCHOOL
    FAR, FAR AWAY...**
    
    _Scene One
    Many years ago, in a Seattle prep school, a young Niles and a young 
    Frasier are having lunch and a discussion in the school cafeteria. 
    Of course, they were even more snobbish then than they are today.
    As Frasier eats, Niles carefully wipes his utensils with a napkin._
    
    **Young Frasier:** I specifically requested my macaroni & cheese _al dent e_.  
      **Young Niles:** I know.  This lunch is a culinary Hindenberg.
    **Young Frasier:** Niles, have you ever considered that our food may be 
                   payback for your recent editoral, "Cafeteria Of Shame"?
      **Young Niles:** Well, they can't intimidate me.  They'll never silence 
                   my pen.  I could write an expose on their baked goods 
                   alone. 
    **Young Frasier:**[_knocks bread roll on table before a pun alert:_] Yes, 
                   this is the hardest roll since Hamlet!
      **Young Niles:** Good one, Frasier.  May I use it?
    **Young Frasier:** But of course.
    
    _Fade Back to the present day, Niles and Frasier are in Caf e Nervosa, 
    still whittling on about the food._
    
      **Niles:** These biscotti represent an all-time low.  Chalky aftertaste,
             inelegant aroma, spongy!
    **Frasier:** Yes, and what is a spongy biscotti but an unwelcome trespasser 
             into Madeline territory?
      **Niles:** Have you seen how stale these pistachios are?  It's like
             swallowing gravel.  It's a wonder I escaped permanent injury. 
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Yes, your ability to cheat death at every turn
             never ceases to amaze. 
      **Niles:** Someone's in a mood today.
    **Frasier:** Yes, sorry Niles.  You know sometimes you just find yourself
             getting restless?
      **Niles:** I'm fearing I'm about to. 
    
    _Niles mobile sounds to which he answers._
    
      **Niles:**[_to phone:_] Hello.  Yes?  Really?  Bravo!  _Excellent e!
             Benissimo!_ [_hangs up:_] You'll never guess who that was!
    **Frasier:** The Three Tenors?
      **Niles:** No, it was my antiques scout.  The present I ordered for
             Maris's birthday has arrived.  I got her the most exquisite
             antique saddle. 
    **Frasier:** Oh.  How's it look on you?
      **Niles:**[_looks at Frasier:_] You won't laugh when you see it.  It is
             bejewelled but not overdone, much like my Maris.  The
             craftsmanship is breathtaking.  It's been so expertly
             restored you can barely see the stitching.
    **Frasier:** Again, like Maris!
      **Niles:** Someone _is_ in a mood today. [_receives bill:_] I'll get this.
    **Frasier:** Thank you Niles, it's... perhaps you can run along to the wine
             club on your own tonight.
      **Niles:**[_surprised:_] What?
    **Frasier:** Well, it'll just be the same old faces rehashing the same
             boring topics. 
      **Niles:** You're more upset than I realised.  Let's do something to
             take your mind off it.  Dinner?  Chamber music?  There's a
             wonderful lecture series on the histroy of modern lecture
             series. 
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I don't think so.  You know, I just feel like 
             being on my own tonight.  You don't mind, do you?
      **Niles:** Of course not, I'll just see you at Puchino for lunch
             tomorrow.
    **Frasier:** Well maybe we ought to play that by ear as well.
      **Niles:** As you wish.
    **Frasier:** You're not upset, are you?
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'd have to have a pretty fragile ego to be upset
             just because you want to take some time away from me.
     **Waiter:** Do you want to pay?
      **Niles:** Separate checks, please! [_turns away from Frasier_] 
    
    _Scene Two - Apartment
    Later, back at Frasier's apartment, Martin's card friends are 
    waiting.  There's Roz, Frank, Leo, Jimmy & Duke.  Martin's in the 
    kitchen preparing his food.  Frasier watches him whilst Daphne does 
    the dishes._
    
     **Martin:** Alright.  Here we go: cold cuts, pizza rolls, deviled eggs,
             pork roll-ups; all right.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Yes, the ideal buffet for a group of heavyset
             men over sixty!  I assume everyone's ready to order.
     **Martin:** Well, we're about ready to start our poker game.
     **Daphne:** Don't worry Mr. Crane, I'll be on my way in a minute.
     **Martin:** OK.  Well, we're about ready to start our poker game.
    **Frasier:** I heard you, dad.  I'm just trying to figure out what I'm 
             going to do with myself this evening.  My old routine doesn't
             seem to satisfy me anymore, I'm trying to think of something
             new.  Oh, I know - maybe I could join you and the guys for 
             some cards, eh?
     **Martin:** Oh, I don't know about that, Frasier; I just don't think
             you'd fit in! 
    **Frasier:** Why not?  Roz is playing!
     **Martin:** Roz is like one of the guys.  She knows more dirty jokes 
             than Duke!
    **Frasier:** Oh, if that's the criteria, I'm sure I could tell you a tale
             or two which would make you blush like a school girl.
     **Martin:** That's what I'm afraid of!
     **Daphne:** Oh let him play, it can't hurt anything. 
     **Martin:** Alright, come on.
    
    _Martin enters the room with Frasier following carrying the tray. 
    Frasier sits between Roz and Martin._
    
    **Martin:** Guys, Frasier's going to sit in with us tonight. 
    
    _The guys give a polite manly cheer._
    
        **Roz:** Really?  You're going to play with us.
    **Frasier:** Why not, Roz?  Don't look so surprised.  'Sides, there's 
             nothing I enjoy more than a good old-fashioned night with 
             the guys. 
    _He sits at the table with them, next to Roz._
      **Frank:** OK, get ready, seven buck limit high and low, chips to win, 
             high and low, the wheel is no good.
    **Frasier:** Perfect.
        **Leo:** No Check in rays?  Three buck limit.
    **Frasier:** Sounds good.
        **Roz:** You're lost, aren't you?
    **Frasier:** Like a Bedouin in a sandstorm!
        **Leo:** So, you guys got your all-weather tires on ya?
      **Frank:** I'm going to Richie's for some bodywork afterwards.
        **Roz:** Go to Tim's, you get free a overhaul.
       **Duke:** You ever been to Hank's?  Now there's a garage.
     **Martin:** King bets, fifty cents.  Yeah, I've been to Hank's, right 
             next to Mike's Hardware, right?
      **Jimmy:** Why I was in Mike's the other day, they got those new
             cordless drills.
      **Frank:** Still go to Mike's?  You ought to try Tommy's. They give 
             away free battery testers with every purchase.
    **Frasier:** I'm out!
    
    _Frasier gets away from the non-sensical mayhem to Daphne in the 
    kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that was a bust! 
     **Daphne:** Be glad before the debate begins over who would be the most 
             fun on a desert island - Angie Dickinson or Ursula Andress? 
    **Frasier:** That's ludicrous... it's Angie Dickinson. 
     **Daphne:** You know, Dr. Crane, I know it's none of my business but... 
             Oh, never mind.
    **Frasier:** No, no, go ahead.
     **Daphne:** Perhaps you've been feeling restless lately because of a
             lack of, well, you know, female companionship.  So I
             thought...
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear!
     **Daphne:** Just listen.  I'm meeting my friend Clare for drinks tonight
             - she's complained of feeling restless...
    **Frasier:** Just stop right there.  I think by now you'd know my policy
             on fix-up's.
     **Daphne:** She's pretty, she's lonely and she's an underwear model. 
    **Frasier:** So you do know my policy.  Off we go!
    
    _Frasier and Daphne leave._
    
    **SO AUTHENTIC THERE ISN'T
    AN ICE CUBE IN THE JOINT**
    _Scene Three - The Fox & Whistle
    A few moments later, they arrive at "The Fox & Whistle", a typical 
    English pub.  There are English flags around the place and other 
    Anglican items. _
    
     **Daphne:** Say hello to the "Fox & Whistle."
    **Frasier:** You point her out and I will! [_laughs_]
    **Winston:**[_in English accent from behind the bar:_] Hi-ay love, give us
             a kiss!
    **Frasier:** Hope he's talking to you.
     **Daphne:**[_goes forward_] Evening, all! 
    
    _Clare, a slender redhead sitting at a table with two men, sees her._
    
      **Clare:**[_comes over_] Daphne!
     **Daphne:** There's Clare now.
    **Frasier:** My, she's everything you said she was...
      **Clare:**[_excited:_] I'm engaged!
    **Frasier:** And more!
     **Daphne:** When did this happen?
      **Clare:** Well, my old boyfriend, Bob, surprised me two nights ago.  
             You gotta meet him, he's right over there. 
    
    _Someone who looks utterly different gives a wave.  He's sitting next 
    to another man._
    
     **Clare:** He even brought someone you might be interested in.
    **Daphne:** Oh, he is nice looking, isn't he?
    _Bob, who is apparently deaf and dumb, slowly mouths, "I LOVE YOU" 
    to Clare while signing the same with his hands._
     **Clare:** Coming, pookie.
    
    _Daphne turns to Frasier for sympathy._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh sorry, Dr. Crane, it seems like I've brought you down 
             here for nothing.
    **Frasier:** Oh hardly.  If not for you I would have missed seeing the
             World's Most Nauseating Couple defend their title. 
    
    _A quick shot of Clare and Bob is shown._
    
     **Daphne:** We can leave if you like.
    **Frasier:** No, no, you go talk with your friend; I'll have a drink.
     **Daphne:** You sure?
    **Frasier:** Sure. [_turns to bar as Daphne exits_]
    **Winston:** What d'ya need?
    **Frasier:** Well, funny, I've been asking myself that same question all
             day, it seems that lately my life...
    **Winston:** I'll come back. [_serves someone else_] 
    _Scene Four - Apartment
    Meanwhile, Martin, Roz and the gang are still enjoying their chat 
    over their game of cards._
    
     **Frank:** I forgot that story!
    **Martin:** Oh geez, it still doesn't top the time Leo and I were sent to
            break up that fight in the strip joint.
       **Leo:** Oh, boy!
    **Martin:** We walked in there and I'm telling you there was this one
            girl...
     **Frank:** Hey Marty, Marty!  Maybe you shouldn't tell that story.
    **Martin:** What, because of Roz?
       **Roz:** Oh please, Frank!  If I can handle the Angie/Ursula debate, I
            think I can handle this!
       **Leo:** But you agree with me on that one, right?  You said you'd
            rather sleep with Angie?
       **Roz:** One more time Leo. [_slowly:_] If I had to choose, yes!
    **Martin:** Hey Leo, you start telling them that strip joint story; you
            guy's are going to bust a gut!  Anyone else need a beer?
    **All Bar**
       **Roz:** Yes!
    **Martin:** Roz? 
       **Roz:** Remember?
    **Martin:** Oh geez, I'm sorry, I forgot, yeah! [_goes to the kitchen_]
     **Frank:** What's the matter, Roz?  You think you won't be able to control
            yourself with all these handsome guys here? [_laughs_]
       **Roz:** It's a little late for that, Frank.  I'm pregnant.
     **Frank:** What?!  That's great!  I remember when my Annie was pregnant.
            There is nothing more beautiful than a pregnant broad!
       **Leo:** You're in for a real treat, Roz.  The best thing I ever did
            was having kids. 
      **Duke:** You know from the moment you hold that brand new baby in your
            arms, your whole life changes.
     **Jimmy:** You're right about that!
     **Frank:** What about when they grab your fingers with those little
            hands, that's one of the greatest feelings there ever is. 
      **Duke:** Yeah the joy of seeing them look up at you and smile.
     **Jimmy:** Cherish every moment, Roz. 
     **Frank:** He's right.  One minute they're sitting on your lap; you're
            their whole world.  Next thing: they're growing up, out of the
            door with lives of their own!
       **Leo:** And it's just you, old and alone in an empty house. 
      **Duke:** It's so empty.
    
    _They all sit in morbid silence, thinking about how bad their lives 
    are and how bad Roz's life will be.  Martin enters and is surprised by 
    this lifeless scene._
    
    **Martin:** Leo, I don't think you told that story right!
    _Scene Five - the Pub
    Meanwhile, in the Ladies room at the "Fox & Whistle", Clare and Daphne 
    are having a little chat.  Daphne is carefully brushing out her hair._
    
     **Clare:** I think that Steven likes you!
    **Daphne:** I hope so.  He's adorable.  I must say I was flattered when 
            he assumed I was an underwear model too.
     **Clare:** I noticed you didn't rush to correct him.
    **Daphne:** There'll be time for that after the wedding! [_they laugh_] 
            Ah, maybe I should just tell Dr. Crane to run along home. 
     **Clare:** I'm surprised you even brought your boss down here, I
            couldn't never relax around mine.  What if he took a liking 
            to the place?
    **Daphne:**[_laughs_] Oh that's nothing I have to worry about, this pub
            really isn't his style!
    
    _Daphne and Clare leave the ladies to find a big group around the 
    piano singing "Roll Out The Barrel."  Frasier is mid-centre._
    
       **Gang:** Zing, boom, tararrel!
             Ring out a song of good cheer! 
             It's time to roll out the barrel! 
             Coz the gangs all here!
    **Frasier:** Daphne, come and sing a song with us!
     **Daphne:** Well, actually...
    **Frasier:** Oh, you're not shy about singing in the house. 
     **Steven:** You two live together?
    **Frasier:** Yes!  She's my dad's health care worker.
     **Steven:**[_to Daphne:_] I thought you modeled underwear!
    **Frasier:** No!  Only if her robes aren't stitched up tight enough! 
             [_laughs_]
    
    _Steven walks away; Daphne shouts after him._
    
    **Terrence:** Come on Frasier, we're going to do "Knees Up Mother Brown".
     **Frasier:** I don't know "Knees Up Mother Brown".  I know what, let's
              bring some sheet music tomorrow night.
      **Daphne:** Tomorrow?!
     **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Daphne:** But you can't!  I mean... do you know you have that gallery
              opening tomorrow? 
     **Frasier:** No, but if you hum a few bars I'll try to pick it up! [_laughs_]
    
    _The gang begin singing "Roll Out The Barrel" again as Daphne looks 
    bewildered and angry. The scene freezes at the end of the act with 
    Frasier having fun.  This looks similar to the "Cheers" opening 
    credits.
    
    End Of Act One. (Time: 9:12)
    
    Act Two. 
    
    Scene One - Apartment
    Martin is on the phone to Sherry, he's ready for some action._
    
    **Martin:**[_into phone:_] Hey Sherry, Daphne's finally clearing out for
            the night.  Why don't you come over?  I'll, er, you know, get 
            a fire going, open a bottle of bubbly, put a little Bobby 
            Darin on the stereo, and then look out, Mackie's back in town!  
            Yes, I thought it up before I called you.  What's the 
            difference?  OK, see you soon. [_Daphne enters_] Wow, 
            Daphne, don't you look beautiful.
    **Daphne:** Thank you.  It's so nice to finally have my pub back 
            again.  At least for a night.
    **Martin:** Yeah. 
    **Daphne:** You are sure Dr. Crane has plans?
    **Martin:** Oh, yeah, Niles called; they're going to the opera. 
    **Daphne:** Let's hope it's one of those long German ones - I don't want
            him showing up for last call!
    **Martin:** Right!
    
    _Martin leaves to his bedroom as Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Good evening, Daphne.  Wow, you look smashing!
     **Daphne:** Oh thanks, I'm was just on my way out.
    **Frasier:** What, to the "Fox & Whistle"?  I'll go with you!  Let me 
             just grab me mack and me brolly and Bob's your uncle!
     **Daphne:** But wait!  I thought you were going to the opera with your
             brother?
    **Frasier:** That's tomorrow night.  Gee, I hope Winston's at the pub - 
             I owe him five quid from the other night!
     **Daphne:** Suddenly I'm not feeling so well.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  I hope it's not that flu that's going around. 
     **Daphne:** I think I'll just stay home tonight.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, that's probably for the best.  You've got to be
             careful what you bring down to the pub with you.
     **Daphne:**[_trying to drop a hint:_] Tell me about it!
    
    _At that moment Niles enters from the front door._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles. 
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Something the matter?
      **Niles:**[_pouring a sherry_] Oh, I had a rough night last night. 
    **Frasier:** How so?
      **Niles:** Oh, I gave Maris her birthday saddle. She was so thrilled
             she treated me to a little Lady Godiva impression.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my!
      **Niles:** Apparently the oils in the saddle reacted badly with her
             cellulite cream and created a powerful epoxy. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear!
      **Niles:** Yes, it took an hour and a full bottle of nail polish
             remover to get her free.  Today her poor little thighs were
             so sore the only way she could find comfort was to straddle
             a frozen butterball turkey.  The only thing that cheered me
             up all day was the thought of our box at the opera tonight.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's tomorrow night, Niles.
      **Niles:** No, no, it's tonight.  I have the tickets right here. 
             [_waves them_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, no.
      **Niles:**[_surprised:_] Is there a problem?
    **Frasier:** Well yes, there's a billiard tournament at the pub tonight. 
      **Niles:** You're passing up "Orpheus & Eurydice" to shoot pool at some
             sticky-bear salon?!
    **Frasier:** Yeah well, my partner, Terrence has agreed to skip a family
             wedding just to participate - I can't leave him in the lurch. 
             Isn't there somebody else who could take my place?
      **Niles:** At this point I just so need to be by myself.  My brother 
             has abandoned me, my wife is cursing my name.  Tonight when
             Orpheus descends into hell, I'll be there waiting for him
             with a fruit basket! [_exits, Frasier follows_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles!  You can't stay mad at me, I promise I'll make it
             up to you.  Press for the lift, won't you?  Don't look at me
             that way, that's what they call it!
    _Frasier and Niles leave as Martin enters.  He dims the lights down 
    and lights a couple of candles as he prances around, excited.  Daphne 
    suddenly walks in, in robe, and brings the lights back up._
    
    **Daphne:** Why is it so bloody dark in here?  It's bad enough I have to
            stay home all evening, I'm not going blind as well!
    **Martin:** What?  You're staying in tonight?
    **Daphne:** I don't have much choice, since that son of yours decided to 
            go to my pub again.  I mean, imagine being so dense that he 
            can completely ruin someone else's evening and not even be 
            aware of it.  This wax is dripping! [_blows out candles_]
    **Martin:** Have you tried maybe dropping a hint? [_pops open the
            champagne loudly_]
    **Daphne:** Oh believe me, I've dropped plenty; they go right over his
            head! [_notices bubbly:_] Oh, I'll have a glass of that! 
    **Martin:** Daphne, I've got to level with you: Sherry's coming over and 
            I really hoped to have the place to myself tonight.  You know,
            I really think you should talk to Frasier, and I'm not just
            saying this because I want you to get the hell out of here!
            It's your pub and you ought to tell him that he's got to find
            his own place.
    **Daphne:** I can't say that!
    **Martin:** Well the longer you let it go, the more attached he's going
            to get to that place.
    **Daphne:** But he's my boss.
    **Martin:** But it's your pub. 
    **Daphne:** OK.  That's it, I'm going to talk to him.
    **Martin:** Good for you. 
    
    _The phone rings as Daphne leaves.  Martin answers it._
    
    **Martin:**[_to phone:_] Hello?  No, Maris, sorry, you just missed him.  
            Why are you teeth chattering?  You're kidding me.  Can't you 
            just use the defroster?!
    _Scene Two - The Pub
    In "The Fox & Whistle", Frasier is giving his sorrows to Terrence 
    about his billiard playing._
    
     **Frasier:** Gee Terrence, I never dreamed we'd be eliminated from the
              tournament in the first round.  Guess I'm a little rustier
              than I thought.  Hey, maybe you can still make that wedding
              reception.
    **Terrence:** It's in Liverpool!
     **Frasier:** Well then, [_takes pints_] these are on me. 
    
    _Winston notices Daphne and everyone says "hi."  This is getting 
    to be quite the clich e by now._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, I have to talk to you.
    **Frasier:** By all means, Daphne.  Oh, Winston, let's have one of these
             pints for Miss Moon, please. [_he hands one over_] Oh, this is
             a really nice surprise, Daphne, you must be feeling better.
             Here we are.  You make a toast. 
     **Daphne:** I don't want you coming down here ever again!
    **Frasier:** Well, I guess "here's mud in your eye" sounded mean the
             first time too!
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry if that sounds a bit harsh, but I don't know what
             else to do.  This pub is where I come to get away from things -
             including my job - and you are my boss...
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I'm so sorry. 
     **Daphne:** I know that must sound selfish.
    **Frasier:** No, no, not at all.  You know, back in Boston I had a bar 
             like this one, I certainly understand what it's like to have 
             a place where you can get away.  So, we've just got one
             solution: This is your bar, I'll just go.
     **Daphne:** I do appreciate this, Dr. Crane.  I know you've made friends
             here too.
    **Frasier:** I've only been coming here a week - you've got a history
             here!
     **Daphne:** They've become like family to me.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'll just settle up and go. 
    
    _A man walks in who everybody greets as Freddy._
    
     **Freddy:** Hey, I haven't been gone that long - two months is all.  [_to
             Daphne:_] Who's this pretty new girl?
    **Winston:** Oh, that's Daphne.  She's Clare's friend.  She's only been
             coming in the last month or so. 
    **Frasier:** A month?
     **Daphne:**[_ignoring:_] Hello.  Well, I'll see you at home, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** You've only been coming down here for a month?
     **Daphne:** That's still longer than you!
    **Frasier:** Yes, well there's certainly no way I'm leaving now!
     **Daphne:** What?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, this bar has filled up a void in my life.  I'm not
             just going to throw that away just because you beat me here
             by a fortnight!
     **Daphne:** Stop talking like us!
    **Winston:** Here, here, I don't know what you two are arguing about, but
             we settle things around here with a quick game of cricket.
             [_gives Frasier some darts_]
    **Frasier:** Darts?
    **Winston:** Yeah, rules are on the board. 
     **Daphne:** There's gotta be a better way than that.
    **Frasier:** Oh I don't know.  It's decisive, better than standing around
             here bickering.
     **Daphne:** It's not exactly my game.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not mine either.
     **Daphne:** Well, alright.  Let's try it. 
    **Frasier:** You shoot first, Daphne.  You know, I'm rather proud of us:
             two people in conflict, we've found a civilised way to
             settle it.
    
    _Daphne throws her first dart and Frasier notices what she has done._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, my! 
     **Daphne:** Is that good?
    **Frasier:** Quite good.
     **Daphne:** Lucky shot, then.
    
    _Daphne throws her last two shots._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne, If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying
             to hustle me!
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] Oh, not at all.  I may have played a game or two of
             feathers in my day. 
    **Frasier:** A game or two?  You've just made about the most difficult
             shot on the board!
     **Daphne:** Actually, that's only the second most difficult.
    
    _Frasier takes his first shot._
    
     **Daphne:**[_taken aback_] That's the most difficult. 
    **Frasier:** Come to think of it, there might have been a dart board in 
             that bar in Boston...
    _Scene Three
    Later, Daphne and Frasier are nearing the end of their game._
    
     **Daphne:** Well look at that, it's all tied up!
    **Frasier:** Yes, who would have guessed those hands are so skilled.
             Certainly no one who's sampled your corned beef hash! [_throws
             shot:_] Ha!  I score again!
     **Daphne:** That's not something we hear out of your mouth very often!
    
    _Daphne lines up her next shot._
    
    **Frasier:** You don't want to rush this. [_Daphne loses her
             concentration_] A lot riding on this shot. [_She loses it
             again_] 
     **Daphne:** There is such a thing as sportsmanship.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  This from a woman who made armpit noises during
             my last round!
    
    _Daphne plays a bad shot._
    
     **Daphne:** Sod!
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] I am so sorry, Daphne!  Now all I have to do is
             make this relatively simple shot - unless of course you'd like
             to concede defeat.
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] That's typical American arrogance.  We Brits don't
             know the meaning of the word "defeat!"
    **Frasier:** Oh really, then I suppose you're not acquainted with that
             little spat we refer to as the Revolutionary War! 
    
    _The surrounding Anglicans here his words and begin standing up._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, just like a Yank!  Insulting us Brits to cover up your
             inferiority complex!
    **Frasier:** What exactly should we feel inferior about, your pioneering
             work in the field of soccer hooliganism?!
     **Daphne:** Oh, say your worst.  We both know there isn't as much dignity
             in this entire country as our Queen's got in her little
             finger.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Oh yes, you've really bested me there, what
             could be more dignified than a dainty old sandbag who wears
             a flowerpot on her head! [_takes shot_] I win!  The bar is mine!
    
    _Frasier turns round and sees everyone looking down on him in a gang._
    
     **Frasier:** Oh, lose the long faces, lads, I'm staying.  Oh good Lord, 
              I hope you didn't take those little barbs about the motherland 
              seriously!
    **Terrence:** Perhaps you'd better leave now.
    _They march forward as one, pressing him out._
     **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne'll tell you there's no greater Anglophile than I.
              I have all my suits made at Savile Row.  I spell "colour" with
              a "u!"
    _But he's gone.  Daphne smiles and takes a stool.
    
    Scene Four
    The next day, in Caf e Nervosa, Frasier meets Niles after a long time 
    away._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Well, look who's here.  Take a wrong turn on the way to the
             pub?
    **Frasier:** Actually, that scene has grown tiresome, and I... I miss this
             place.
      **Niles:** I've spoken to Daphne.  I take it it's over over there.
    **Frasier:** You don't have to rub it in.  Anyway, I know I owe you an
             apology for the other night so, here.  I've brought you a 
             peace offering. [_hands a CD to Niles_]
      **Niles:** "Orpheus & Eurydice", thank you Frasier. [_gasps:_] The
             Glyndeborne production!  I don't have this one.
    **Frasier:** You're going to love it!  The choice is particularly moving, 
             and Janet Baker's Act Three aria is...
    
    _Now we travel back in time to prep school where a young Frasier is 
    also giving a peace offering to young Niles._
    
    **Young Frasier:** -is quite simply it's the best consecutive aria I've 
                   ever heard.
      **Young Niles:** Oh thank you, Frasier.  I don't have "Orpheus &
                   Eurydice" on 8-track yet!  I'm surprised to see you -
                   [_sarcastic:_] No woodworking club today?
    **Young Frasier:** Oh, to tell you the truth, I've grown tired of that
                   crowd, with their stupid bookends and birdhouses.  As
                   soon as I've finished slacking my shoe trees I'm out 
                   of there. 
      **Young Niles:** You got thrown out, didn't you?
    **Young Frasier:** I did not.
      **Young Niles:** Frasier, I can see right through you.
    **Young Frasier:** Are you a psychiatrist?!
      **Young Niles:** Oh no, I'm not a psychiatrist but I can see it in your
                   face...
    
    _They begin arguing just as they do in the modern day._
    
    _End Of Act Two. (Time: 20:00)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    _It's Martin's poker night again. Frasier has decided to sit in. 
    Martin leaves to get the beers but Frasier manages to hustle them 
    away to the other side of the room.  He gets them on the piano - 
    singing.  When Martin comes back he's mad so he sits down and cheats 
    on the poker game._
