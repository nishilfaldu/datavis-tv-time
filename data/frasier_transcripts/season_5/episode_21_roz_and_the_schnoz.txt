## Peri Gilpin Introduces... {nick hartley}

    
    
    
    _On Paramount Comedy Channel's "Frasier Weekend" Peri Gilpin (who 
    plays Roz Doyle) introduced this episode of Frasier. She was sat on 
    the set of "Caf e Nervosa" as she said the following:_
    
       **Peri:** Roz and Schnoz is one of my favorites because I'm about nine 
             months pregnant, I'm just about to have this baby, I find out 
             that I'm going to meet the parents of the father of my child. 
             I'm nervous, I don't want to meet them, I realize I have to 
             and they show up and they've both got these GIANT noses. 
    
    _A clip of Roz and Schnoz is shown. Paula and Steve are in Frasier's 
    apartment talking to Frasier:_
    
      **Steve:** We hope this isn't too awkward for her.  She sounded a 
             little anxious on the phone.
      **Paula:** Then again, who could blame her?  She doesn't know what 
             kind of people we are.  A situation like this is enough to make
             anyone a little nervous.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually you know, Roz really isn't the nervous type.
    
    _Roz then opens the powder room door and nearly falls over when she 
    sees the two large noses. The clip then finishes as Peri resumes._
    
       **Peri:** The couple that plays the couple are a couple in real life. 
             And they played it so beautifully and so well that we could 
             not get through a take. The audience was laughing, we were 
             laughing, in fact you can see in the episode that people are 
             just laughing in the background.
    
    _Another clip of the episode now has Niles, Daphne, Frasier, Roz and 
    the Garretts in Frasier's apartment. Niles and Daphne are trying to 
    control their laughter without success._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, why don't you show the Garretts the view?
      **Paula:** Oh yes that would be nice, I could use a breath of fresh air. 
    
    _Niles and Daphne break apart laughing. Peri resumes as the clip ends._
    
       **Peri:** We couldn't get a straight take, it's wonderful that way.

    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    It's the afternoon when Niles is sipping his coffee reading the 
    newspaper.  Frasier enters and takes the seat next to him._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier, listen to this: [_reads from paper_] "Michael 
             Hawkins of Allentown, Pennsylvania, has agreed to donate 
             his right lung to his younger brother Clovis.  Says Hawkins, 
             �I got two lungs, but I only got one brother.'"  Isn't that 
             something?
    **Frasier:** It certainly is.
      **Niles:** The love one brother feels for the other.
    **Frasier:**[_not surprised_] Hmm, what do you want?
      **Niles:** I need you to come to a dog show with me. 
    **Frasier:** I would rather give you a lung! [_to passing waitress_] 
             Latte, please.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I beg you.  It's at the Seattle Kennel Club tomorrow 
             night and I can't go alone, Maris will be there.
    **Frasier:** And in what class will Maris be showing? 
      **Niles:** She'll be showing no class! [_they laugh_] As she has ever since 
             she hooked up with that reptile, Dr. Schenkman.  This will be 
             my first time seeing them since we filed for divorce.
    **Frasier:** You know, here's an idea, **Niles:** Don't go!
      **Niles:** I've never missed the kennel club show. If I don't go 
             this year, people will think I've let Maris and Schenkman 
             intimidate me!  I want to prove that I'm strong and 
             independent, and I can't do that alone.
    **Frasier:** Well, all right Niles, if it's moral support you need, I'll go 
             with you.
      **Niles:** I'll pick you up around eight. 
    **Frasier:** All right.
      **Niles:**[_looks at watch_] And, I have a patient. [_packs things up_] 
             Thank you, thank you, I knew I could count on you for this, 
             Frasier.  It's nice to know that some things never change.
    
    _Roz enters the cafe in a harried state, carrying two suitcases._
    
        **Roz:** Do you guys know where I can get a cheap hotel room in a 
             hurry?
      **Niles:** Case in point! Goodbye, Roz.
    
    _Niles gets up and leaves as Roz takes his seat._
    
     **Frasier:** Roz, why do you need a hotel room?
         **Roz:** I was supposed to move into my new place today, but they're 
              still painting it.  I can't be around those fumes, and 
              they've already rented my old apartment. [_to waitress who 
              is bringing Frasier's coffee_] Grande decaf Latte, please.
              [_to Frasier_] I am literally on the streets.
     **Frasier:** You just ordered a four-dollar cup of coffee.  "On the 
              street" may be a tad dramatic.
         **Roz:** Well, I've got to start calling around, see if I can find 
              something.
     **Frasier:** You know Roz, if you're stuck, my dad's going to San 
              Francisco for the weekend.  You can always stay with me.
         **Roz:** Wow!  That would sure make things easier. [_quick_] Okay.
     **Frasier:**[_surprised_] Well then, that's settled.  That's that, then.
         **Roz:**[_realizes_] Oh, you were just being polite, you didn't really 
              mean for me to take you up on it.
     **Frasier:**[_covering_] No, no, no, no.  I wouldn't have suggested it if 
              it wasn't something I wanted to do.  You should know that.
         **Roz:** All right.
    **Waitress:**[_brings coffee and bill_] Here you go.  There's your check. 
         **Roz:** I'll get that.
     **Frasier:** No, no, no, let me get that.
         **Roz:** Okay. [_hands it to him_] 
     **Frasier:** Well then, lucky me - I'm getting everything I want today.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier enters his apartment to find a rather worked-up Martin. 
    Throughout this all of Martin's lines sound as if he is stressed._
    
     **Martin:** Well it's about time!
    **Frasier:** Calm down, dad.
     **Martin:** I was starting to get worried.
    **Frasier:** We've got plenty of time.
     **Martin:** My plane leaves at five � clock.
    **Frasier:** I just stopped off for your blood pressure medicine.
     **Martin:** I don't need it!
    **Frasier:**[_stressed too_] Well, pack it anyway!
    
    _Martin calms down and takes the bag that Frasier has brought in. 
    He takes something out and it's a jewellery ring case._
    
     **Martin:** What's this? [_opens it_] Earrings?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just a little something I picked up for Daphne at the 
             drug store.  She ran some errands for me last week.
     **Martin:** Nice.  What are they, sapphires?
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Yes dad, I always buy precious stones at the 
             same counter I pick up corn pads and Wart Be-Gone! 
     **Daphne:**[_enters from her room_] Shouldn't you two be going?
    **Frasier:** Oh, actually Daphne, we're just on our way but first there's 
             a little something I wanted to give you - just a little token 
             of my appreciation.
     **Daphne:**[_excited, takes box_] Oh, Dr. Crane, you remembered!
    **Frasier:** Well, of... course I did.
    _Frasier looks at Martin, who shrugs to show he doesn't have a clue._
    
     **Daphne:** Can you believe it was five years ago today that I came to 
             work here?  I just knew you wouldn't let an important occasion 
             like this go by unnoticed, but I wasn't expecting a gift.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a small gift, a tiny gift...
     **Daphne:**[_opens the box and is shocked_] Oh my God, sapphires!
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] Well, actually Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, these must have cost a fortune!
    **Frasier:** Well, I-
     **Daphne:**[_blabbering_] You know my friend Molly got a diamond bracelet 
             from her boss but she worked for him for ten years _and_ she was 
             sleeping with him!  And now I've got sapphires!  And I didn't 
             even have to sleep with you!  Although now that I've got the 
             sapphires - Oh God, what am I saying?  I'm giddy!  Is it rude 
             if I go and try these on?  I don't care!  I have to see what 
             these look like!  I've never had real jewelry, before, never!  
             I'm speechless! 
    
    _She runs to her room, leaving Frasier shell-shocked._
    
    **Frasier:** Dear God, she believes they're genuine sapphires.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic_] Gee, ya think?
    **Frasier:** I'm going to have to tell her the truth.
     **Martin:** Why?  Didn't you see how happy she was, just let her enjoy 
             them.
    **Frasier:** I can't let her think I gave her something I didn't.  Honesty 
             between friends is far more precious than any gem.  I'm sure 
             Daphne feels exactly the same way.
    
    _Daphne, however, enters, still on a high, now wearing them._
    
     **Daphne:** I feel like a princess!  I'm never going to take them off!  
             Oh thank you, [_hugs him_] thank you, thank you. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Daphne, you know, I'm glad you like them...
     **Daphne:** And you even remembered that sapphires are my birthstone. 
             Is there no end to your thoughtfulness?
    **Frasier:** Somebody has to keep track of these things. 
     **Martin:**[_stressed again_] You know, I really should be getting to 
             the airport!
    **Frasier:** All right dad, I'll get my keys!
     **Daphne:** No, no, absolutely not, I'll drive Mr. Crane.  From now on 
             you're not lifting a finger around here. [_to Martin_] You
             ring for the elevator, I'll just grab my coat.
     **Martin:** All right, but don't dawdle.  My flight's at five, they told 
             me to get there an hour early.
    
    _Martin gets his luggage and moves over to the corridor outside 
    Frasier's apartment.  He is waiting for the elevator when Frasier 
    comes out to see him off._
    
    **Frasier:** Did you remember to pack your medicine?
     **Martin:**[_stressed_] Yes, but I told you, I don't need it!
    
    _The elevator arrives and Roz gets out of it._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, guys.
     **Martin:** Hey, Roz. [_notices bags_] Frasier, help her with that. [_he 
             does_]
        **Roz:** Thanks, and thanks for letting me use your room.
     **Martin:** No problem.
        **Roz:** So, you're off to San Francisco.
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah.  Duke and I took our shore leave there in '52. 
             We're going back to retrace out steps.
        **Roz:** That sounds like fun.
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah.  We had a great time that weekend.  Back then 
             there was no place like Frisco for a single guy cruising 
             the streets looking for a good time.
    
    _Frasier and Roz trade a look._
    
    **Frasier:**[_with a different meaning_] You know dad, I think you'll 
             find that Frisco hasn't changed all that much.
     **Martin:** Well, I hope not! [_laughs and enters elevator_]
        **Roz:** Bye.
     **Martin:** Bye.
    _Daphne enters the corridor from the apartment.  As she talks to Roz 
    she tilts her head and extravagantly brushes her hair back from one 
    ear, making the earrings obvious, or rather making her look mad._
    
     **Daphne:** Hey, Roz.  Just off to the airport, back in a bit, see you 
             later.
    
    _Daphne enters the elevator as Roz enters the apartment. Frasier puts 
    her bags down as she closes the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Come on in, Roz.  
        **Roz:** Thanks.
    **Frasier:** Actually, you're here a little earlier than I expected.
        **Roz:** Yeah, I had to get out of the apartment sooner than I thought.  
             I left you a message.
    **Frasier:** Oh, frankly I didn't check my machine all day today.
        **Roz:** Listen Frasier, thank you so much for this.  I won't be an 
             imposition, I promise.  You won't even know I'm here.
    
    _Frasier switches on his machine to listen to the messages._
    
    **Machine:** You have 13 messages. [_Frasier looks at Roz_]
        **Roz:** I had my calls forwarded, I hope you don't mind.
      **Marco:**[_v.o_] Roz, it's Marco.  I'm coming to town this weekend.  
             Are you busy Saturday night, late?  Call me.
        **Roz:** Obviously, Marco and I haven't talked for a long time.
    **Frasier:** Something tells me you never talked for a long time.
      **Paula:**[_v.o_] Roz, this is Paula Garrett, Rick's mom. [_Roz looks up, 
             alarmed_] We just found out about the baby and well, we think 
             it's important that we meet you.  Uh, we're leaving to see 
             Rick in Paris the day after tomorrow, so anytime before that 
             will be fine.  I'm running out now, maybe I'll try you later. 
             [_beep_]
        **Roz:** Oh my god!
    **Frasier:** Now Roz, just calm down.
        **Roz:** What do they want?
    **Frasier:** Maybe they just want to meet you.  They are the grandparents 
             of your child. 
        **Roz:** Look, I worked all this out with Rick!  He's twenty years old, 
             he's still in college and it's best for everyone if I raise 
             this baby by myself.
    **Frasier:** I know that, but...
        **Roz:** Now I'm supposed to put up with in-laws and I don't even have 
             a husband?!  That's like posing nude for your art teacher and 
             still flunking the course. [_Frasier is shocked_] Shut up! 
             I needed the credits!
    **Frasier:** Roz, listen, all they want is a short meeting.
        **Roz:** Yeah, well, that's what they say now.  What if they want 
             another one after that?  What if they won't leave me alone, 
             what if - what if they don't think I'm a fit mother?
    **Frasier:** What if they turn out to be nice supportive people that 
             you're glad to have in your life?
        **Roz:** I just don't want to do this, Frasier!  It's not comfortable.
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz... You know what, I could go with you, if you like?  
             Oh, better yet, we can have them here tomorrow night.  Niles 
             and I have a dog show around eight o'clock.  They can come 
             before that. 
        **Roz:** I don't know.
    
    _The phone sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** I'll bet that's Mrs. Garrett.
        **Roz:** I'm _not_ here.
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Hello.  Yes, she is.  Yes, she did get your 
             message. [_Roz signals to him to change_] No, no, I'm afraid 
             she won't be able to meet you.  Yes I understand that you're 
             upset.  I'm terribly sorry, goodbye. [_hangs up phone_]
        **Roz:** Thank you, Frasier.  Thank you.
    **Frasier:** That was Marco, now we're calling Mrs. Garrett.
    
    _He picks the phone up and starts dialing.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **WHERE'S A GRINDSTONE
    WHEN YOU NEED ONE?**
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment._
        **Roz:** All right, give it to me straight.  How do I look?
    _Roz enters wearing attire that looks like it's flashed from the 19th 
    Century -- a long black dress with a white collar and cuffs, and a 
    conservative string of pearls.  Of course, her pregnant bump makes it 
    all a little more weird._
    
    **Frasier:** Like Pollyanna grew up and got herself into a little trouble.
        **Roz:** Oh, why am I doing this?  How did I let you talk me into this?
    **Frasier:** I will mean a lot to them.  Besides, it's a chance to learn 
             about your baby's lineage.  A lot of things are inherited, 
             you know.  Like intelligence, artistic ability...
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
        **Roz:** Oh God, it's them.  I've got to check my makeup.
    **Frasier:** Roz, there's no need to panic.  You know, this should be fun! 
             It's like a little preview of who your child might be.
    _Roz enters the powder room as Frasier answers the door to Mr. & Mrs. 
    Garrett.  Steve greets Frasier whilst his wife has her back turned 
    talking to a neighbor.  Steve is a tall, handsome man in his late 
    30's, with an enormous, bulbous nose._
    
      **Steve:** Hi there, Steve Garrett. 
    
    _Frasier, taken aback, shakes his hand mechanically._
    
      **Steve:** My wife's just... uh, honey?
      **Paula:** Well, it was nice seeing you too! 
    _Paula turns round; she also has an enormous nose._
      **Paula:** Oh, what a coincidence, your neighbor goes to my hair salon.  
             Hi, I'm Paula. [_shaking hands_]
    **Frasier:**[_recovering_] Frasier Crane.  Won't you please come in? 
             [_they do_] Roz'll be out in a second.  She just went to 
             powder her... self. 
      **Steve:** We hope this isn't too awkward for her.  She sounded a 
             little anxious on the phone.
      **Paula:** Then again, who could blame her?  She doesn't know what kind 
             of people we are.  A situation like this is enough to make 
             anyone a little nervous.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually you know, Roz really isn't the nervous type.
    _Roz then opens the powder room door, smiling - and nearly falls over 
    when she sees the two large noses._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, this is Steve and Paula Garrett.
        **Roz:**[_astounded_] Hi.
      **Steve:** Hi... oh, that's alright Roz, we don't blame you for being 
             shocked.
      **Paula:** I mean, we're used to it.  You should see the looks we get.
      **Steve:** You were a little taken aback yourself, weren't you, Dr. 
             Crane?
    **Frasier:** Oh-ho-ho, certainly not!
      **Paula:** Oh, come on, it's alright!  Everyone comments on it.
    **Frasier:** Well, I must admit when I opened the door I...
      **Paula:**[_finishes_] ...couldn't believe we were old enough to have a 
             twenty year-old son.
    **Frasier:**[_lying_] Exactly!  You know, you both look so young.  Don't 
             they, Roz?
    
    _Steve and Paula turn to Roz, putting her on the spot._
    
        **Roz:**[_still astounded_] Yes... young.  Very, very, young.
      **Paula:** Oh Roz, I can see you're feeling a little uncomfortable, 
             so let's just say, right up front, that we have no intention
             of intruding on your life.
      **Steve:** Rick told us what a wonderful person you are.  We just wanted 
             to meet you and offer any help or support that you think is 
             appropriate.
    
    _Frasier gives Roz a "what did I tell you?" smile.  Roz unbends._
    
        **Roz:**[_happier and settling down_] Thanks.  That's very nice.
    
    _Daphne then enters from the kitchen with a tray of food.  Paula and 
    Steve have their backs turned to her._
    
     **Daphne:** I thought your guests might be a little peckish.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne Moon, Steve and Paula Garrett. 
     **Daphne:** Hello, I...
    
    _They turn to her and she is astounded._
    
     **Daphne:** I...
    **Frasier:** I know!  It's amazing, isn't it?  They are actually the 
             parents of a twenty year-old.
     **Daphne:**[_glad for the excuse_] Amazing. 
    
    _Steve and Paula go to look at the food as the doorbell sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, excuse me. [_opens door to Niles_] Oh, Niles.  You're an 
             hour early.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry - hey, Roz. [_to Frasier_] Yeah, I thought you might 
             like to grab a bite to eat before the dog show. [_notices them_] 
             Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you had... 
    
    _They turn around._
    
      **Niles:** Had... 
    **Frasier:** Company, yes!  Steve, Paula Garrett, this is my brother, 
             Niles Crane.  The Garretts are the grandparents-to-be of 
             Roz's baby.
      **Niles:** Oh!  Well, nice to meet you. [_to Daphne_] Hey, Daphne.
      **Paula:** Did I hear you mention you're going to a dog show?
      **Niles:** Yes, the Seattle Kennel Club is having its annual event 
             tonight.
      **Paula:** You know, Steve and I went to that a few years ago.  We just 
             love dogs!  We have two giant Schnauzers. 
    _Niles quivers in place, fighting hysterics.  Daphne presses her fingers 
    over her mouth.  Niles sits on the couch with a goofy smile.  Roz looks 
    rather nervous and Frasier looks angry._
    
      **Steve:** My goodness, Paula look at the view!
    **Frasier:** Roz, why don't you show the Garretts the view?
      **Paula:** Oh yes, that would be nice.  I could use a breath of fresh 
             air! 
    _Roz takes the couple out on the balcony and Daphne and Niles release 
    their giggles._
    
    **Frasier:**[_snaps_] Just stop it, the two of you!  My God, you're acting 
             like a couple of two year-olds!
    _As they try to regain control of themselves, Martin comes in the front 
    door._
    
     **Martin:** I'm home.
    **Frasier:** Dad?  What are you doing here?
     **Martin:** Aw, Frisco was a bust!  All our watering holes are gone, the 
             steak house was a sushi bar, and this morning Duke and I went 
             out for a walk.  We passed City Hall, and there's this big 
             crowd, kinda like a pep rally or something.  So, we joined 
             them.  Well, some official guy up front says something that 
             we didn't hear and the next thing you know, everybody's 
             throwing rice and all the men are kissing each other and all 
             the women are kissing each other, and I'm not sure but I think 
             Duke and I may be married.
    _Roz, Paula and Steve enter from the balcony.  Martin has his back 
    turned to them._
    
     **Martin:** Well, the whole weekend was like that!  Just one surprising 
             event- [_turns round_] AAH!
    
    _As he steadies himself against the bookshelf, Niles and Daphne have 
    to hold their giggles in again.  Roz looks even more nervous._
    
      **Steve:** I-I'm sorry, did we startle you?
     **Martin:** Oh, no, no, [_making up_] I-I didn't know we had company.
    **Frasier:** Dad, Dad, this is Steve and Paula Garrett.  They're Rick's 
             parents, you remember Rick?
     **Martin:** Oh sure, yeah! [_shaking hands_] Hi, how are ya?  Nice to meet 
             you, Marty Crane.
    
    _Uncomfortable silence._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, they're just on their way to Paris to visit Rick. 
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah?  That sounds like fun.
      **Paula:** Yeah, I'm just a little nervous.  I hear the Parisians can 
             be kinda snooty. 
    _Now Martin turns away, joining Niles and Daphne in furtive hysteria._
     **Daphne:** Excuse me, I've got something in the oven. [_turns to the 
             kitchen_]
      **Niles:**[_getting up_] Let me help you.
     **Martin:** Yeah, uh, me too!
    _As they leave, Frasier and Roz shrug apologetically at Steve and Paula.
    
    As soon as they make it into the kitchen, Martin, Niles and Daphne 
    collapse with stifled, hysterical laughter.  Martin steadies himself 
    against the refrigerator, Niles falls over, Daphne takes a quiche from 
    the oven and puts it on the side._
    
     **Daphne:**[_whispering_] We've got to stop, they'll hear us!
      **Steve:**[_o.s., re: quiche_] Mmmm, what's that I smell?
     **Martin:**[_whispering_] Probably Japan! 
    
    _Which sets them off anew.  Whilst they are killing themselves with 
    laughter, Frasier walks in and watches over the scene in anger._
    
    **Frasier:**_What_ is the matter with you people?!
     **Martin:** Oh, come on Fras!  Don't tell us you don't think this is 
             funny!
    **Frasier:** Not in the slightest!  These are two perfectly nice people, 
             who happen to have large noses!  The three of you standing 
             in here, sniggering like school childen!  Well, all right, 
             fine.  If you can't get yourselves under control you can 
             just stay in here!
    
    _Frasier enters the living room with the quiche._
    
    **Frasier:** Quiche Lorraine, anyone?
      **Steve:** Quiche her?  I hardly know her!
      **Paula:** Oh, Steve!
    **Frasier:**[_polite laugh_]
      **Steve:**[_puts nose over it_] Boy, that smells wonderful.
      **Paula:**[_with nose over it_] Does it ever.
    
    _Frasier holds in his laughter._
    
      **Paula:** Do you mind if I ask?  Is this homemade or store-bought?
      **Steve:** Honey, don't ask that!  Pardon my wife, sometimes she gets a 
             little nosey.
    _Niles, Daphne and Martin enter the room to hear the following.  
    They are laughing underneath their hands and Frasier tries his 
    utmost not to._
    
      **Paula:** Me nosey?  You're the nosey one in the family.
      **Steve:** Anyone who knows you knows you're nosey!
      **Paula:** Anyone who knows you knows you're nosier!
    _Frasier walks back to the kitchen and hands the quiche off to Daphne.  
    He is obviously ridden with laughter but stopping himself from 
    revealing it._
    
     **Martin:** Something wrong, Fras?
    _As soon as he makes it into the kitchen, he bursts with hysterical -
    and clearly audible - laughter.  Steve and Paula look confused, until 
    he sticks his head back out._
    
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] "Quiche her?  I hardly know her!" [_everyone laughs_] 
             I just got that!
    
    _End Of Act One. (Time: 13:47)
    
    Act Two._
    
    **LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BREATHER**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Later, Roz is pouring herself a glass of water in the kitchen as 
    Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** You know Roz, in spite of a rather shaky beginning, I think 
             this evening's turned out rather well.
        **Roz:** Oh yeah, and you were absolutely right, Frasier.  Now I can 
             see some of the qualities my baby can have.  A great sense of 
             humor... a sweet disposition... a nose like an [_angry_] ANT-
             EATER!
    **Frasier:** Frankly Roz, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing.  
             As I remember, Rick had a perfectly fine nose, and so do you.  
             I'm sure your baby's going to have one too.
        **Roz:** Maybe you're right.  If Rick can beat those genes, my baby 
             has a chance.
    _They enter the living room to find Niles and Daphne talking to Paula 
    and Steve._
    
      **Paula:** So, how long have you been working for Dr. Crane?
     **Daphne:** Five years just yesterday.  In fact, he gave me a beautiful 
             pair of sapphire earrings to mark the occasion.
      **Niles:**[_unbelieving_] Frasier gave you sapphires?
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] Who's for coffee?
      **Steve:** I'll take some.
      **Paula:** You know, you really must show those earrings to my husband. 
             He's a jeweler, you know.  He could probably even tell you 
             what mine the stones came from.
    **Frasier:**[_nervous_] Well, you know, maybe coffee's a bad idea if you've 
             got that early flight in the morning.  Daphne, could you just 
             take this back into the kitchen for me?
     **Daphne:**[_feels ear_] Oh dear, one of my earrings has gone!  It must 
             have fallen off somewhere!
      **Paula:** We'll help you find it.
      **Steve:**[_on his knees_] What does the earring look like?
    **Frasier:** No, no, that's not really necessary.  Once you've seen one 
             sapphire, you've seen them all. 
      **Steve:** Well, that's not exactly true, they vary widely in quality.
    **Frasier:**[_pulls him to his feet_] You know, why don't you just get up?
             You have to get going, you know, we have plenty of people in 
             order to form a search party. [_laughs_] And you know, we'll 
             just trample each other.  Well, good night.
      **Paula:** Alright, we are going to have a big day tomorrow.
    **Frasier:** Uh-huh, and you might as well get a little sleep before you 
             take off.
      **Steve:** You know, if you can't find that earring, I might be able to 
             replace it.  Can I see the other one?
     **Daphne:** Oh, [_begins to take it off_].
    **Frasier:**[_quickly picks up something_] I've got it!  Here it is.  Bon 
             voyage!
     **Daphne:** Thank you, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Alright, Daphne, just a second. [_to the couple_] Well, listen, 
             it was wonderful of you to come. 
      **Steve:** Thank you for having us.  Roz, it was great meeting you.
      **Paula:** Our door is always open.
        **Roz:** Thank you.  You guys have a great trip.
    **Frasier:** Goodnight. [_shuts door on them_]
     **Daphne:** Goodnight. 
      **Steve:** Goodnight.
     **Daphne:** Can I have it then?
    **Frasier:**[_opens his hand_] Oh, I'm sorry, it's just a piece of lint. 
             Well, the search continues. 
     **Daphne:** I feel just terrible!  The one precious thing that anyone 
             has ever bought me in my whole stinking life, and I lose it.
      **Niles:** Daphne, I found it. [_hands it to her_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, I could kiss you!
      **Niles:** Okay. [_she hugs and kisses him_] 
     **Daphne:** What's this?
      **Niles:**[_nervous_] Nothing.
     **Daphne:**[_looks at ring_] The setting's come loose.  It's only blue on 
             top, the bottom's all coppery.  Dr. Crane...
    **Frasier:** I know what you're thinking Daphne, and you're right. 
             Obviously I...
     **Daphne:** You've been swindled!  Where did you buy these?  I want to 
             take these back and tell that lying cheat exactly what I 
             think of him.
    **Frasier:** Actually, you just did.
     **Daphne:** You knew? [_silence_]
        **Roz:**[_embarrassed by scene_] Uh, Niles, how about a cup of coffee?
      **Niles:**[_not about to miss this_] Thanks, Roz, cream and sugar.
    
    _Roz, who didn't expect this answer, just sits on a chair as Niles 
    stands next to Daphne staring at Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm terribly sorry, Daphne, I meant to tell you eventually.
      **Niles:** You didn't need to.  Her earlobe's already turning green.
    **Frasier:** Shut up, Niles!  You see Daphne, the truth is, I didn't 
             remember your anniversary and well, I saw them and I thought 
             they were pretty, so I bought them for you.  You thought they 
             were genuine, you seemed so happy...
     **Daphne:** They are pretty.  I suppose I can have them repaired.  I'll 
             just take them back to the jewelry store. 
    **Frasier:**[_stares at her_] Actually, I bought them at Raymond's.
     **Daphne:** Raymond's drug store?
      **Niles:** Well, the good news is that they'll carry something for that 
             ear infection-
    **Frasier:** SHUT UP!
    _The doorbell sounds.  Frasier answers it to find Mr. and Mrs. Garrett 
    with some photos._
    
      **Paula:** It's us again!  Gee, I almost forgot.  Roz, I brought you 
             something.  I thought you might get a kick out of these.          
             Here are some pictures of Ricky when he was a boy. 
             [_hands them over_]
        **Roz:** Oh, thank you, that is so nice of you. [_looks_] Well, where is 
             he?  I don't see him.
      **Steve:**[_points_] There, in the middle.
        **Roz:** Oh... he looks so different.
      **Steve:** Oh, right, that was before his hockey accident.  The nose job 
             changed his whole face.
      **Paula:** I mean, not that the doctor didn't do a good job, but that's 
             the Ricky you'll see in the baby.
        **Roz:** Well, thanks.  Thanks a lot.
      **Paula:** Oh, you're welcome.  And bye again.
    **Frasier:** Take care.
      **Steve:** Thanks.
    **Frasier:** Good to see you.
    _Paula and Steve exit through the front door.  As soon as Frasier 
    closes it, Roz slams the photos against her chest._
    
        **Roz:** Oh my _GOD!_
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, Roz!  It can't be that bad, let me have a look!
        **Roz:** No, no way, no!  I'll never hear the end of it!
    **Frasier:** Please.
    _Roz releases the photos.  He looks... and mutely shows them to 
    Niles and Daphne.  They stare._
    
      **Niles:** Where _is_ the end of it?
    
    _Roz whimpers.  Frasier comforts her.  The scene FADES OUT.
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    At the end of the day, Roz is sitting up in her nightgown staring at 
    some pictures as Daphne enters, also in her nightgown. She sits at 
    the dining table with her._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, Roz, you're not still looking at that picture, are you?
        **Roz:** Nope, this is a different one.
     **Daphne:**[_looks_] Oh dear, look at the way the ears on this poor little 
             girl stick out.
        **Roz:** It's me.  Aged nine, the year before I got them fixed.
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] Sorry, Roz, I didn't recognize you with those 
             glasses.  Why is one side blacked out?
        **Roz:** I had a lazy eye. 
    
    _Daphne smothers a laugh._
    
        **Roz:** I got that fixed the next year.  Let's just say for birthdays 
             I wasn't asking for ponies.
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] You poor thing.
        **Roz:** I'm just sitting here thinking, what if my kid gets Rick's 
             nose, and my ears and eyes?  Throw in my grandfather's third 
             nipple, I might as well pitch a tent and charge admission.
     **Daphne:** Oh come on, nothing like that's going to happen.
        **Roz:** I just hate the idea of my kid being teased. [_sighs_] I know 
             what that's like.  As long as my baby's in here [_rubs her 
             womb_] I can protect it from anything.  But pretty soon this         
             kid's going to be out there on his own.
     **Daphne:** Every child goes through a bit of teasing.  I mean, it's a 
             part of growing up.  At least yours will be lucky enough to 
             have a mother who understands what it feels like.  And you'll 
             know just what to say to make it all better.
        **Roz:** I really hadn't thought of it that way.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm pretty good at finding the positive in things.  
             I mean, look at what happened to me tonight; I could say, 
             here I've worked for someone for five years and he forgot 
             my anniversary and bought me a worthless piece of blue glass. 
             But I'd rather say he gave me a nice pair of earrings just 
             because he thought I'd like them.  Which is really rather 
             sweet when you think about it. 
        **Roz:** Yeah well, Frasier will be pleased to hear that!
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm not going to tell him! [_they laugh_] Well, I'm ready 
             for bed.
        **Roz:** Yeah, me too. [_they stand_] Thanks again, Daphne. 
     **Daphne:** Yep, you're welcome.
    
    _As Roz gets up, she flinches and puts a hand on her belly._
    
        **Roz:** Ooh!  I just felt a big kick.
     **Daphne:** You sure it wasn't a sneeze?
        **Roz:** Oh, ha-ha!
     **Daphne:**[_laughing_] That's the last one, I promise!
    
    _Roz and Daphne laugh as they exit the room to Daphne's room.
    
    End Of Act Two. (Time: 20:10)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne is talking on the phone when Frasier comes in.  When she hangs 
    up, he apologizes and gives her another jewelry box.  She opens it and 
    sees a diamond pendant.  She is ecstatic, and hugs him in delight.  
    Embarrassed, he leaves.
    
    As soon as he's gone, she rushes to the desk, takes out a jeweler's 
    loupe, and checks the stone.
