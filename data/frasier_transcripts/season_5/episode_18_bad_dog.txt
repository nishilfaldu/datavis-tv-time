    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -  Int. Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier is in a long line behind Bulldog to get coffee.  Bulldog is 
    reading the paper._
    **Frasier:** What's going on, anyway? [_glances at watch_] My God, I've got 
             an appointment in twenty minutes.
    **Bulldog:** Ah, some weenie made a big stink so they've gotta clean the 
             milk steamer every time they use it.
    **Frasier:** Oh.
    **Bulldog:**[_turning back_] Is was you, wasn't it?
    **Frasier:**[_haughtily_] Well, if requesting basic sanitary procedures 
             makes me a weenie, then a weenie be I.
    _Roz enters with a dress bag in her arms._
        **Roz:** Hi, guys.
    **Frasier/Bulldog:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:**[_glances at line_] Oh, God, Frasier, what stupid suggestion 
             did you make this time?
    **Frasier:** Nice to see you, too, Roz.
        **Roz:** Sorry.  I just spent two hours trying on jumbo formal wear 
             for the SeaBea awards.
    _Roz holds up a garish, sequin-covered silver dress with a monstrous 
    silver bow on the back._
        **Roz:**[_smirk_] The best part was when the size two sales girl said 
             I could use this again after my pregnancy.
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps you could... [_gestures_] cut off the bow, 
             remove the sleeves, and, uh...
    **Bulldog:** Stick a pole in it and go camping.
        **Roz:** You know, if I'm gonna stick a pole some place....
    **Frasier:** Children!
    **Bulldog:**[_reaching the counter_] Coffee to go.  Black.
    **Frasier:** I, for one, am looking forward to the SeaBeas.
    **Bulldog:** Why?  You're not gonna win.  They never give it to the emcee!  
             Now me?  I'm a lock.
    **Frasier:** Well, you're awfully cocky.
    **Bulldog:** Hey, if knowing I'm the best thing on the air makes me cocky, 
             then cocky be I.
    **Frasier:** Ah.
    _While they are talking, a man walks in front of them to the left. 
    He's wearing a dark baseball cap._
    **Bulldog:**[_ignoring him_] See?  You're not the only one who can talk 
             classy.
        **Roz:**[_confused_] How is that talking like Lassie?
    **Frasier:** Let's just move on, shall we?
    _Roz walks toward the side of the counter.  Frasier looks at the man 
    who's just passed and then nudges Roz._
    **Frasier:**[_whispering_] Roz!  That man, he's got a gun!
    _Indeed, the man has a gun in the front of his pants, and he seems to 
    be trying to discreetly remove it.  Roz looks and gasps._
    **Bulldog:**[_overhearing_] He's got a gun!
    _Coffee goes flying.  Bulldog grabs Roz and pulls her away from the 
    gunman, falling on the floor.  The gunman makes a run for it and makes 
    it out of the cafe._
    **Frasier:** Roz, are you all right?
        **Roz:** Yeah, uh....
    _Bulldog stands up, dusting himself off.  He sees the gun on the 
    ground and picks it up._
        **Roz:** Bulldog, I can't believe you did that! [_hugs him_] You saved 
             me!
    **Bulldog:**[_confused_] Uh, I just did what anyone would've done.
    _Two women approach._
    **Customer 1:** You were so brave! [_kisses him on cheek_]
    **Customer 2:**[_hugs him_] You're a hero!
    _A large man approaches and tries to hug Bulldog._
    **Bulldog:** Hey, close enough.
    _They shake hands.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **BAD DOG**
    _Scene Two - Int. elevator at Elliot Bay Towers
    The elevator doors are closing._
      **Niles:**[_o.s._] Excuse me, would you hold that, please?
    _The doors open to reveal Frasier.  Niles steps on elevator, wearing a 
    grey billed cap that looks ridiculous on him._
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Frasier, I was just on my way up to see you!
    _Frasier looks at Niles' hat._
    **Frasier:** Niles, what have we determined about your success with... 
             impulse purchases?
      **Niles:** Really?  The salesman thought I could pull it off.
    **Frasier:** My suggestion exactly.
    _Niles removes the cap._
      **Niles:** Fine.  Fine. [_excitedly_] Frasier, ask me if I have news.
    **Frasier:** Actually, I've got some news of my own.  In the cafe today -
             [_glances at Niles, who is glaring at him_] Oh, for God's sake.  
             Niles, do you have news?
      **Niles:** Indeed I do.  First of all, congratulations on your SeaBea 
             nomination.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
      **Niles:** Now, congratulate me on mine!
    **Frasier:** What are you talking about?
      **Niles:**[_pulls out papers_] Well, if you'd bothered to look past your 
             own name on the first page, you'd have found mine right after 
             it on page... [_flips through pages_] fifteen.
    **Frasier:**[_reads_] "Best Performance By a Guest on an Information Show."
      **Niles:** Yes, it's for that spot I did on KJSB when I discussed the 
             psychological effects of long-term inclement weather.
    **Frasier:**[_turning away, amused_] Ah, yes, yes, yes.... Thirty minutes of 
             psychobabble all reducible to one phrase: "Rain, rain, go away."
    _The elevator doors open.  Niles follows Frasier to the door.  Frasier 
    looks for his key._
      **Niles:** I'm hardly surprised you feel the need to belittle my 
             nomination.  In your mind, you're the success, the famous one. 
             I'm just invisible.  That's not the way the rest of the world 
             sees me.
    _Frasier opens the door.  Daphne and Martin rush up to him, ignoring 
    Niles._
     **Martin:**[_hugging Frasier_] Oh, Frasier, boy, am I glad to see you!
    **Frasier:** Oh, thanks, guys, thank you.
     **Daphne:**[_also hugging him_] Doctor Crane, thank goodness you're home!
      **Niles:**[_large, forced grin_] I'm also here!
     **Daphne:** We heard what happened at the cafe.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Niles, as I have tried to tell you, there was an 
             attempted armed robbery today at the cafe.
      **Niles:** Good heavens!  Was anyone hurt?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, thank goodness.  It all diffused rather quickly. 
             Tempest in a tea pot, really. [_rubs Daphne's shoulders as 
             he walks back to hang up his coat_] Thank you.
      **Niles:**[_walking to coat rack and removing trench coat_] Well, that's 
             a relief!  On a more pleasant topic, this afternoon, I found 
             out-
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, hold on a second. [_points at Martin and Daphne_] 
             How did you two hear about it?
     **Daphne:** On the news!
     **Martin:** Boy, Bulldog really saved the day!
    **Frasier:**[_hanging coat, shocked_] They said that on the news?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, how he swept Roz out of the way and then threw his 
             hot coffee on the gunman!
    _Frasier walks over to stand behind Martin's chair.  The others follow._
    **Frasier:** That's not how it happened at all!  Why would he say such a 
             thing?
      **Niles:** Well, it was drizzling today, and people act strangely when 
             it rains, as I pointed out in my SeaBea-nominated-
    **Frasier:** Shut up, Niles.
     **Martin:** Well, then what did happen?
    _FLASHBACK TO: the scene in the caf e.  It plays out step by step as 
    Frasier explains it.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_v.o._] Well, we were all standing at the counter, when I 
             noticed a man with a gun.  I warned Roz.  Bulldog saw a 
             different man reaching for his wallet, and thought he was 
             the gunman.  That's when he grabbed Roz and held her in 
             front of him as a human shield!  But as he did that, he 
             accidentally knocked his coffee onto the actual gunman, 
             burning his hand, causing him to drop his weapon and run 
             out!
    _DISSOLVE BACK TO: int Elliot Bay Towers._
     **Daphne:** And no one else saw that happen?
    **Frasier:** Well, apparently not.
    _Daphne goes to sit on the couch._
     **Martin:** Wow, I can't believe Bulldog'd use Roz like that!
      **Niles:** Why didn't you say anything?
    **Frasier:** Well, I was just so relieved everyone was all right at first!  
             I suppose it did irk me when everyone was praising him, and 
             the owner of the cafe promised him a lifetime supply of 
             muffins! [_pause_] Well, I never thought it'd go this far.  
             I never thought I'd hear it on the news! [_walks over to pour 
             himself a sherry_]
     **Daphne:** I wonder how much that would be, a lifetime supply of muffins?
    **Frasier:** I'm certainly not going to let Bulldog get away with this!
     **Daphne:**[_folding underwear_] I don't think I've ever seen Bulldog eat 
             a muffin.  A lifetime supply would be wasted on him!
    **Frasier:** I'm going to tell him I saw exactly what happened!
     **Daphne:** Now me, I could eat a muffin a day, some days even two knowing  
             they'd be free.  So that'd be... [_thinking hard_] ten a week, 
             fifty-two weeks a year, for at least another... forty years, 
             which works out to.... [_looks aghast at the Cranes_] Twenty 
             thousand muffins!  My life suddenly seems long, measured in 
             muffins.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - int Frasier's booth at the station.
    Frasier is concluding his show._
    **Frasier:** Well, that's all the time we have for today.  Good afternoon, 
             Seattle, and good mental health. [_off-air_] Roz, did you see 
             Bulldog come in?
    _Roz enters, carrying a basket of cookies.  She sets them down by 
    Frasier._
        **Roz:** No, I haven't.  I've been looking for him myself.
    _Frasier reaches for a cookie, and Roz slaps his hand._
        **Roz:** Stop that, they're for him!
    **Frasier:**[_frustrated_] Do you really think he had anything to do with...
    _Bulldog walks by outside the booth, followed by a large group of 
    people._
        **Roz:** There he is!
    **Bulldog:**[_from outside; whistles_] Hey, hey, hey!  Nothing new here.
             [_entering book, pushing his cart_] I take my pants off one 
             leg at a time, just like everybody else.  You can vouch for 
             that, can't you, Myrna?
        **Roz:** Hey, Bulldog, I made these cookies for you.
    **Bulldog:**[_slaps stomach_] Wow, I already had a bunch of muffins, but... 
             there's always room for a cookie. [_takes bite_] Um, where's the 
             milk?
        **Roz:**[_running out_] Ooh, coming right up!
    **Frasier:** Hello, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** Hey, doc!  This hero stuff is the best!  Hey, last night, 
             sisters.  At one point, I was a hero sandwich! [_snickers_]
    **Frasier:** Just drop it.  I saw what you did yesterday. [_standing_]
    **Bulldog:**[_sniggering_] Yeah, I saved your butt.
    **Frasier:**[_angrily_] Saved my butt, my ass!  You pulled Roz in front of 
             you to protect yourself!  Everything else that happened was 
             simply by accident.
    **Bulldog:**[_yelling, pointing_] THAT STINKS!  THAT'S TOTAL BS!  I'm a
             hero!  I'm a brave, brave man! [_lowers voice_] Aw, Jeez, 
             you're not gonna tell, are you?
    **Frasier:** Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
    **Bulldog:** You like muffins?
    **Frasier:** You know what, I was determined to expose you, but it suddenly 
             occurs to me I don't have to.  You'll do it yourself.  And you 
             know why?  Because a guilty conscience needs no accuser. 
             [_turns away_]
    **Bulldog:**[_hopefully_] That means you won't tell?
    **Frasier:**[_turns back, shaking finger_] Once again, I don't have to, 
             because a guilty conscience sleeps in thunder!
    _Bulldog looks confused as he chews his cookie._
      **Frasier:** It means I won't tell.
    **Producer:**[_v.o._] Twenty seconds, Bulldog.
    _Frasier walks toward door._
     **Frasier:** You know, actually I'll be fascinated as a psychiatrist to 
              watch this little experiment.  I know that deep down you 
              feel bad about what you've done.  And you'll feel worse 
              every time you capitalize on it.  How long before your 
              conscience finally overwhelms you?
    **Producer:** You're on.
     **Bulldog:**[_on air_] Hey, sports fans!  This is Bob Bulldog Briscoe, and 
              you're in the doghouse! [_honks horn, barks_] Let's go to the 
              phones!
         **Roz:**[_on air, from inside producer's booth_] Hey, everybody, this 
              is Roz Doyle, and I have some very exciting news!  Each year,
              at the SeaBea Awards, one radio personality receives the 
              Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award...
    _Bulldog looks distinctly nervous.  Frasier watches him with an "I knew 
    it" expression on his face._
        **Roz:**...and this year, our winner is our very own Bulldog Briscoe, 
             who was chosen for his heroism!  Congratulations, Bulldog!
    **Frasier:** Well, what do you say to that, hero?
    **Bulldog:**[_into mike_] Well, this is incredible.  I.. I uh really feel 
             honored....
    _Roz brings in a jug of milk.  Bulldog looks at it guiltily._
    **Bulldog:** But I gotta clear something up.
    _Frasier smiles._
    **Bulldog:** Yesterday, at the cafe, this young lady kept coming up to me
             saying, "You're my hero.  How can I ever thank you?"  Well, 
             I've got a confession to make. [_glances at Frasier_] [_grins_] 
             I lost your number, but if you call in, baby, I've got an 
             answer for you!
    _Frasier walks out, indignant.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene One - Int. Frasier's Living Room at the Elliot Bay Towers.
    Niles sits on Frasier's couch while Daphne stands behind Martin's 
    chair._
      **Niles:** Okay, I'm ready.  Go ahead, Daphne.
    _Daphne takes a deep breath and pretends to be opening an envelope._
     **Daphne:** And the SeaBea goes to... [_Niles looks anxious_] Doctor Niles 
             Crane!
    _Niles plasters a goofy, shocked expression on his face and stand up._
      **Niles:** Oh!  Oh!
    _He walks over to Daphne, who is standing with a garish statuette of
    Frasier's._
     **Daphne:** Congratulations! [_hands him statue_]
      **Niles:** Thank you!  You know, to be accurate, it's traditional for the
             presenter to kiss and embrace the winner.
     **Daphne:**[_confused_] But won't your brother be the presenter?
      **Niles:** Well, we can't know that for certain.
     **Daphne:**[_nods_] Oh.  All right, then. [_kisses and hugs him_]
    _Frasier enters from outside hall._
     **Daphne:**[_pulling away from Niles_] Hello, Doctor Crane!  We're just 
             practicing for Saturday night.  Best-case scenario.
    **Frasier:** Obviously.
    _Martin enters from kitchen._
     **Martin:** Hey, Daph, your pie's done.
     **Daphne:** Oh, thanks. [_to Frasier_] Will you be joining us for coffee 
             and dessert?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no thank you, Daphne.  I'm not very hungry.
    _Daphne exits to kitchen._
      **Niles:** Where've you been?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I've been driving around, thinking.  I can't seem to get 
             this Bulldog thing off my mind.
     **Martin:**[_sitting, pouring coffee_] Well, don't worry about it.  We all 
             get obsessed sometimes.  The important thing is to drop it 
             before you start yakking on and on to someone who doesn't 
             give a rat's ass.
    **Frasier:**[_glaring_] Is that your roundabout way of saying you don't 
             want to discuss it?
     **Martin:** You wanna take the direct route?
      **Niles:**[_sitting at table_] Why do you care so much about Bulldog?
    _Daphne enters from kitchen._
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not really Bulldog, so much.  It's just that I 
             believe that conscience, more than customs and laws, is what 
             prevents people from doing wrong.  To contemplate the idea of 
             an otherwise sane man with no conscience... [_sigh_] It just 
             shakes my entire world view.
     **Daphne:**[_placing food on table_] Well, in our family, we certainly 
             knew the meaning of conscience.  That's what my dad called 
             his wooden paddle.
      **Niles:**[_grimacing, horrified_] Oh, how awful for you!
     **Daphne:**[_matter-of-factly, smiling_] Oh, for my brothers, yes.  But I 
             knew he'd never use it on me, as long as I was always good. 
             [_smile fades_] As long as I was always polite. [_looks 
             disturbed_] As long as I always had a smile on my face no 
             matter how I felt inside! [_slams down the silverware in front 
             of them_] As long as I was always ready to wait on all the men, 
             hand and foot, day and night, year in, year out!
    _The Cranes seem to not know what to say.  They look almost scared._
     **Daphne:**[_brightly_] More coffee, anyone?
    _Niles and Martin hurriedly shake their heads._
      **Niles:**[_standing_] No, no, no, you just have a seat. [_gestures for 
             her to sit at the table, lifts coffee pot, begins to pour_] 
             You... just... here, I'll... for you.
    **Frasier:** Maybe I'm blowing this thing out of proportion.  I just can't
             understand how Bulldog can accept all those accolades and
             not be tormented by it.
     **Daphne:** Well, maybe he is.
      **Niles:** Yes, for all you know, he's at home right now, pacing the 
             floor, unable to sleep.
    **Frasier:**[_nods_] Well, that's a comforting thought, Niles. [_pause_] But 
             we'll never know for sure, now, will we? [_pause_] Well, enough 
             about this.  You know, I think I'm off to bed.  Goodnight all.
     **Daphne:** Goodnight!
     **Martin:** Goodnight, son. [_to Daphne and Niles_] You know, I'm really 
             proud of Fras.  Used to be he'd get a bee in his bonnet, and 
             he'd never get it out.
     **Daphne:** Yes, I thought we'd be hearing about this one for weeks.
      **Niles:** Well, the old Frasier'd be up with this all night.
     **Martin:** Exactly!  Wouldn't be able to sleep until he went over to 
             Bulldog's to make sure he wasn't sleeping.
    _Meanwhile, Frasier sneaks out behind them and closes the door._
     **Daphne:**[_lifting milk to pour into coffee_] I should have told him to 
             pick up some more milk.
    _Niles and Martin nod in agreement.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Int. hallway outside of Bulldog's apartment.
    Frasier walks in, looking for Bulldog's apartment number.  He finds it 
    and knocks loudly repeatedly._
    **Bulldog:**[_o.s._] Okay, okay. [_opens door; wearing a robe_] What're you 
             doing here?
    **Frasier:** I want to talk to you.
    **Bulldog:** Ugh.  This isn't a good time.  I got company.
    **Frasier:**[_angrily_] You have done something horrible, and selfish.  
             And I need to know that you feel bad about it.
    **Bulldog:** What, you've been looking through the keyhole?
    **Frasier:** I'm talking about what happened with Roz!
    **Bulldog:** Aw, not this again.
    **Woman 1:** : [_o.s._] Bulldog, I'm lonely.
    **Bulldog:** Talk to your sister for a sec, I'll be right there.
    _Frasier looks disgusted._
    **Bulldog:** Ooh, man, I gotta go.  See ya _ma�ana._ [_slams door_]
    **Frasier:** Bulldog! [_holds buzzer down_]
    **Bulldog:**[_opens door_] Would you stop that?
    **Frasier:** I am not leaving until I know that you feel some remorse for 
             what you've done.
    **Bulldog:** Wow, this is really bugging you, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Yes!
    **Bulldog:** Well.  Okay.  All right, all right.  The truth?  The truth 
             is I feel bad. [_hangs his head_] I feel real bad. [_pretends to 
             cry_]
    **Frasier:**[_horrified_] You feel NOTHING!
    **Bulldog:** I'm sorry, doc!  These little things just don't get to me!
    **Frasier:** The little thing in question is using a pregnant woman as a
             human shield!  Have you no conscience?
    **Bulldog:**[_hands on hips_] Well, maybe I don't.
    **Frasier:** I refuse to believe that!
    **Bulldog:** Well, maybe it was something I was born without... like, oh, 
             like my cousin.  He was born without a big toe on each foot. 
             I used to sneak up on him and tip him over. [_pause_] I didn't 
             feel bad about that, either. [_turns to go inside_] See ya, 
             doc.
    **Frasier:**[_reaching for him_] No!  No!  No, you don't!  I know you've 
             got a conscience.  It must be buried deep inside there.  I 
             will find a way to get it out of you!
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, you do that, doc.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you mark my words.  I don't know how yet, but come 
             Saturday night you will be so consumed with guilt you will 
             not be able to accept that Man of the Year Award! [_stalks 
             off_]
    _FADE TO:_
    **AND THE WEINER IS...**
    _Scene Three - Int. Reception Hall where the SeaBeas are being held.
    Frasier spots Martin and Daphne coming down the stairs._
    **Frasier:**[_waves_] Daphne!
    _She waves and walks down with Martin to join him, holding her arms 
    out to hug him._
    **Frasier:** Oh, you're gorgeous.
     **Daphne:**[_smiling_] Oh, thank you.
    _She leans in and kisses his cheek as he kisses hers._
    **Frasier:** Dad, not bad, either! [_pats his back_]
     **Martin:** Thanks, although I guess any guy looks good in a monkey suit.
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] On the drive over I started musing about why they 
             call it a monkey suit.  I had quite a few theories on that 
             one.
     **Martin:**[_grins_] Oh, she sure did. [_whispering to Frasier_] Can I get 
             a ride home with you?
    **Frasier:** Of course.
    _Roz walks up in the garish silver dress.  The huge bow is in the 
    front.  Her hair is a mound of curls on top of her head._
     **Daphne:** Oh, Roz, is everything all right?
        **Roz:** Yeah, I'm fine, it's just that my hair is huge and this dress 
             is a joke.
    **Frasier:** No, nonsense, Roz, you look divine.
        **Roz:** No, I look LIKE Divine.  I gotta go sit down. [_moves toward 
             table, then looks at herself_] Oh, my God.  Look at the way 
             the lights are shining on the sequins on this dress!  I'm a
             disco ball! [_leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Well, it certainly promises to be quite a night.
     **Martin:** Yeah!  You know, I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself.  
             I wasn't sure that you would, what with Bulldog getting that 
             award and everything.
    **Frasier:**[_conspiratorially_] Well, Dad, I wouldn't be surprised if 
             Bulldog actually declines that award.
     **Martin:** Why would he?
    **Frasier:** Well, I've arranged a few surprises to prick his conscience,
             until, like Hamlet's stepfather, he totters from the banquet, 
             ghostly pale and gibbering with guilt!
     **Martin:**[_turning around and whispering to stranger_] Can I get a ride 
             home with you?
    _Niles rushes down the stairs toward them._
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, all. [_stops in front of Daphne_] Daphne, you look 
             stunning.
     **Daphne:**[_smiles_] Oh, thanks, you look very smart.
      **Niles:** Thank you.  Of course, I guess it's hard not to look elegant 
             in evening wear.
    _Roz walks in front of them, waving to someone._
       **Niles:** Hard but not impossible.
     **Frasier:** No.  Well, shall we take our seats?
       **Niles:** Yes!  Although if Dame Rumor is correct, I won't be sitting 
              long!  Now are we all at table... [_looks at card_] 105?
      **Daphne:** We're at table four.
       **Niles:** Excuse me. [_goes to a stewardess_] Where's this table?
    **Waitress:** One hundred five... that's the technical awards.  Just go 
              down to the basement, cross through the kitchen to the hall, 
              and ask for the Napoleon Room.
       **Niles:** Oh, the Napoleon Room, that sounds charming.
    **Waitress:** We call it that because the ceilings are so low.
      **Daphne:** What a shame.  Now you won't get to see your brother host 
              or hear all the little jokes he's written....
    _They laugh together._
      **Niles:** Thank you, Daphne, I needed some cheering up.
    _They continue to laugh as they walk away, Niles to go downstairs, 
    Daphne and Martin to sit at table four.  Frasier glares.
    
    Bulldog approaches with a blonde woman._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:**[_to his date_] Aw, Jeez, let's go this way.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, there's no reason to avoid me, Bulldog.  I have no 
             intention of ruining your evening.  In fact, I've gone to 
             great lengths to make it memorable.
    **Bulldog:** Eh, you been sleeping okay, doc?  You look a little tired.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't you worry about me, I'll sleep fine tonight!  The 
             sleep of the just!
    **Bulldog:** Me, too.  The sleep of the just boinked. [_hits Frasier_]
    _DISSOLVE: Time passes.  Frasier is presenting._
    **Frasier:** And the nominees are: "Consumer Forum," Wendy Hashiro, talent, 
             Mike Friedman, producer [_applause_]; "The Doctor Frasier 
             Crane Show," Dr. Frasier Crane, talent, Roz Doyle, producer 
             [_gestures to Roz; applause; Daphne grins brightly_]; and 
             "Bob and Nipsy's Morning Laugh Factory," Bob and Nipsy, 
             talent, Lunatic Larry, producer [_applause_].  And the SeaBea 
             goes to... [_opens envelope_] Well, well.  "Bob and Nipsy's 
             Morning Laugh Factory!" [_music; applause_] Bob and Nipsy 
             couldn't make it tonight, so [_takes SeaBea, pats it_] I accept 
             this award on their behalf.  That brings us to our final 
             category, but rather than compete with the coffee service, 
             let's take a short break, and we'll be right back with... 
             the Man of the Year Award!
    _Frasier walks to seat with Bob and Nipsy's award._
     **Martin:** Sorry you didn't win.
    **Frasier:**[_brightly_] Oh, God, that's all right, Dad!  I'm only 
             concerned about one award tonight.  That's the next one!
    _Niles walks in, Frasier goes over to him._
     **Daphne:** Hey, Doctor Crane!  How did it go?
      **Niles:**[_false cheer_] I lost!
     **Martin:** Sorry you didn't win.  God, I've been saying that a lot 
             tonight. [_pours wine_]
      **Niles:** Oh, look, wine.  They didn't serve alcohol at the technical 
             awards, as I informed so many of the guests who mistook me  
             for their waiter.  You see, I was the only nominee dressed in 
             black tie, except for the one man in front wearing a tuxedo 
             tee-shirt.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Niles.
      **Niles:** At least I didn't come home empty-handed.  We each received 
             one of these handsome certificates [_hands it to Roz_], which
             were given out after we'd folded our tables and stacked our 
             chairs.
    _Niles sits, music plays.
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Reception Hall.
    Sometime later, Frasier continues with the awards._
    **Frasier:** Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.  Now the time has come to 
             present the Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award. [_Susan 
             places award on table_] Thank you, Susan.  As you all know, 
             this award is presented every year to the radio personality 
             who brings _honor_ to our medium.  This year, that person is 
             Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe!  C'mon up here, Bulldog! [_applause_]
    **Bulldog:**[_runs up to front_] [_into microphone_] Wow, what a night, huh?
    **Frasier:**[_takes Bulldog's shoulders and shakes him "affectionately"_] 
             Well, Bob, the night is just beginning for you.  Could we 
             please lower the house lights?
    _Lights lower._
     **Bulldog:** What's going on?
     **Frasier:**[_arm around Bulldog's shoulders_] Just a few surprise guests 
              that I've invited to help you celebrate this evening! [_pats 
              him_] People from your past that've helped make you the man 
              you are today.  Do you recognize... this voice?
    **O'Rourke:** Bobby Briscoe, you've made us all proud.
     **Bulldog:**[_looks around_] Oh my gosh, is that-
     **Frasier:** Yes, it's Father O'Rourke, your boyhood priest and childhood
              confessor! [_applause_] And who's that next to him?
     **McCloud:** Bobby Briscoe, sit down in your chair!
    _Bulldog holds a hand up over his eyes as if to get a better look at 
    who's talking._
    **Frasier:** That's right, it's Mrs. McCloud, your second-grade teacher! 
             [_she waves_] The woman who taught you that _honesty_ is the 
             best policy! [_applause_] And who's that next to her?
     **Nugent:** Drop and give me fifty, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:**[_pointing, excited_] Oh, my gosh, Coach Nugents!
    **Frasier:** It's Coach Nugent, from your peewee football days, the man 
             who taught you that it doesn't matter whether you win or 
             lose but that you play the game fair!
    **Bulldog:**[_covers mike_] You're wasting your time.
    **Frasier:** And who's that next to him?  Yes!  It's the president... of 
             your fan club!  Little Joey Katona, whose only dream is to 
             grow up and be just like you! [_applause, Joey, grinning, 
             squeaks Bulldog-esque horn_] But we're not through yet!  Could
             we please bring the house lights up again?
    _Lights come up._
    **Frasier:** We've saved the best for last.  It's the woman that gave 
             everything to you...
    **Bulldog:**[_into mike_] Well, you'll have to narrow that one down!
    **Frasier:**[_rolls eyes_] The night would not be complete without the 
             woman who taught you right from wrong.... It's your mother, 
             Bernice Briscoe! [_backs away from Bulldog, clapping with rest 
             of audience_]
    _A short, stout woman in a floral print dress walks in from 
    backstage._
    **Bulldog:** Mom!
    **Bernice:** I am so proud of you, Bobby!
    **Bulldog:** Oh, Ma!!
    _They hug.  Frasier leans down toward the mike._
    **Frasier:** Now let's turn the microphone over to our guest of honor 
             this evening.  I'm sure we're all anxious to see [_very tense 
             with anticipation_] what the hero has to say!
    _Frasier returns to his seat._
    **Bulldog:**[_goes up to mike_] I'm really blown away by all this. [_pause_] 
             I didn't think I'd be accepting this in front of all you 
             guys. [_pulls speech out of inside coat pocket_] I wrote up 
             this little speech. [_balls it up_] I can't say this stuff 
             now. [_seems to feel guilty_] What I've got to say is 
             simple.... [_long pause, Frasier smiles; finally, Bulldog 
             grabs SeaBea_] This is totally awesome!  Thank you everybody!
    _Frasier seems blown away himself.  Martin, across from him, shakes 
    his head.  Daphne frowns, as does Niles.  Bulldog walks over to his 
    mom and starts back toward his seat with her._
    **Frasier:** This can't be happening!
     **Martin:** Let it go.
    **Frasier:** I can't!  The man is a coward and he's being rewarded!
     **Martin:** Guess I'm never gonna hear the end of this, now, am I?
    **Frasier:** No!  I'm sorry, Dad, but I won't-
     **Martin:**[_interrupting_] All right, all right, wait just a minute. 
             [_beat; whispering to Bulldog, as he passes with his mom_] 
             Hey, Bulldog, there's a guy right there with a gun! [_points_]
    _Bulldog grabs his mother, pushes her in front of him, and ducks 
    behind her, using her as a shield._
    **Bulldog:** There's a gun!
    _Gasps from all around._
      **Martin:**[_loudly_] Sorry, my mistake.
    **Waitress:** He used his own mother to protect himself!
        **Date:** Eeeeew!
    _Roz grabs Bulldog by the collar._
         **Roz:** Isn't that what you did to me?
     **Bulldog:** No!  I just, uh.... no, no!
     **Bernice:** What is the matter with you? [_starts hitting him in the 
              head_]
    **O'Rourke:**[_standing_] You don't deserve that award!
    _Uproar.  Various people yell at Bulldog as Roz and Mrs. Briscoe take
    turns hitting him._
    **Frasier:**[_smiling_] Thanks, Dad.
     **Martin:**[_grins_] Hey, I'm no hero, I just wanted you to shut up.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Bulldog's mother is ringing his doorbell and knocking repeatedly. 
    Bulldog comes to the door in his bathrobe, turns on the light, looks 
    through the peephole, and mouths, "Go away!  Stop it.  Stop!"  His 
    mother keeps on, though.  He finally opens the door a crack.  His 
    mother smiles and waves for him to come closer.  He does so very 
    hesitantly, and as soon as he gets close enough, she starts once 
    again hitting him on the head, yelling, and shaking her finger at 
    him.
