Daphne stops and looks around for her husband.  Frasier again crashes into the tree and falls over.  Niles is exhausted and reaches for the sports bottle.  However, he is unable to get it loose.  Later, he unwraps a power bar to eat.  But he pulls the wrapper all the way down and his snack falls to the ground while Frasier watches.  He opens the spout on the sports bottle and picks the bike upright so he can drink from it.  Niles and Daphne are at the \"killer tree\", urging Frasier to the side. He makes the turn and avoids the tree, looking happy.  Niles and Daphne cheer him on, then watch him circle around until they have to quickly move aside before Frasier once more strikes the tree head on and ends up on the ground.  Daphne again runs alongside Niles.  They disappear behind the hedge, the music reaches its finale... and this time Niles emerges alone on the bike, smiling triumphantly.
