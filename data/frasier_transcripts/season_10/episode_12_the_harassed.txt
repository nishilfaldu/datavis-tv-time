    _**Skyline:** Radio waves emanante from the top of the Space Needle._
    
    _ACT I_
    
    [_Scene 1 - KACL.
    Frasier is finishing a segment._]
    
    **Frasier:** We'll be right back with Julia Wilcox and our new stock market
             update after this. 
    
    [_He exits the air and removes his phones.  Kenny enters._]
    
      **Kenny:** That's it?  That's your big introduction for Julia?  What
             happened to the copy I wrote for you?
    **Frasier:**[_looking at the copy_] Kenny, come on.  "Julia" does not rhyme
             with "moolah."
      **Kenny:**[_shrugging_] We'll, they're spelled the same.
    **Frasier:** Oh, they are not, stop it.  Isn't it enough that she's getting
             ten minutes of my show?
      **Kenny:** Hey, hey.  We're lucky to have her. [_Roz enters from her booth._]
             Don't be surprised if she ends up boosting your ratings a notch.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but at what cost?  The woman's credibility is questionable.
      **Kenny:** She's credible.  The woman was on CNBC.  She had a syndicated
             column.  You can't hold one mistake against her.
        **Roz:** What'd she do?
    **Frasier:** She wrote a book called _Day Trade Your Way Out of Debt._
             Apparently, some people lost money.
      **Kenny:** I don't see you writing any books.  Now listen, she's a little
             sensitive, so I don't want to hear anyone talking about the book,
             how it ruined her career, that guy who killed himself in 
             Pennsylva... hey, hey, hey!  There she is!  Our financial wizard.
    
    [_Julia has entered at the obvious moment.  She is tall, blonde, slim,
    smartly dressed, and has an immediately apparent air of haughtiness
    and superiority._]
    
      **Kenny:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
      **Julia:** Hello. [_shakes Frasier's hand_]
      **Kenny:** His producer, Roz Doyle.
        **Roz:** Hi.
      **Julia:** Nice to meet you.  So this is my mike?
    **Frasier:**[_with Roz_] Yes.
        **Roz:**[_breaking the ice_] You know, I studied finance in college.
      **Julia:** Hey, that's great.  Can you get me some coffee, Rizzo?
    
    [_Frasier and Roz are both taken aback by this._]
    
      **Roz:** It's Roz.
    **Julia:** Super.  Two creams.  Thanks.
    
    [_Kenny gestures to Roz to comply._]
    
      **Kenny:** So, um, do your intro, we'll do a promo, and then back to you.
             Got it?  Intro, promo, you.
      **Julia:**[_with biting sarcasm_] So, you don't want me to do the intro last?
      **Kenny:** Uh, no, because you see, "Intro" is short for... [_realizing_] Oh,
             oh, oh, I get it!
    
    [_Kenny makes a playful teasing gesture to Julia.  She plays along, but
    with obvious disdain for him._]
    
      **Kenny:** Very good!  You got one past me.  Enjoy it.  It's not going to
             happen again. 
    
    [_He exits._]
    
      **Julia:** And these would be my phones.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes.  I must say that I enjoyed your work on CNBC.  I
             thought that you were an insightful analyst, and I don't
             believe that you were treated fairly.
      **Julia:**[_insincerely_] Thanks.  That makes everything all better.
        **Roz:**[_entering with the coffee_] Ten seconds.
      **Julia:**[_taking the coffee_] Thanks. [_drinking and coughing_] Mmm.
             You call this coffee?
        **Roz:**[_smiling_] Most of it.
    **Frasier:**[_laughing uncomfortably_] That Roz... Let me put that over there.
             [_He distances the "coffee" from Julia, and puts on his phones._]
             Hello, Seattle.  Welcome back!  If you've tuned in for mental
             health advice with an erudite twist, well then, my show will
             be back up at the top of the hour. [_During the course of the
             following speech, Julia is leaning toward the microphone,
             impatiently trying to find a spot to break in._] And now, for
             something new, yet germane, as finances can be the cause of
             that old bugaboo, stress, here now...
      **Julia:**[_cutting in abruptly_] Good afternoon, I'm Julia Wilcox.
             Today's market swerved like a nervous student driver before
             finally winding up in a nice, safe neutral.  We'll discuss.
             Plus, are pharmaceutical stocks still worth prescribing?
             Now this. [_She cuts to the promo.  Frasier has looked around
             incredulously during the course of her speech._]
    **Frasier:** Excuse me.  Uh, I was supposed to introduce you.
      **Julia:** You were cutting into my time.
    **Frasier:** Well, I was giving you an hospitable segue.  You see, I thought
             that since you're new here, I could lend you my equity, if you
             will.  It was just a courtesy...
      **Julia:**[_breaking in again as the promo ends_] Some days on the market,
             it's black Friday, but today, with the NASDAQ slightly down, and
             the Dow slightly up, it was more like "plaid Monday."  Analysts
             spoke out on both sides...
    
    [_In the course of the preceding, Frasier has risen and exited into
    the hall._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_to himself, indignantly_] Next time, I'll get the coffee.
    
    [_He stares into the studio from the hall.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 2 -- Cafe Nervosa
    Roz is seated with a book.  Kenny enters._]
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, Roz.  What 'ya reading?
        **Roz:** Julia's book.  Listen to this.  "Chapter 4: How to Sell Your
             House and Start a Dot.com."
    
    [_Frasier enters._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hey guys.  Oh, Roz, I can't believe you shelled out three
             dollars to revel in someone else's misfortune.
        **Roz:** I was curious.
    **Frasier:** Well, you can get the same thing on tape for a buck-fifty.
             [_taking a seat_] Get this: it's read by Martha Stewart!  How's
             that for your double whammy?
    
    [_They all laugh._]
    
        **Roz:** We should just get rid of her.  I mean, if she were nice, it'd
             be one thing, but she's just rude and arrogant.
      **Kenny:** Whoa, whoa, nobody's getting rid of anybody.  She just filed
             suit against CNBC for wrongful termination.  Legal wants us to
             treat her with kid gloves.
    **Frasier:** Hmm.  Truth be told, I actually feel sorry for her.  She has
             suffered a very public fall.  She must be carrying all kinds
             of guilt about the people who lost their savings following
             her advice.  You know, perhaps I should have a talk with her.
        **Roz:** I wondered how long it would take.
    **Frasier:** What?
        **Roz:** For you to make your move.
      **Kenny:** Hey, I thought there were some sparks between you two.
    **Frasier:** What are you talking about?
        **Roz:** Don't play innocent.  She is right up your alley.  Smart,
             tough, total bitch.  You can't wait to break through that
             wall and rescue her.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, you couldn't be more off the mark.
        **Roz:** Typical man.  You always want to get in there and rescue us,
             but the minute things get messy, you just can't handle it.
      **Kenny:** Ha!  Women want us to think that they're tough, and then all
             of a sudden, they get needy.
        **Roz:** Men are like, "Come on baby, you can lean on me, oops, gotta
             go."
      **Kenny:** Yeah, women are like "Get away, get away.  Don't leave me!"
        **Roz:**[_becoming caught in the heat of the exchange_] Here's men:
             [_she groans disgustingly_]
      **Kenny:** Here's women: Me, me, me, me, me... 
    
    [_He continues the "helpless" squeal, overlapping with Roz's groaning._]
    
    **Frasier:** All right, stop it, both of you!
    
    [_Niles enters._]
    
      **Niles:** Hello, all.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** How's it going?
    **Frasier:** Oh, we're just discussing a new, rather unpleasant colleague of
             ours.  Be thankful you're self-employed.  You don't have to deal
             with these headaches.
      **Niles:** Oh, not so.  I was hoping to come here and complain about my
             office remodel.  I'm annexing the dermatologist's office next
             door, and in a cheap irony, my skin is breaking out.
    **Frasier:** Your spackle allergy again?
      **Niles:** I'm covered with tiny bumps.  It's worse than the summer we
             added the breakfast nook to the tree house.
    **Frasier:** Hmmm.
      **Niles:**[_to an approaching waiter_] Could I have my usual, please?
             Thank you.
    
    [_Julia has now entered and approaches the counter._]
    
        **Roz:** There she is!  Don't come over, don't come over, don't
             come over. [_Julia sits at a distant table._] Oh... look who's
             too good for us!
    **Frasier:** You know what?  I think I will go and offer her an olive branch.
    
    [_Roz and Kenny again begin the "low groan" and "helpless squeal."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it.  Knock it off.
    
    [_Frasier approaches Julia and sits at her table._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Julia.
      **Julia:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Listen, I, uh... I'm sorry the two of us got off to a bit of a
             frosty start, but, uh, I think that in time we will have a very
             long and rewarding relationship.
      **Julia:**[_dismissively_] Okay. 
    
    [_She returns to what she was doing, intending to send Frasier a "signal."_]
    
    **Frasier:** May I tell you a story?
    
    [_Julia sighs, but feigns interest._]
    
    **Frasier:** Years ago, I lived in Boston.  I was in private practice then
             and my life was very good.  And then my wife left me.  I ended
             up on a ledge, threatening to-to throw myself off if she didn't
             return to me.
    
    [_The waiter brings Julia's coffee.  She is only half listening to Frasier._]
    
      **Julia:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** Well, this got on the news, of course, and needless to say,
             after that, patients were a little hard to come by.  So... I
             just wanted you to know that I too have suffered a very
             public setback.
      **Julia:**[_sarcastically_] Oh, I get it.  You're letting me know I'm not
             alone.
    **Frasier:** Exactly.
      **Julia:**[_disdainfully_] And now we can be friends.
    **Frasier:**[_smiling, not picking up her signals_] Well, if that's how
             you feel.
      **Julia:** Let's see, how do I feel?  Well, it's sort of like on your
             show when you call people at home to give them advice.
    **Frasier:**[_not recognizing the sarcasm_] Well, actually, I don't call
             them, they call me.
      **Julia:**[_bitingly_] Exactly! 
    
    [_She grins evilly at him and goes back to her coffee._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_rising, attempting to preserve some dignity_] Well.  Good
             day, then.
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 3 - Frasier's apartment.
    Daphne and Martin are seated at the dinner table over breakfast._]
    
     **Martin:** Why would you let Niles bring all his patients to your home?
     **Daphne:** It's only a couple more weeks until his office is finished.
     **Martin:** Well, I sure wouldn't want to have all those crazies over.  I
             mean, what if one of them starts screaming obscenities or
             running through the house naked.
     **Daphne:** Mum already did that when England lost in the World Cup.
    
    [_Frasier and Niles enter and hang up their coats._]
    
      **Niles:** Hello all.
     **Martin:** Hey.
     **Daphne:** Hello.  How was the Wine Expo?
    **Frasier:** Horrible!
      **Niles:** Frasier ran into a fan.
     **Martin:** Ow, that smarts!
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad.  You have been using that same old joke for the last
             ten years.  So, anyway, I ran into this fan...
     **Martin:** Ouch!  Are you okay?
    
    [_Frasier glares at him.  He pours some wine glasses._]
    
    **Frasier:** So this woman complimented me on my so-called chemistry with
             that harpy Julia.  Have you ever heard anything more preposterous?
             Good Lord!  The woman sneezed once, and I said "Bless you."
             That has been the extent of our byplay.
     **Daphne:** You've been complaining about her so much lately.  I'm beginning
             to wonder if there's not something deeper there.
    **Frasier:** I will not even dignify that with a response. [_pausing, handing
             Niles a wine glass_] Except to say that you couldn't be more
             wrong.
      **Niles:** I don't know, Frasier, she's certainly attractive.  And she's
             intelligent, ambitious, tenacious...
     **Daphne:** Sounds like your perfect woman.
    **Frasier:** She is a cold, insufferable know-it-all!
     **Daphne:** And the list goes on and on.
    **Frasier:**[_sitting_] All right, that's it.  No more talking about Julia.
     **Daphne:**[_teasing, approaching Frasier_] Ooh, so it's "Julia" now!
    
    [_Niles and Martin respond with similar "Ooh's._]
    
    **Frasier:** It has always been "Julia."  That is her name.
      **Niles:** She does seem to have you disproportionately upset.  You
             haven't been so consumed with one subject since Frasier Crane
             Day.
    **Frasier:** Listen, my outrage is completely merited.  That woman is
             deliberately trying to undermine my show from within.  I'm
             sorry to disappoint all of you, but I have absolutely no
             feelings for that woman except contempt.
     **Martin:** There he goes again.  You know what they say about people who
             protest too much?
    **Frasier:** I know what you used to say: "They should all be tear-gassed!"
    
    [_Frasier exits angrily toward his room.  Martin frowns philosophically._]
    
     **Martin:** I still think that, you know.
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 4 - A conference room at KACL.
    Julia is seated at a table.  Frasier enters._]
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, here you are.  Listen... it's time the two of us had it out.
             Ever since you arrived here, you have been nothing but
             condescending and dismissive.
      **Julia:** Whatever.
    **Frasier:** There, you did it again.
      **Julia:** You know what this is really about.  It's about you losing
             fifteen minutes from your precious show.
    **Frasier:** What are you talking about?  It's ten minutes.
      **Julia:** Sorry, starting Monday I do the last fifteen minutes of your
             show with a half-hour recap on Fridays.  Now, if you'll excuse
             me, I have places to be. [_She begins to put away her papers._]
    **Frasier:** No, I will not excuse you.  I am reaching out to you here.
      **Julia:** Yeah, will you cut that out?  It's like you're trying to make
             me your special project.  Why don't you just adopt a cat or
             something?
    **Frasier:**[_seething_] As your colleague, I do not deserve to be treated
             this way.
      **Julia:** Oh, no.  We are hardly "colleagues."  I deliver the news and
             you're a... Magic Eight Ball with a Harvard degree. [_She rises._]
    **Frasier:**[_rising, horrified and deeply offended_] I will not be belittled
             by a half-educated, money-grubbing parvenu!
      **Julia:** As opposed to some foreign-speaking windbag?
    **Frasier:** That makes you an insecure fraud!
      **Julia:** You are a pompous blowhard!
    
    [_At this point, Kenny is visible looking inside the window of the door._]
    
    **Frasier:** Harridan!
      **Julia:** Know-it-all!
    **Frasier:** Shrew!
      **Julia:** Snob!
    **Frasier:**[_lightly grabbing her arms_] Are you as turned on as I am?
      **Julia:**[_visibly shocked_] What?!  Oh!! [_throwing off his hands_] Did
             you just come on to me?
    **Frasier:** What?  No... No... I thought... I thought that you... [_He is
             deeply embarrassed and at a loss for words._]
      **Julia:** Oh!  How could you think I was turned on?  What, are you sick?
    
    [_Kenny rushes in the room._]
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Let's all calm down here. [_To Frasier_]
             Are you crazy?
    **Frasier:** I apologized!  I... I...
      **Julia:**[_leaving the room, utterly disgusted_] Blech!!
    
    [_Kenny stares at Frasier and gestures as if to say "Now, what?"  Fade out._]
    
    [_NB: This exchange pays a tongue-in-cheek homage to two very famous
    events in Frasier/Cheers lore.  
    
    When Sam and Diane first came together on "Cheers," they were engaged in 
    a heated argument with explosive passions.  Sam asked the same question 
    as Frasier, and Diane responded with "More!"  Their first intensely 
    passionate kiss followed.  
    
    The scene is also overtly reminiscent of the Season Three episode[[3.06] "Sleeping With the Enemy"](/frasier/transcripts/season_3/episode_6/sleeping_with_the_enemy.html), where a very similar argument at 
    the station between Frasier and Kate Costas ended with a very 
    different outcome._]
    
    _END OF ACT I
    
    
    ACT II_
    
    [_Scene 5 - KACL hallway.
    Frasier approaches a group including Noel and Gil._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hi, guys!
    
    [_All except Noel turn up their chins and walk away._]
    
     **Noel:** Oh, hi, Dr. Crane...!
    
    [_He is interrupted by Gil, who grabs him.  Noel joins the snubbing
    and walks away, leaving Frasier with Kenny._]
    
    **Frasier:** They hate me, don't they?
      **Kenny:** Can you blame them?  Because of you, they have to come in here
             for this sexual harassment seminar.
    **Frasier:**[_sighing_] I know.  I have apologized till I'm blue in the face.
      **Kenny:** I know.  But Legal wants us covered in case Julia tries to come
             after us.  Maybe you've heard: she loves suing people's asses
             off.  I'm going to miss saying "asses."  After today, I guess
             it's back to "patootie."  Thanks a lot, Doc.
    
    [_They enter a seminar room, where the group leader is seated at a table
    covered with brochures._]
    
    **Van:** Hi, welcome.  Please take a workbook.
    
    [_Frasier does so, sighing wearily.  Others now enter.  Frasier sits next
    to Roz._]
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier!  Thanks for ruining my weekend.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz... come on, you know it was just a mistake.  What do
             you think I am, some kind of disgusting Lothario?
    **Bulldog:**[_entering on cue_] Hey, there's my man!
        **Van:** Welcome.  Please take a workbook.
    **Bulldog:**[_pulling one from his pocket_] Got an old one. [_approaching
             Frasier_] Hey!  I know you're down.  Don't sweat it.  Rookie
             mistake.  By the way, the chick at the coffee table's got
             her high beams on. [_He barks._]
    
    [_Julia enters, grabs the workbook, and pauses to glare at Frasier.  She
    takes a seat next to Bulldog, who ogles her with a grin.  Julia glares
    back at him.  Kenny goes to the front of the group._]
    
      **Kenny:** Okay, people let's get this started. Uh, first of all, I
             apologize for bringing everyone in here today, but uh, to
             make it up to you, everybody attending today will get a free
             mouse pad.  How's that?
        **Roz:** It sucks!
      **Kenny:** All right, who said that?
        **Roz:** I did!
      **Kenny:** Fair enough.  Now, I don't want to blame anyone...
    
    [_At this point, Bulldog sneezes out a name while covering his mouth.
    The captions say that he sneezes "Julia," but I am quite sure that it
    is actually "Frasier" that Bulldog says and means.  Julia again glares
    at him._]
    
      **Kenny:**...but Legal says that we have to do this, so here's Van Andrews
             from Harassment Solutions.
    
    [_Van, a balding, Noel-like individual, takes his place before the group._]
    
        **Van:** Okay, guys.  I'm Van.  I'll be your facilitator, and if you could
             just open up your workbooks, we'll get started on building a
             truly gender-neutral workplace, okay?  Now, who wants to meet my
             puppets?
    
    [_He pulls out two hand dolls dressed in "workplace attire," male and female.
    Everyone groans.  Gil stares angrily at Frasier.  He makes a poorly-formed
    fist and hits his other hand with it.  Frasier is not sure how to react.
    Fade out._]
    
    **THERE'S A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE**
    
    [_Scene 6 - Niles's apartment.
    He is in a therapy session with Steve, a patient._]
    
      **Steve:** Wow, this is great!  I like coming over to your house.  It's
             really nice.
      **Niles:** Thanks.
      **Steve:** So, maybe you could come over to my house next week, since
             we're doing stuff at each other's houses now.
      **Niles:** Uh, thanks for the offer, Steve, but this isn't a social call.
             We're having our regular session.  I really want this to feel
             just like the office.
      **Steve:** Okay, uh, well, I've been having my dream again...
    
    [_He is interrupted by a knock._]
    
      **Niles:** Yes?
    
    [_A plumber enters._]
    
    **Plumber:** Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Crane, but I've got to run these toilet
             fixtures past you.  Your wife said you'd definitely want to be
             consulted about that.
      **Steve:** I never pictured you having a bathroom!
      **Niles:**[_becoming visibly uncomfortable_] Uh, it isn't a good time.
    
    [_Daphne enters._]
    
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, I didn't realize your session had begun. [_to the
             plumber_] Why don't you just start in the living room?
    **Plumber:** Okay, but just so you know, the heated seat you want's on
             back order [_he exits_].
     **Daphne:** Again, I'm sorry, Niles, but while I have you here, do you
             want anything from the shops?
      **Niles:** No, I'm good.
     **Daphne:** Okay, then, I'm off. [_She smiles at Steve._] Happy therapy!
             [_As she exits, she looks at Steve suspiciously._]
      **Niles:**[_clearing his throat_] So, back to your dream...
      **Steve:** Your wife seems nice.  She's foreign.  That's weird.  But
             then I guess it shouldn't be.  I mean it only makes sense
             that you have a wife, and a bathroom, and you probably have
             a bed and laundry and that thing I can't talk about.
      **Niles:** Refrigerator.
      **Steve:** Right.
      **Niles:** Okay, well, we're not really here to learn about my life, we're
             here to talk about you, so back to your dream.
      **Steve:** Okay, um, well, I'm in this forest...
    
    [_The telephone rings._]
    
      **Steve:** Do you want to get that, or...?
      **Niles:** No, nope it's okay, the machine will get it.  Now remember, as
             we discussed, the forest could be a symbol of uncharted
             territory.  It could be...
    
    [_The machine now answers the phone.  The answering message plays.  
    In it, Niles and Daphne, to the tune of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, 
    sing: "Nobody's home.  Nobody's home.  Nobody's home, nobody's home, 
    nobody's home.  Nobody's home, nobody's home, nobody's home.  We'll 
    call you back if you leave your number after you hear the..." 
    
    The recording beep then sounds.  Niles, giving up, cues the beep 
    with his hand.  Steve is delighted with the message._]
    
      **Niles:**[_smiling uncomfortably_] So, um, next week at your place!
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 7 - KACL conference room.
    The seminar is well underway.  Bulldog and Roz are seated facing each
    other at the front._]
    
        **Van:** Okay, Bulldog, in this exercise we're going to pretend that you
             have an attraction to Roz.  Is that okay?
    **Bulldog:**[_playing along_] Well, Van, I feel a little uncomfortable about
             violating her personal space, even for role playing, but... okay.
    
    [_He winks at Frasier, who reacts knowingly._]
    
        **Van:** Okay, Roz.
        **Roz:**[_with a deep voice, making a gesture_] Bring it on!
        **Van:** Okay, go!
    **Bulldog:** Good morning, Roz.  You're looking professional today.
        **Roz:** Thank you, Bulldog, you're looking professional today also.
    **Bulldog:** Thank you.  After work, would you care to join me for a coffee
             or non-stimulating beverage?  Please note that you retain the
             option to say no.
        **Van:** Excellent, Bulldog.  Roz?
        **Roz:** Thank you, Bulldog, for your offer, but I'm uncomfortable with
             it, as I would prefer to cut my own arm off and eat it.
       **Noel:**[_rising_] Can I have a turn with her?
    **Bulldog:** Nope, sorry buddy.
       **Noel:** She's not your property.  It's up to Van!  I want a turn!
    **Bulldog:** Sit down, Noel. [_Noel approaches him._]  Oh, what are you going
             to do, huh?  What are you going to do?
    
    [_Noel confronts Bulldog as menacingly as he can._]
    
        **Van:** Guys, guys, let's keep our dialogue constructive, okay.
             I think we're done here.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, great.
        **Van:** Why don't you go ahead and... have a seat.
    
    [_Bulldog, Noel, and Roz return to their seats.  Gil raises his hand._]
    
        **Gil:** Um, I'd like to say something.
        **Van:** Okay, go ahead, Gil.
    
    [_Gil rises and moves to the front.  He speaks after a dramatic pause._]
    
        **Gil:** From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for my wandering eye
             over the years.  Those whom I mentally undressed, and... you know
             who you are... [_a man and woman look at each other; it is clear
             that no person of either gender really knows whether or not Gil
             has mentally undressed them_] ...all I can say - and it's a poor
             defense - is that I was a product of the thoughtless machismo
             of my times.
        **Van:** Thank you, Gil.
        **Gil:** But know this: Gil isn't about to stop loving the ladies.
    
    [_Frasier and Roz exchange a look._]
    
        **Van:** Thank you, Gil.  I think they like to be called "women" now.
        **Gil:** Huh.  Do they ever!
    
    [_Gil returns to his seat.  Frasier stares at him incredulously.  
    His patience has run out._]
    
    **Frasier:** How much longer do we have to sit for this nonsense?
        **Van:** Well, Frasier, since you're the one who brought us here
             today, maybe you'd like to take a turn in the warm seat,
             hmm?
    
    [_Frasier reluctantly rises._]
      
        **Van:** Julia, would you be comfortable in helping Frasier learn how
             he could have related to you in a more office-appropriate
             manner? [_Julia is staring down, paying no attention._]  Uh,
             Julia?
       **Noel:**[_rising_] She's playing solitaire on her palm pilot, Van.
      **Julia:** Oh, all right.
    
    [_She stares at Noel and takes a seat opposite Frasier._]
    
        **Van:** Okay, in this "no-fault" rewind, let's find out how Frasier
             assaulted you.
    **Frasier:** I did not assault her.  I simply expressed unhappiness that
             she was taking fifteen minutes from my show.  She responded
             by belittling my profession.
      **Julia:**[_deadpan_] And then he called me a couple of names and asked
             if I was turned on.
        **Van:** Okay, gang, where did Frasier go wrong?
    
    [_Everybody eagerly raises their hands, murmuring and snapping fingers._]
    
        **Van:** Uh, Bulldog?
    **Bulldog:** People stopped saying "turned on" twenty years ago.
    
    [_N.B.: Another inside reference to the "Cheers" exchange, which really did
    take place about twenty years ago._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_after everybody again eagerly raises their hands_] No, look,
             look!  I just misread her... her signals.  I thought that her
             hostility was displaced attraction.
      **Julia:** No, it was just hostility.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course it was, that's all there is to you.  Ever since
             you arrived at this station we have reached out to you in 
             friendship and all we've gotten in return is arrogance and
             unbridled rudeness.
      **Julia:** It's not rudeness, it's indifference.  I'm sorry I'm not
             joining your bowling team, but this is just a pit stop for
             me.  I do not intend on spending the rest of my life at a
             station that cuts out whenever the janitor vacuums!
    
    [_Roz is clearly somewhat hurt by this comment, as is everyone else._]
    
      **Julia:** No offense!
      **Kenny:**[_smiling stupidly_] None taken.
      **Julia:** And I don't even know why we're here.  I'm not going to sue
             your stupid station, I mean, how pathetic would that look?
    **Frasier:**[_rising angrily_] How dare you?  At KACL, we are a family.
             Every person in this room respects one another...
      **Kenny:** No, no, no, hold on a second, Doc, I'll handle this. [_to Julia_]
             You mentioned something about not suing us.  Would you put that
             in writing?
      **Julia:** If it gets us out of here.
      **Kenny:** Sure, that should satisfy Legal.
    
    [_Everybody exits, happily murmuring._]
    
        **Van:** Okay, wait, wait.  This course isn't about Legal!  Okay, it's
             about making respecting each other's personhood fun.
        **Roz:** Up yours!
        **Van:** Who said that?
        **Roz:** I did!
    
    [_Van follows everyone else out of the room, leaving Frasier and Julia
    alone._]
    
    **Frasier:** You know, you can act as tough as you want, but I see through
             you.
      **Julia:** Really?
    **Frasier:** You're not in the big leagues anymore.  Blame it on the market.
             Blame it on bad luck.  But somewhere in the back of your head
             is that nagging voice that keeps saying maybe you weren't good
             enough. 
    
    [_Julia's look expresses that Frasier's words are true._]
    
    **Frasier:** And now that you're here, you won't form relationships, you keep
             everybody at arm's length, anything to convince yourself that
             this is just a stop along the way.  And above it all, I think 
             you're terrified that you're going to fail here too.  Then what
             do I know?  I'm just a Magic Eight Ball with a Harvard... and
             _Oxford_ degree.
             
    [_Julia is clearly sobered by his obviously accurate assessment.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 8 - KACL studio.
    Frasier is finishing his show._]
    
    **Frasier:** It's forty-five past the hour, which means it's time once again for the
             woman who... [_Julia clears her throat_] ...is known as Julia Wilcox.
      **Julia:** Thank you, Frasier.  Another up day for the markets, but first
             these words from Patriot Credit Consolidators.
    
    [_Roz enters with copy for Julia._]
    
      **Julia:** How many times do I have to tell you, you need to get a
             comfortable chair in here?  My leg keeps falling asleep while
             I'm on the air.
        **Roz:** Who doesn't? [_She heads back to her booth._]
      **Julia:**[_making peace_] Frasier... perhaps if you're at Nervosa later,
             I could join you for a cup of coffee or a non-stimulating
             beverage? [_nervously_] Please note that you retain the option
             to say no.
    **Frasier:** I appreciate that, and in time I believe that we will be able
             to establish a collegial relationship.  However, I think we
             should both acknowledge the feelings of hostility that remain
             between us...
      **Julia:**[_her old self_] Oh, just say no.  Honestly, do you ever shut up?
    **Frasier:** Now, see here, I...
    
    [_Julia begins her report again, but smiles and waves at Frasier as she does so, 
    who smiles back as he exits.  There is an understanding between them, 
    and everything will be all right._]
    
      **Julia:** The rich got richer today on Wall Street.  Not news ordinarily,
             but after their recent slide, today's rally in large cap does
             take on a certain "man bites dog" quality.  Speaking of dogs...
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits**
    Roz brings two cups of coffee to Julia.  She takes one and heads to her
    booth.  She pauses to pick up the phone, and sets the cup down again.  
    Julia switches the cups while she is not looking.  Roz turns and nearly
    catches her.  Kenny looks into the studio, and Julia turns away,
    whereupon Roz again switches the cups.  Julia looks back suspiciously
    at Roz, and suggests that they again switch cups, which they do.
    Neither of them now knows which up is which, so Roz takes them both and
    dumps them out.
