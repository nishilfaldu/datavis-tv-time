    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa
    Fade in.  
    Roz and Frasier are drinking coffee at a table.
    _
        **Roz:** Well I suppose you looked in the classifieds under 
             "Housekeepers"?
    **Frasier:** Check.
        **Roz:** And you asked people in your building...
    **Frasier:** Check.
        **Roz:** And you called the employment agencies?
    **Frasier:** Again, check.
    _A waiter comes and slaps their check on the table._
     **Waiter:**[_snidely_] I heard you the first time.
    _He stalks off._
        **Roz:** Who thought it'd be so hard to get to find someone to clean 
             your house?
    **Frasier:** Well, over the years Daphne's managed to scour her way into
             our hearts, so to speak.  And I just don't want to hire 
             someone who's only in it for the money.
        **Roz:** So you want to find someone who's in it for the joy of 
             cleaning?
    _Gil Chesterton walks over to their table._
    [_N.B. This is Gil's first appearance after being absent through the 
    whole of Season Nine._]
    
        **Gil:** Ah, may I?
    **Frasier:** Of course, Gil.
        **Roz:** Take a load off.
    _He sits._
        **Gil:** Oh, nice outfit, Roz.  Somehow you and a peasant blouse just 
             seem to go together.
        **Roz:**[_rising_] Thanks.  Haven't worn it for years.  I mean, how long
             can something stay in the closet?
    _She leaves._
    **Frasier:** Say, uh, Gil, are you pleased with your housekeeper?
        **Gil:** Oh, you mean Chung?
    **Frasier:** Mm-hmm.
        **Gil:** Oh yes, he's marvelous.  He's efficient, he's dependable and 
             he still hasn't figured out American money.  Between you and
             me, I told him when they made Lincoln's picture bigger it
             was worth more.
    **Frasier:** Very funny.  Do you suppose that your Man Friday might be
             available on a Monday or a Tuesday?
        **Gil:** You want to steal my Chung!
    **Frasier:** No, no.  Not steal him, just, just borrow him for a day or
             two a week until I can re-staff.
        **Gil:** Oh, a dangerous notion, Frasier.  You know how employees 
             gossip about their benefactors.
    **Frasier:** Well, I have nothing to hide.
        **Gil:** Yes, but suppose while on your premises he lets something slip 
             about me and Deb and our heart-shaped bed?
    **Frasier:** I would refuse to believe him.
        **Gil:** Did I mention he's a drug mule?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he is not!  You're just saying that because you don't want
             to help me out!
        **Gil:** Oh, such insight.  It's a pity more people don't listen to
             your show.
    _He gets up and leaves as Frasier sits, fuming.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  
    Frasier is escorting an applicant to the door.  Martin and Daphne are 
    on chairs._
    **Frasier:** Thank you for coming, Mrs. Wilkins.  Of course, we have 
             several other candidates to interview, but I'll be sure 
             to let you know by the twelfth.
    _She leaves and he closes the door behind her._
    **Frasier:**...of Never!  Honestly, I'm beginning to wonder if we'll ever
              find anyone that meets our standards.
    _He sits on the couch._
     **Martin:** You're being too picky.  It's just housekeeping, not rocket
             science.
     **Daphne:** I beg to differ.  You don't even know half of what I used to
             do around here.  Like dusting the plant leaves or rotating
             your underwear.
     **Martin:** Excuse me?
     **Daphne:** Every month I used to throw out your oldest pair and put in
             two new pairs.  Did it ever occur to you that you didn't have
             to buy underwear in ten years?
     **Martin:** Thought I got hold of a good batch.
    **Frasier:** Now let's see, who is our front runner thus far?
     **Martin:** Oh, I don't know, they're all the same to me.
    **Frasier:** Honestly, Dad, I am starting to get the slightest bit chaffed
             with your attitude.  You haven't even graded any of the
             candidates, you've simply doodled a war plane dropping bombs
             on a soldier.
     **Martin:** That's not a soldier.
    _The doorbell rings and Frasier goes to answer._
    **Frasier:** Well, then why is he wearing a helmet?
     **Martin:** It's not a helmet.  It's someone with a big head!
    _Frasier gives him a dark look.  He then opens the door to reveal the
    next applicant._
    **Frasier:** Yes?
      **Trish:** Hi, I'm Trish Haney, I'm here about the housekeeper job?  
             I'm really sorry I'm late.
    **Frasier:** I had you down for over an hour ago.
      **Trish:** I know.  I got stuck in line waiting to buy tickets to the
             Sonics game this weekend.
    _Martin perks up at this._
     **Martin:** Really?  Come on in!
      **Trish:** I should have guessed everyone and his brother would want to
             see Vince Carter play.
     **Martin:** Not everybody.  Or his brother.
      **Trish:** Wow, this is a beautiful place.  Here's my resume.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  Won't you be seated.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, this
             is my father Martin Crane and this is my sister-in-law Daphne
             Crane.  Now, I'll get right to the interview.  First question: 
             What is the best way to combat rings on a wooden table?
      **Trish:** Um, I heard you can rub mayonnaise on it.
    **Frasier:** The best way is to provide coasters.  An ounce of prevention
             is worth a pound of cure.
      **Trish:**[_smiling_] Started me out with a trick question.  Right.
     **Martin:** So, how do you think the Sonics will defend Carter?
      **Trish:** Um, you have to have someone body up on him and then double
             team when he gets the ball.
     **Martin:** Thank you.
     **Daphne:** Trish, if the washing machine has a twenty-five minute cycle,
             and the dryer has a forty minute cycle, what time does the
             second load have to go in the washer to be done by five
             o'clock?
      **Trish:** Uh, well, that's sixty-five minutes, so 3:55.
     **Daphne:** You may want to take some time to think about these questions
             before...
    **Frasier:** Daphne, she's right.
     **Daphne:**[_taken aback_] Well done.
     **Martin:** Hey, I got a question: Can you clean a house?
      **Trish:** Yes, and if I do say so myself, I'm pretty good.
     **Martin:** Next question: Can you start Monday?
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] Well, we're getting just a bit ahead of ourselves.  
             We still have several people to meet.
    _He rises and leads Trish out._
    **Frasier:** Thank you for coming by.
      **Trish:** Oh, sure.  That was the interview, huh?  Two questions.
    **Frasier:** Well, it was really more of a pre-screening.  We'll be sure
             to let you know.
      **Trish:** Oh, just to let you know, I'll be out of town until the first.
    **Frasier:** Fine, then I'll be sure to call you the second.
    _He closes the door after her._
    **Frasier:**...I lose my mind!
     **Martin:** What?  What was wrong with her?
    **Frasier:** In the first place, she showed up late.  She doesn't take the
             interview seriously, how can we expect her to take the job
             seriously?
     **Martin:** Oh, you just don't like her because she's not all stuffy.
     **Daphne:** She did seem a bit cheeky.
     **Martin:** Which YOU never were.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm afraid so far our best candidate is the young man
             from Jeepers Sweepers.
    _Daphne gets up and starts cleaning the table._
     **Martin:** I will move out if you hire that prancing moron.
    **Frasier:** All right, fine.  Who would you hire?  This, this Trish, 
             I suppose.
     **Martin:** Well, I was right about Daphne.  Doesn't that count for
             anything?  You didn't even want to hire her, you thought 
             she might steal.
    _Daphne looks up, incensed.  Frasier looks guilty._
     **Daphne:** Did you really say that?!
    **Frasier:** Of course not!  I don't remember.
    _He sits back down on the couch._
     **Martin:** Well whoever gets hired is someone I'm gonna have to spend
             a lot of time with, and I don't need a lot of quiz questions
             and score sheets to get a feel for someone's character.
     **Daphne:** Did I look like a thief?  Was it me shifty eyes?
     **Martin:** Look, if you don't trust my judgment, Frasier, just have the
             guts to say so.
    **Frasier:** You know, all right, fine.  You can hire whoever you want to.
             You want this Trish, fine, call her.
     **Martin:** Right.  I'll call her right now and tell her she's hired.
     **Daphne:** And I'll tell her where you keep your valuables.
    **Frasier:** Oh, would you give it a rest?!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Cafe Nervosa
    Fade in.
    Roz is at a table, ordering, and Niles is just coming in.
    _
        **Roz:** Hey, Niles, have a seat.
      **Niles:** Oh, thank you.
    _He sits._
      **Niles:**[_to waiter_] I'll have my usual.  Oh no, bottled water, 
             room temperature.
    _The waiter heads off._
        **Roz:** Gee, slow down, little man, what are we celebrating?
      **Niles:** I can't drink anything that's too hot, I have a toothache.
        **Roz:** Oh.  You been to the dentist?
      **Niles:** Yes.  He said the tooth is perfectly healthy but I still have
             this throbbing pain.  I think I may have to go to the doctor.
        **Roz:** Oh, it's probably just a sinus infection.  Have you had a cold
             lately?
      **Niles:** Couple of weeks ago, yes, but I'm over it.
        **Roz:** That's probably what it is, a sinus infection.  Happens to me
             all the time.
    _The waiter brings their drinks._
      **Niles:** In all likelihood, I'm sure you're right.  Thank you.
        **Roz:** Of course I'm right.  What else could it be?
      **Niles:** Actually a toothache can be referred pain from something else.
        **Roz:** "Referred pain."
      **Niles:** That's right.  For example, if I had a heart condition, 
             I might not have pain in my chest, I might have pain in 
             my tooth.  You see, referred pain.  So while you're probably 
             right about the sinus infection, let's not discount the one 
             in ten thousand chance that it might be something more 
             serious.
    _He opens his water._
        **Roz:** Oh, now I get it.  So the pain in my butt might actually be
             coming from across the table.
      **Niles:** Something like that, yes. [_He glances at the bottle top._] Oh
             look!  I'm the winner of a fanny pack.
        **Roz:** Congratulations.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
        **Roz:** You have no idea what it is, do you?
      **Niles:** Not really, no.
    _She grabs the bottle._
        **Roz:** Hey, look: it says here the odds of winning it are one in ten
             thousand.  Ooh, spooky.  Same odds as that toothache being a
             heart attack.  Maybe it's a sign.
      **Niles:** It's a good sign.  By beating those odds once it makes it that
             much more unlikely that something so improbable can happen to
             me again.
    _A woman enters._
      **Woman:** Niles!
    _Niles gets up, but it is not his wife.  The woman crosses over to
    another table where a young man rises to greet her._
    **Other Niles:** Hello, Daphne.
    _Niles stares at them as they sit, then slowly sits himself._
      **Niles:** Okay, that's weird.
    _FADE TO:_
    **IN STREET JARGON,
    HE'S KNOW AS "THE MARK"**
    _Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  
    Martin is showing Trish around._
     **Martin:** So, that's the grand tour.
      **Trish:** Hard to know where to start.  I don't have much time before
             I have to go.
     **Martin:** What?  You leavin' already?
      **Trish:** Yeah, I have this lunch thing.  I hope you don't mind.
     **Martin:** Well...
      **Trish:** The problem is, it's this friend that I've been putting off
             because I've been too busy, but now I finally don't have any
             excuse.  We're gonna try that new rib place down in Bell Town.
     **Martin:** Oh, I hear that's great.
      **Trish:** Yeah, I can bring you back a great big bag of them.  But
             enough chit chat, I've got dishes to do.
     **Martin:** Hold on, can I offer a suggestion?
      **Trish:** You're the boss.
     **Martin:** What Daphne did was put a load of laundry in first and that
             way you can do two things at once.
      **Trish:** Okay.  Although I prefer to do laundry at the end of the day,
             and that way I can read when the clothes are in the dryer.
             I mean it's about the only "me time" I have on this job.
    _She heads for the bedrooms.  Niles and Daphne come in the front._
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad, ready for breakfast?
     **Martin:** Well, thanks for the invite, but I can't go.
      **Niles:** Well, we didn't invite you.  You called us and badgered us
             until we rearranged our schedule.
     **Martin:** Well, that was before Trish came.  I really think I should
             hang around and show her the ropes.
     **Daphne:** Maybe you should show her where the room freshener is.  
             It smells like stale cigars in here.
    _She starts picking a few things up._
     **Martin:** Yeah, I had some of the guys in last night for poker.  Oh, 
             hey!  Niles, check this out.  I've got a great new card trick.
    _He grabs a deck of cards._
      **Niles:**[_resigned_] Oh, goody.
     **Martin:** Yeah, it's called "The Amazing Niles."  Or "The Amazing..."
             whoever you're doing the trick with.  Like, if I was doing it
             with Daphne, it'd be "The Amazing Daphne."  Or if I was doing
             it with Frasier, it'd be...
      **Niles:** "The Amazing Frasier", yeah, I get it, Dad.
     **Martin:** Yeah.  That's just my patter. 
    _He fans the cards and holds them out._
     **Martin:** Okay, Amazing Niles, I want you to draw the ace of spades out 
             of this deck.
      **Niles:**[_humoring him_] Ah, something tells me that it's going to be
             this one right here.
    _He pulls a card then turns it over to show that it is the ace of 
    spades._
     **Martin:** Ladies and gentlemen, he drew the ace of spades!
     **Daphne:** Amazing, Amazing Niles.
    _She picks a deck off of the table._
     **Martin:** Isn't that a great trick?
     **Daphne:** Hey, wait a minute.  How come this deck only has aces of 
             spades?
     **Martin:** What?  No, THIS is the trick...
    _He run through the cards in his hands, stunned._
     **Martin:** Wait a minute, this isn't the trick deck.  Holy cow!
      **Niles:** What?
     **Martin:** You just drew the card I asked you for.  What are the odds?
             I wonder if you can do it again.
    _He fans the cards out to an increasingly nervous Niles._
      **Niles:** No, no.  Only one performance a day.
    _He puts his fingers to his neck to check his pulse._
     **Daphne:** Is something wrong?
      **Niles:** What?  No.  You know, since we're not going to have breakfast,
             maybe we should go.
     **Daphne:** All right.  That way we can pick up your car from the shop.
     **Martin:** What happened to your car?
      **Niles:**[_quietly_] Got struck by lightning.
    _They leave, Trish comes back into the living room._
      **Trish:** Okay, washer's running as we speak.  Anything else before I
             go?
     **Martin:** You're going to lunch now?  It's only ten.
      **Trish:** Already?  Ugh, I guess the dishes'll have to wait.  I've got
             a couple of errands to run and then I have a hair appointment.
     **Martin:** Trish, I'm a little surprised that you're takin' off like
             this.
      **Trish:** Yeah.  I'm a little surprised too.  I thought my first day
             would be more like orientation, you know?  Show me around,
             explain my duties, and then I start work the next day.
     **Martin:** Why would you think that?
      **Trish:** It's been that way every other place I've worked.  And I've
             had a lot of jobs.
     **Martin:** Well, listen Trish, I kinda went out on a limb for you and
             I'll never hear the end of it from my son if you let me down.
      **Trish:** Don't worry, you are not gonna regret hiring me.  Tomorrow
             morning, I'll be like the White Tornado.  Remember those
             commercials, the White Tornado?  That'll be me, ten o'clock.
     **Martin:** So, you're not comin' back after lunch?
      **Trish:** Oh, trust me, you don't want me cleaning this place drunk.
             And that reminds me, I don't work Mondays.  Gosh, you know,
             I better get going.  If I'm late to this lunch, how's that
             gonna look?
     **Martin:** Well, what about the laundry?
      **Trish:** Oh, ten o'clock tomorrow.  Along with those ribs.
    _She leaves.  Frasier comes in from his room._
    **Frasier:** Well, I hear the washer going.  I assume that means our new
             employee is hard at it.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, she's like the White Tornado.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know your basketball references go right over my
             head.  You know, she's certainly got her work cut out for
             her, cleaning up this mess you and your buddies made last
             night.
     **Martin:** Well, you don't have to worry about it, she's all about the
             work.
    **Frasier:** Listen, Dad, I think I owe you an apology.
     **Martin:** For what?
    **Frasier:** Well, for thinking I was a better judge of people than you
             are.  I just want you to know that I do trust your judgment.
             Maybe I don't say that often enough.  Anyway, I hope you can
             forgive me.
    _He heads for the door._
     **Martin:** There's nothing to forgive, Son.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.  I'll see you later.
    _He leaves.  Eddie comes in and jumps on the arm of Martin's chair, 
    a toy in his mouth._
     **Martin:**[_getting up_] Not now, boy.  We've got an apartment to clean.
    _FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa_
    Fade in.  
    Roz is sitting at the window table, reading a magazine.  Niles comes 
    in, looking desperate.
    _
        **Roz:** Hi, Niles.  How's it goin'?
      **Niles:** I'm as good as dead! [_sitting_] I've been doing research into
             my family health history: my great-uncle Timothy keeled over
             from a heart attack at my age.
    _As the waiter walks by, Niles grabs his arm._
      **Niles:**[_urgently_] Bottled water.  Please.
    _The waiter walks off, a disturbed look on his face._
        **Roz:** Are you talking about that tooth again?
      **Niles:** It's still throbbing, thank you!  Which means my heart is
             probably on its last legs.
        **Roz:** Come on, Niles, you said it was a one in a million chance.
      **Niles:** One in ten thousand.  And I've been beating those odds all
             week.  I don't believe in omens, but these are getting harder
             and harder to ignore.
        **Roz:** So are you.
    _She goes back to her magazine._
      **Niles:** I flipped a coin seventeen times last night and every time 
             it came up tails!  I only stopped because I was getting a 
             blister.
    _The waiter sets his water down._
      **Niles:** Thank you.
        **Roz:** How does Daphne put up with all this?
      **Niles:** I haven't told her about it.  Because, unlike you, she'd worry
             about me.
    _He opens his water._
        **Roz:** Get your heart checked.  And stop obsessing about it.
      **Niles:** I'm going to.  In all probability, there's a perfectly
             reasonable expla...
    _Glancing at the bottle cap, he drops it and pulls back with a gasp of
    shock._
        **Roz:** What?
      **Niles:** I won another fanny pack!
    _He sits frozen as Roz checks the cap.

    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  
    Martin is mopping the floor just inside the front door, the phone 
    pressed to his ear._
     **Martin:** No, I'm not mad at you, Trish, I'm just a little disappointed.
             Well, yesterday was your neighbor's funeral and today you
             got the flu.  No, I kinda believe you, but you know this
             apartment doesn't clean itself, so... huh?  Okay.  Tomorrow,
             nine sharp.  Ten?  Okay.  I'll see you when you get here.
    _He hears the key in the lock and quickly puts the mop in the powder
    room.  Frasier comes in, dropping his wet galoshes and struggling with
    his dripping umbrella._
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake!
     **Martin:** Hey, careful there mister.  You're gonna get water all over
             the clean floor.
    **Frasier:** Well, maybe you can have Trish wax this floor tomorrow.
     **Martin:** She already did.  It took her two hours.  And it just took
             you two seconds to mess it up and start complaining.
    **Frasier:** Well I'm not complaining, Dad, but look at these streaks
             here.  It's like she never waxed a floor before.
     **Martin:** All you do is nag, nag, nag!  Meanwhile she tried a new
             fabric softener on your sweater and you didn't even notice!
    **Frasier:** Well, my sweaters are supposed to be dry-cleaned.
     **Martin:** Oh.
    **Frasier:** Oh, and remind me to say something to her about flipping my
             mattress.
     **Martin:** What the hell are you trying to do, kill her?
    **Frasier:** Easy, easy.  Dad, there's no reason to get all riled up.  
             My God, you're actually perspiring.
     **Martin:** Well I just think some people around here don't realize how
             hard she works.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll say this much: the place does smell lemony fresh.
    _He walks off to his room._
     **Martin:** That shows what you know.  It's country breeze.
    _He grabs at some papers on the coffee table.

    Scene Three - Niles' Apartment
    Fade in.  
    Daphne is straightening up in the living room.  Niles comes down the 
    stairs._
      **Niles:** Daphne, I have to go out for a while.
     **Daphne:** All right.
      **Niles:** No place out of the ordinary, just... out.
    _He comes up behind her to give her a hug or a kiss._
     **Daphne:** Okay.  See you later.
    _She walks away to the other side of the room without looking at him.
    He gets his jacket.  As he puts it on he begins thinking._
      **Niles:**[_voice over of thoughts_] I can't believe this is happening.
             After all those misspent years of frustration and yearning, 
             I finally find the fulfillment of my dreams only to have it
             snatched away.  Look at her.  She's so beautiful, so perfect.
             She deserves nothing but happiness.  I hope, when I'm gone,
             she's able to make a life with someone else.  After a suitable
             period of mourning, of course.
    _He collects his things and reaches for the door._
     **Daphne:** Niles?
      **Niles:**[_emotionally_] Yes, my love?
     **Daphne:**[_firmly_] WHEN are you going to change the paper in the bottom
             of the bird cage, hmm?  I've asked you three times already.
      **Niles:** Soon as I get back.
    _She heads off._
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] Maybe when I'm gone, Her Majesty can muck out her own
             birdcage.
    _He leaves.

    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  
    Martin is in the kitchen, polishing the silverware and talking on the 
    phone._
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, sorry to bother ya.  Trish was wondering where you 
             keep the silver polish.  Right, I told her about that tarnish 
             on your shrimp fork.
    _Reset to: the living room as he comes in._
     **Martin:** She suggested a place you could keep it where the air won't
             get to it.
    _Frasier comes in the front, on his cell phone._
    **Frasier:** Really.  Perhaps she and I could have a discussion about that.
     **Martin:** What are you doin' here?
    **Frasier:** Well, my lunch cancelled, I thought I might drop by, see if
             you might like to join me for a bite.
     **Martin:** Oh, sure, love to.  Let me get my coat.
    **Frasier:** Right, I'll just tell Trish that we're leaving.  Where is she?
     **Martin:** Oh, uh, she's in the powder room.  Let's go.
    **Frasier:** Actually, Dad, I'd rather wait.  You see, I wanted to discuss
             a new vacuuming pattern with her.
     **Martin:** Well, actually, Fras, this might not be a good time.  
             That shrimp fork thing really set her off. She kinda 
             went to pieces and locked herself in there.
    **Frasier:** She did?  I had no idea she was so fragile.
     **Martin:** Well, she'll get over it.  She just needs to be alone for a
             while, she'll be fine. [_calling_] Bye, Trish!
    **Frasier:** No, no, Dad.  You know, if I've hurt her feelings, then it
             is incumbent upon me to apologize.
    _He crosses to the powder room._
     **Martin:** Well...
    _Frasier knocks on the powder room door._
    **Frasier:** Trish, it's Dr. Crane.  Could you come out here, please?  
             I'd like to have a word with you.
    _Hearing nothing, he looks and Martin and spreads his hands._
     **Martin:** The old silent treatment.  Well, two can play that game.
             Let's go.
    **Frasier:** No, no, Dad, why don't you talk to her?
     **Martin:** Oh, I don't think so.
    **Frasier:** Please, Dad, she likes you.  Please.
     **Martin:** Uh, Trish?  Hi, it's Marty.  Listen, I know you're upset, 
             but I'd like to talk to you.  Um, would you unlock the door?
    _He opens the door a very small amount and slips in, blocking Frasier's
    view._
     **Martin:** Thatta girl.
    _He closes the door behind him.  Frasier looks put off.  Martin comes
    back out a moment later._
     **Martin:** All right, you just take all the time you need.
    _He closes the door behind him._
     **Martin:** She accepted your apology but she just wants to be alone
             for a little while, so let's go.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I really should apologize to her in person.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't think this is the time.
    **Frasier:** Why not?
     **Martin:** Well, you have been pretty critical.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I also think that she's made some real
             improvements around here.  Tell her that.
    _Martin, a little exasperated, goes back into the powder room.  After
    a moment, he sticks his face back out the door._
     **Martin:** She wants an example.
    **Frasier:** How should I know?  Make something up.
     **Martin:** Oh, no wonder she's mad, you ungrateful sonofabitch!
    _He closes the door on Frasier's stunned look.  A moment later, Trish
    comes in the front door.  Frasier, looking perturbed, motions her to 
    be silent.  Martin comes out as Frasier rocks on his heels smugly._
     **Martin:** All right, see you later.  Well, now I think you made things
             worse.  It wouldn't surprise me if she didn't come in
             tomorrow.
    _Noticing where Frasier is looking, he glances back.  Looking guilty
    and without anything to say, he slowly sticks his head back into the
    powder room._
     **Martin:** You didn't tell me you had a sister.
    **Frasier:** Dad!  All right, what the hell is going on?
      **Trish:** No idea.  I just came by for my paycheck.
     **Martin:** Well, uh, I got some bad news about that, Trish.  I'm sorry,
             but we're gonna have to let you go.
      **Trish:** Oh.  Okay, but you still owe me for the days I was supposed
             to be here last week.
    _He ushers her out._
     **Martin:** Sure, sure.  And there'll be a check in the mail sometime
             after the first.
    _He closes the door behind her._
     **Martin:**...asteroid hits Earth!

    Niles is waiting in a chair.  The doctor comes in and stands behind his

      **Niles:** Okay, lay it on me.  I'm prepared for the worst.  Is it my
             heart?
     **Doctor:** I'm afraid so.
      **Niles:** Ah-ha!
    _It sinks in a moment._
      **Niles:** What?
     **Doctor:** There is an anomaly in your EKG.  I'm gonna have to check you
             into the hospital.
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, well, hmm.  Uh, I guess I can clear my schedule.
             How's, how's tomorrow afternoon?

    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles is still in the doctor's office.  The doctor comes around and
    sits on the edge of the desk, going over the upcoming hospitalization
    with Niles, who nods his understanding.  Niles begins to cough, and is
    unable to clear his throat.  The doctor steps back and gets a bottle
    of water, holding it out to him.  Seeing the fanny-pack contest label,
    Niles reels in shock, clutching his chest and checking his pulse.
