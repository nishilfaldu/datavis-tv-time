    [_N.B. This episode originally had a subplot about Daphne trying to expand 
    her physical therapy clientele, featuring actress Ana Gasteyer as a physical 
    therapist observing the techniques Daphne used with Martin.  Director David 
    Lee later said the subplot hadn't turned out as well as hoped, so the subplot
    was scrapped.  Gasteyer returned to play housekeeper Trish Haney in[
    [10.07] "Bristle While You Work"](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_7/bristle_while_you_work_1.html), which was filmed after this episode._]
    
    [_Act 1
    
    Scene 1 -Frasier's Apartment
    Martin is lying prone on a gurney.  Daphne massages his hip._]
    
     **Martin:**  Ow! All right, all right, I'll talk!  Just make the pain stop.
     **Daphne:**  Oh, shut up.  I'm just trying to get the blood flowing.
     **Martin:**  Oh, more like make me hemorrhage.
     **Daphne:**  Don't tempt me.
     **Martin:**  Oh, God, you broke something!
     **Daphne:**  Too bad it wasn't your bloody pie hole!  There, we're done,
              you big baby.
     **Martin:**  [_genuinely disappointed_] What, already? [_rising_] Oh, that felt
              great! Oh!  I feel like a new man.  I love your new table.
     **Daphne:**  Oh, you're sweet.  Can I make you a sandwich?
     **Martin:**  Oh, that'd be great.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Daph, you know,
              they're showing the first-ever episode of _Rockford_ today.
              If you're really serious about becoming an American citizen,
              maybe you ought to watch it.
    
    [_Martin sits in his chair.  Frasier and Niles enter.  Frasier is holding
    an envelope._]
    
      **Niles:**  Well, now you've opened it.  That's mail theft.
    **Frasier:**  Nonsense.
     **Martin:**  What's going on?
    **Frasier:**  Nothing.  Just another piece of Cam Winston's mail has found
              its way into our box.  It's been happening a lot since we
              switched mailboxes.  Even after I gave the postman a stern
              lecture.
     **Martin:**  Especially after.
    **Frasier:**  Anyway, it was an honest mistake.  Cam and I are on all the
              same mailing lists, and I'm sure mine is in his box.  Besides,
              it's nothing personal, look, it's just an announcement for
              some place called _La Porte d'Argent._
     **Martin:**  Probably just another froufrou restaurant or froufrou clothing
              store.
    **Frasier:**  No, no, no, this is not "froufrou," Dad, as evidenced by the
              manly scent of balsam.
      **Niles:**  [_taking the letter and sniffing_] Hmm.
    **Frasier:**  They obviously deal with a very upscale clientele.
      **Niles:**  Hmm.  Oh!  _La Porte d'Argent!_  Someone at the racquet club
              was talking about this.  It's very, very exclusive.
    **Frasier:**  [_excitedly_] Yes?
      **Niles:**  That's all I know.  Some ill-mannered person started up his
              blow dryer before I could hear any more.
     **Daphne:**  [_entering from the kitchen with Martin's sandwich_] Hello!
      **Niles:**  Oh, Daphne, Daphne!  Did I get one of these [_holding up the
              announcement_] in the mail today?
     **Daphne:**  No, I don't think so.
    **Frasier:**  [_grabbing the announcement_] Poor Niles.
     **Daphne:**  What's this about?
     **Martin:**  Oh, they're all worked up about some smelly invitation Frasier
              stole to some place they never heard of.
     **Daphne:**  [_unsurprised_] Oh.
    **Frasier:**  Yes, but that's what's so intriguing, Dad, that there exists
              an exclusive place in Seattle that neither of us knows about.
    
    [_Niles picks up the phone and starts dialing._]
    
     **Niles:**  [_rising_] It could be an art gallery, or a new haberdashery.
    **Martin:**  Or an Italian shoelace boutique.
    
    [_Daphne laughs at this._]
    
      **Niles:**  What's happening?
    **Frasier:**  It's a machine.  It's asking me to enter my six-digit
              access code.  What'll I do?
     **Martin:**  Why don't you just punch in whatever keys spell out "SNOBBY"?
    
    [_Frasier glares at him._]
    
    **Niles:**  You know, it might be worth a try.
    
    [_Frasier punches it in, listens, then grimaces._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Oh, denied!
      **Niles:**  Oh!  The allure of the _Porte D'Argent_ has increased tenfold!
    **Frasier:**  All right, here's our plan.  We go to the university computer
              lab, bribe some hungry hacker, and, once we've tapped into
              their mainframe, _La Porte D'Argent_ will give up her sweet secret
              like a blushing bride on her wedding night!
     **Martin:**  Why don't you just go down there and ask them what they do?
    
    [_Frasier and Niles look taken aback._]
    
    **Frasier:**  All right, Dad, that's a "Plan B".
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    **PLAN B**
    
    _Scene 2 - La Porte D'Argente_
    
    [_Fade in.  Frasier comes into the reception area, admires the stylish
    decor and then goes to the front desk._]
    
         **Frasier:**  Hello.  Uh, is this La Porte D'Argent?
    **Receptionist:**  Yes, it is.
         **Frasier:**  Ah, good.  Say, someone was asking me earlier today
                   about La Porte D'Argent, and I had a difficult time
                   characterizing it.  What would you tell him?
    **Receptionist:**  We try to discourage word of mouth.
         **Frasier:**  That's exactly what I said.  So, well, I'm here to take
                   advantage of your offer.
    
    [_He hands the invitation over._]
    
    **Receptionist:**  Sure.  Can I have your name, please?
         **Frasier:**  Yes.  Frasier Crane.
    **Receptionist:**  [_typing it into the computer_]  I'm not finding you.
         **Frasier:**  Try Doctor Frasier Crane.  Perhaps you've heard my
                   popular radio show.
    **Receptionist:**  I'm not really a radio person.  I'm sorry Dr. Crane,
                   you're not on the list, I can't let you in.
         **Frasier:**  But I have an invitation.
    **Receptionist:**  Yes, but you're not on the list.
         **Frasier:**  Yes, but I do have an invitation!
    **Receptionist:**  But you aren't on the LIST.
         **Frasier:**  Yes, well, if I was on the list, I wouldn't need an
                   invitation, I'd just say "I'm on the list."  Therefore,
                   the invitation supercedes the list.
    **Receptionist:**  No, invitations are given out only to those on the list.
         **Frasier:**  Ah-ha.  But you do concede that I do have a valid
                   invitation?
    **Receptionist:**  Yes.
         **Frasier:**  Then it naturally follows that I would be on the list.
    **Receptionist:**  But you're not.
         **Frasier:**  Then how did I GET the invitation?
    **Receptionist:**  I really don't know.  You could have stolen it...
    
    [_He returns to his work.  Niles comes into the reception area._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Are you accusing me of deception?
    
    [_He notices Niles._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Cam!  Cam Winston!  There you are.
    
    [_He gestures Niles over._]
    
      **Niles:**  [_in a deep voice_]  Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**  You know, while I was waiting for you, I decided to test the
              mettle of this young man.  I'm pleased to report that he
              follows the rules of La Porte D'Argent to the letter.
    
    [_He and Niles laugh heartily._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Anyway, I am a guest of Mr. Cam Winston's here.  He told me
              to meet him here, gave me the invitation and here I am.
      **Niles:**  Yes, I'm Cam Winston and he's my guest and I asked him to
              meet me here.
    
    [_The receptionist checks his records, then hands folders across to
    them._]
    
    **Receptionist:**  Here you are, Mr. Winston.  Welcome to La Porte D'Argent.
         **Frasier:**  Ah, thank you.
    **Receptionist:**  I hope you both enjoy your stay.  Take a moment to look
                   over our services and I'll be back in just a moment.
    
    [_He heads through a silver door and the boys look over the folders._]
    
    **Frasier:**  [_excited_]  Niles, it's a day spa!
      **Niles:**  [_still in a deep voice_]  Good gravy, this is fantastic!
    **Frasier:**  Would you stop talking like that?  That's the worst
              impersonation of Cam Winston I've ever heard.
      **Niles:**  You've heard another one?
    **Frasier:**  Of course not.
      **Niles:**  Then it's the best!
    
    [_They take seats._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Now you're stuck talking like that all day.
    
    [_The receptionist comes back out.  Niles and Frasier rise and he holds
    out cards to them._]
    
    **Receptionist:**  Here are your keys, gentlemen.  Your estheticians will
                   be with you shortly.
         **Frasier:**  Thank you.
           **Niles:**  [_booming_]  Thank you.
    
    [_He clears his throat and talks normally._]
    
    **Niles:**  Thank you.  Oh, I've been waiting for that all morning.
    
    [_Frasier gives him a dry look as the receptionist leaves again.  They
    return to their seats and look over their choices._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Oh, Niles, the arovetic massage sounds splendid: two
              therapists at once, using hot stones and a blend of essential
              oils personally created for your dosha.
      **Niles:**  I think I'll have the aromatherapy Swedish.
    **Frasier:**  Oh, Niles, look at this bounty!  Take a risk, be a man!
      **Niles:**  [_looking at the folder again_]  The chardonnay/rose hip salt
              glow?
    **Frasier:**  Now that's more like it.
    
    [_An attendant comes out and hands them bundles with robes and sandals._]
    
        **Niles:**  Hello.
      **Frasier:**  Lovely.
    **Attendant:**  Right this way.
    
    [_She leads them off._]
    
      **Niles:**  Frasier, Frasier!  River rocks and a stalk of wheat!
    **Frasier:**  Ooh.
    
    [_They follow the young lady through the door.  Fade out._]
    
    **AFTER THE RUBBIN'**
    
    _Scene 3 - La Porte D'Argent_
    
    [_Fade in.  Frasier and Niles are putting their jackets back on after
    their therapies._]
    
      **Niles:**  I knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea it would
              be this good!  I feel like I've been rubbed by angels.
    **Frasier:**  Niles, I just wish you had tried the vusattasen
              aqua-treatment.  I feel as if I'd had a rebirthing experience.
              I've never felt better in my life.
      **Niles:**  I'm so polished my entire body is squeaking.
    
    [_He shifts.  They step up to check out._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Hello.
      Clerk:  How was everything?
      **Niles:**  Heaven.
    **Frasier:**  Nirvana.
      Clerk:  I'm so glad.  Now, this is a breakdown of your services.
    
    [_She hands them bills and they choke slightly upon reading them._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Nirvana ain't cheap.  Well, it's worth it, I suppose.  What
              do you say we make this a standing appointment, Niles?
      **Niles:**  Well, I think we owe it to ourselves.
    **Frasier:**  Yes.
      Clerk:  I'd be happy to set that up.  Now, I've also put together a
              personal La Porte D'Argent product system for each of you, based
              on the recommendations of your estheticians.
    
    [_She hands them bags and they gasp in delight at the contents.  Frasier
    tries a mist spray._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Oh, Niles, this smells great.  Try that.
      Clerk:  Ah, the mid-afternoon anti-stress spritz.
      **Niles:**  [_studying something_]  I've never even heard of eyelash
              conditioner.
    **Frasier:**  Ah, hence the brittle lashes.
    
    [_Niles brushes some on, then notices a man going through a gold door._]
    
      **Niles:**  Say, isn't that Senator Ogden?
    **Frasier:**  It is!  Oh, Niles, this just gets better and better.
              Balanced skin and social advancement all in one setting.
              I'm going to go say hello.
    
    [_He heads over, but the Senator has already gone through.  Frasier
    presses on the door._]
    
      Clerk:  I'm sorry.  That area is restricted to our gold level
              members.
      **Niles:**  You have a gold level?  How do you get in?
      Clerk:  You'd have to be on the list.
    **Frasier:**  Well, we ARE on the list.
      Clerk:  The GOLD list.
    **Frasier:**  This is absurd!  I am a member of every exclusive club in
              this entire town.  You must have a reciprocal membership
              with one of them.
      Clerk:  I'm sorry.  But you're more than welcome to enjoy the many
              amenities of the silver level.
    **Frasier:**  And just how are we supposed to enjoy this!?
    
    [_He angrily sprays the anti-stress spritz in his face._]
    
    **Frasier:**  And this isn't working!
    
    [_He stands there fuming as Niles applies more eyelash conditioner.
    Fade out._]
    
    _End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    [_Fade in.  Martin is in his chair and Daphne is on the couch, watching
    TV._]
    
    **Daphne:**  You never told me Rockford was Maverick.
    **Martin:**  Well, technically he isn't Maverick in this, he's Rockford.
             Even though we all know he's secretly Maverick.
    **Daphne:**  I can see why you like this show.
    **Martin:**  Yeah, what's not to like?  Solving crimes, pretty girls, car
             chases...
    **Daphne:**  Leisure suits.
    **Martin:**  Yeah.
    **Daphne:**  Rockford's dad reminds me of you.
    **Martin:**  [_brow furrowing_]  What are you talkin' about?
    **Daphne:**  Rockford's dad.  You're just like him: cranky but loveable.
    **Martin:**  The hell I am!  I'm like Rockford.
    **Daphne:**  How'd you get that?
    **Martin:**  Well, come on: he solves crimes, I solved crimes.  We're both
             in tune with the beat of the street.  He's the kind of guy that
             men want to be and women want to be with.  When this show
             first came out, everybody used to say I was like Rockford.
    **Daphne:**  I'm sorry, I don't see it.  You still remind me of his dad.
    **Martin:**  Rocky?  But he's old.  [_realizing the implication_]  Oh, I see.
    **Daphne:**  I didn't mean that.  I just meant there's something about him
             that reminds me of you.
    **Martin:**  His oldness?
    **Daphne:**  Oh, stop it!  If you want to be Rockford, you can be Rockford,
             I don't care.
    **Martin:**  Fine, then let's just watch it.
    
    [_They watch for a few moment, Martin quietly stewing.  Then he grabs
    the remote and turns off the TV._]
    
    **Martin:**  I don't want to watch this anymore.  Congratulations, you
             ruined Rockford for me.
    
    [_Frasier and Niles come in the front door._]
    
      **Niles:**  I had a nagging feeling the whole time they were holding
              something back on purpose.
    **Frasier:**  "Blended for your dosha," indeed!  They wouldn't know my dosha
              if they fell over it!
     **Daphne:**  So what kind of hoity toity place did it end up being?
    
    [_Frasier paces around as Niles goes to get sherry._]
    
    **Frasier:**  It was a hell-hole!  They had the nerve to call it a day spa,
              when it's nothing more than a mere front for a bona fide
              luxury spa which taunts those kept at bay outside its golden
              door!
     **Martin:**  If you didn't go in, how do you know it's better?
    **Frasier:**  It had to be!  The door was gold, ours was only silver.  Gold
              is better than silver.
    
    [_He sits down as Niles brings sherries over._]
    
    **Niles:**  [_muttering_] Stupid silver.
    
    [_He hands Frasier his sherry as Daphne rises and gives him a hug._]
    
    **Daphne:**  Well, you'll always be in my exclusive club, honey.
     **Niles:**  Oh, thanks.  And that's all I need.
    
    [_He sits next to Frasier._]
    
      **Niles:**  There must be somebody who can get us in.
    **Frasier:**  Let's go comb our Rolodexes!
    
    [_They both rise._]
    
    **Niles:**  Yes, there has to be a way out of the slum they call the silver
            room.
    
    [_Frasier heads to his room as Niles goes out the front._]
    
    **Niles:**  Why do I keep squeaking!?
    
    [_He closes the door behind him.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 2 - Cafe Nervosa_
    
    [_Fade in.  Frasier is sitting at a table.  Roz comes in._]
    
    **Roz:**  Hey, Frasier.  Wait 'til you see this.  It is so cool.
    
    [_She sits down._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Really?  Well, I could use something to balm my wounds.
              Painful as it is, I've come to accept that I shall never pass
              through that spa's gold door.
        **Roz:**  Anyway, I was filing your new head shot...
    **Frasier:**  Yes?
        **Roz:**  And I started looking at your old ones, I went back to when
              you first started?
    
    [_She holds up a stack of photos and quickly flips through them,
    laughing.  Frasier gets a sour look on his face as she does it again._]
    
        **Roz:**  Woo.
    **Frasier:**  What am I looking at?
        **Roz:**  Oh, it's like an animation of your hairline receding.  Isn't
              that great?  Okay, wait now, here's the good part: [_she
              flips them the other way_] it's growing back!  Receding...
              growing back.
    
    **Frasier:**  Yes, yes, all right Roz, that's enough!  All right!
    
    [_He grabs at the photos to stop her.  Niles comes in._]
    
        **Roz:**  Oh, don't be so sensitive.
      **Niles:**  Hi.
        **Roz:**  Hi.
    **Frasier:**  Oh, Niles, no good news, I suppose.
      **Niles:**  I've had no luck getting us into the gold level.
        **Roz:**  Are you guys really this bent out of shape over that gold
              spa?
    **Frasier:**  Yes!
        **Roz:**  Why can't you be happy with the silver one?
      **Niles:**  Gold is better.
        **Roz:**  Bull!  The only reason why you want to go there is because
              you can't!
    **Frasier:**  We saw a senator go in there.  A senator!  We elected him,
              he works for us!  How is it fair that our employee is
              admitted while we are shunted off to the icy depths of silver
              level?!
        **Roz:**  It's a spa!  How much better could it be?  I mean, are they
              gonna carry you around like a sultan?  You gonna be massaged
              by supermodels?  And what if you do get through the gold
              door?  What next, the diamond door?  And after that a
              titanium door!  And after that a plutonium door!
      **Niles:**  Oh, that's ridiculous.  Plutonium's radioactive, no one's
              going to make a door out of it.
    **Frasier:**  Although Roz does make a point, Niles.  What kind of fantasy
              are we chasing?
    
    [_He sighs._]
    
        **Roz:**  See?  I'm right.
    **Frasier:**  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm just imagining supermodels with that
              crook Senator Ogden.
        **Roz:**  It was Senator Ogden? [_laughing_] I know him.
      **Niles:**  You do?
        **Roz:**  Yeah, he really owes me one, too.  Want me to give him a
              call?
    **Frasier:**  Would you?  Absolutely!
      **Niles:**  How do you know Senator Ogden?
        **Roz:**  Well, I knew him a few years ago when his marriage was on the
              rocks.  We kept it very hush-hush.  Thank God I knew CPR.
    
    [_The brothers sit, digesting this.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    [_Fade in.  Daphne is on the couch, thumbing through TV Guide.  Martin
    is in his chair._]
    
    **Daphne:**  Rockford's on.
    **Martin:**  Not interested.
    **Daphne:**  Oh, come on, it looks like a good one.  Tom Seleck's in it.
    **Martin:**  Oh, those are good.  Not that I care.
    **Daphne:**  You know, I caught a few episodes at home, and I see the
             resemblance between you and a young Jim Rockford.
    **Martin:**  No you don't.
    **Daphne:**  Yes I do.  No one gives him credit when he has a good idea.
             He likes to drive a little too fast...
    **Martin:**  He has my chin!  He knows how to work the system and the babes
             love him.
    **Daphne:**  Yes they do.  So what do you say?
    **Martin:**  Oh, okay, why not?
    
    [_He turns on the TV._]
    
    **Martin:**  Ah, this is good.  Sorry I got so worked up.
    **Daphne:**  Oh, you can't help it.  You've got principles, like Rockford.
    **Martin:**  Okay, let's not lay it on too thick.  Oh, and look at that.
             Malibu, California.  FYI, those mountains you see in the
             background are the same ones you see at the beginning of MASH.
    **Daphne:**  Oh, I love MASH.  Whenever I watch it, I think of you.
             Serving in Korea all those years ago, just like Colonel Potter.
    
    [_Martin lets this sink in, then grabs the remote and shuts off the TV._]
    
    **Martin:**  That's it, go home.
    **Daphne:**  Why?
    **Martin:**  Colonel Potter was old when he did Dragnet!
    **Daphne:**  Colonel Potter, that funny young doctor that used to mix
             martinis in his tent?
    **Martin:**  Oh, you're thinking of Hawkeye.
    **Daphne:**  Yes, that's who I meant.
    
    [_Martin gives her a calculating look, while she looks back innocently.
    He reaches for the remote again._]
    
    **Martin:**  Okay.
    
    [_He turns the TV back on and settles down happily.  Daphne sits back
    with a wide-eyed, sarcastic look at his willingness to go along._]
    
    **DOOR JAM**
    
    _Scene 4 - La Porte D'Argent_
    
    [_Fade in.  It is a plant-filled room with the sounds of running water
    and birds.  A woman wheels Niles in on a gurney.  He is wrapped up like
    a mummy and has a facial and cucumber slices on his eyes._]
    
    **Attendant:**  I've taken you to the relaxation grotto.  We'll just let
                the wrap and your orange honey-butter mask soothe you while
                you listen to the healing sounds of the Javanese rain
                forest, okay?
    
    **Niles:**  [_murmuring sleepily_] Okay.
    
    [_She leaves him and passes Frasier as he comes in.  Blinking and
    shuffling in his robe, he runs into a potted tree._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Oh, excuse me.
      **Niles:**  Frasier?  Frasier, is that you?
    **Frasier:**  Niles.
      **Niles:**  What?
    **Frasier:**  I just had a, a color therapy treatment, my eyes haven't
              readjusted yet.  They sent me in here to relax.
      **Niles:**  I'm letting my orange honey-butter mask set.
    
    [_They both sigh contentedly.  Frasier sits down._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Roz was so wrong.  Completely wrong.  Oh, there.  My eyes are
              better.  Oh, Niles, you should see this place.
      **Niles:**  Be my eyes, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**  [_rising_]  Well, it's just paradise.  From the rare exotic
              orchids, to the trompe l'oeil sky, to the perfectly bubbled
              stream, to the...
    
    [_He stands there, stunned at what he sees._]
    
      **Niles:**  To the what?
    **Frasier:**  There's a platinum door.
      **Niles:**  Platinum?  Are you sure?
    **Frasier:**  Yes!
      **Niles:**  Is it guarded?
    **Frasier:**  No!  It's just brazenly standing there!
      **Niles:**  Then rip the cucumbers from my eyes and let's go!
    **Frasier:**  Right!
    
    [_He takes the slices off Niles' eyes and helps him sit up._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Niles!  What are we doing?
    
    [_He lets Niles fall back onto the gurney._]
    
      **Niles:**  Oh.
    **Frasier:**  This is exactly what Roz said!
      **Niles:**  No!  Roz said, "diamond door"!
    
    [_He throws his legs over the side and manages to sit up, only to fall
    down the other way._]
    
    [_N.B. During the filming of this scene, David Hyde Pierce fell off the 
    gurney and hit his head on the floor.  He had to be rushed to the 
    hospital, but no major injuries were reported._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Niles, this is heaven, right here and now!  Why do we have
              think about someplace else?
      **Niles:**  This is only heaven to the people that can't get into the
              real heaven.  The platinum heaven.
    **Frasier:**  Niles, why can't we be happy?  Why must we allow the thought
              of something that at this point can only be incrementally
              better ruin what is here and now?
      **Niles:**  I don't know.  Let's figure it out on the other side!
    
    [_He heaves himself upright again, only to fall to the other side once
    more._]
    
    **Frasier:**  No!  I am through chasing the eternal carrot.  Whatever is
              behind that door shall remain behind that door, unseen!
    
    [_Niles thrashes again, finally managing to get up off the gurney._]
    
    **Niles:**  Stay if you want, I have to know!
    
    [_He starts towards the door, but since he is wrapped down to the
    ankles, he can only take four inch steps.  Nonetheless, he shuffles
    rapidly and heads for the door._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Oh for God's sake, you can't even walk, you ninny!  All
              right, all right, I will go, just to take a peek.
    
    [_He heads for the door as an attendant comes into the grotto behind
    them to change the water pitcher._]
    
    **Attendant:**  I'm sorry.  Sir?  You're not allowed through there.  Please
                remain in the relaxation grotto.
    
    [_He heads out.  Frasier stands there, outraged._]
    
    **Frasier:**  "Please remain... in the relaxation grotto"?
    
    [_Niles is heartbroken and almost sobbing._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Have crueler words ever been spoken?  Well, that's it.  I am
              determined to see where they think I don't belong!
      **Niles:**  Take me with you!
    
    [_Frasier strides over, wraps his arms around Niles, lifts him up and
    carries him to the door.  He then kicks it open with his foot and
    sunlight streams into the room.  They gasp in delight._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Niles!  Healing warmth and light!  It must be a magnificent
              solarium!
      **Niles:**  Goodbye sweet and edible facials, hello radiant life-giving
              sun!
    
    [_Frasier carries him through the door.  Cut to - the other side of the
    door as the come through it, blinking in the light, letting the door
    close behind them._]
    
      **Niles:**  It's beautiful, it's beautiful!
    **Frasier:**  Yes!  This is where we belong.
    
    [_The shot pulls back to show that, rather than a solarium, they are in
    an alley behind the building, next to a trash dumpster._]
    
      **Niles:**  Do you smell garbage?
    **Frasier:**  Oh dear, Niles.  I don't think this is part of the spa!
    
    [_Leaving Niles propped against the dumpster he pounds on the door._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Hello!  Hello!  Anyone in the relaxation grotto!
      **Niles:**  Frasier, look at all those bees.
    **Frasier:**  Bees?!  Niles!  Our sweet and edible facials!  Run!
    
    [_He takes off down the alley.  Niles, still wrapped can only
    desperately shuffle after him.  Fade out._]
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Roz is at Cafe Nervosa with Senator Ogden.  She shows him the flip book
    of photos with Frasier's receding hair line.  They both laugh.  After
    a moment, though, the senator clutches his chest and falls to the
    floor.  Everyone rushes over while Roz, a frustrated look on her face,
    gets down to give him CPR again.
