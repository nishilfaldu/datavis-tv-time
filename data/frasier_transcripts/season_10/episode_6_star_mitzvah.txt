## Hey, Freddie!

    
    
    Frederick has appeared in the following episodes:
    [3.09] Frasier Grinch
    [4.07] A Lilith Thanksgiving
    [4.16] The Unnatural
    [6.11] Good Samaritan
    [7.09] The Apparent Trap
    [8.10] Cranes Unplugged
    [9.18] War of the Words
    
    N.B. This episode first aired on election night.  In addition to this,
    a 90-minute "Fear Factor" was scheduled this evening, which caused the
    episode to air 1/2 hour late even in the Eastern time zone.  In other 
    time zones, the airing of the episode was disrupted by election 
    coverage and occurred at unusual times.  In some markets it was not 
    shown at all.  You may therefore want to keep your eyes open for when 
    it will be rerun if you missed it, as it is an excellent and funny 
    episode with a memorable return for Lilith and Freddie, who have not 
    appeared together since "The Apparent Trap" in Season Seven.

    **Skyline:** A blimp flies over the city.
    
    _ACT ONE_
    
    _Scene One - Lilith's Home
    Freddie is seated at the table, writing.  Lilith stands near a 
    bookcase, going through a file drawer._
    
     **Lilith:** Here we are.  File A, slide sheet 1, image 1 of subject 
             Frederick G. Crane.
    **Freddie:** Mom!
     **Lilith:**[_showing him the slide sheet_] Here you are, just an hour after
             being wrestled from my grudging womb.
    **Freddie:** Gross!
     **Lilith:** You know, if you'd like there's still time to include this in
             your Bar Mitzvah video.
    **Freddie:** Thanks, but I just want to get through this thing with as 
             little humiliation as possible.
     **Lilith:**[_going through a box_] Oh, look at this!  Your hospital cap.  
             The very combed cotton that swaddled your little...[_voice 
             breaking_] head. 
    _Lilith's emotional reaction is very minor, but somehow, for her it 
    seems big._
    **Freddie:** Are you okay?
     **Lilith:** Of course I am.  It's only natural that there should be some
             emotional upheaval caused by the impending shift in our
             relationship.  I knew it would come, I just wasn't expecting
             such a roller coaster. [_She pauses briefly._] All done.  Is 
             this your guest list?  Oh, I didn't realize you wanted to 
             invite so many friends.  I don't even know some of these 
             people.  And why are you inviting Jeremy Berman?  I thought 
             you told me he's the biggest nerd in your class.
    **Freddie:** He's not so bad.  Besides, the more people you invite, the 
             more presents you get.
     **Lilith:** Frederick... a Bar Mitzvah is a rite of passage, not an
             opportunity for you to collect presents.
    **Freddie:** I'm sorry.  You're right.  I'll try to trim it down.
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene Two -- KACL
    Frasier is walking down the hall.  Kenny approaches.
    _
      **Kenny:** Hey, Doc!
    **Frasier:** Kenny.
      **Kenny:** I can't tell you how touched I am that Freddie invited me to
             his Bar Mitzvah.
    **Frasier:** He did?
      **Kenny:** Yeah!  What a great kid!  That's your son, right?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I wasn't aware that you two had met.
      **Kenny:** We haven't.  Eh, I guess he's probably heard his share of 
             Kenny stories.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckling_] Yeah.  From whom?
      **Kenny:** You sly kidder.  It sounds like a hoot, but if I don't find
             someone to drive with me to Boston and share a tent on the
             way, I probably won't be able to afford to go.
    **Frasier:** Hmm.
      **Kenny:** Fun drive, I bet.
    **Frasier:**[_nodding_] Hmm.
      **Kenny:** I guess I can just send him something.
    **Frasier:** I think he'd like that.  Thanks, Kenny.
    _Frasier taps him on the shoulder and goes to enter the studio.
    Another employee, Jason (who just happens to have appeared in a much
    larger role in episode[[9.05]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_5/love_stinks.html "Love Stinks") "Love Stinks"), approaches.
    _
      **Jason:**[_holding an invitation envelope_] Hey, Dr. Crane!  Mazel Tov!
    _Frasier nods and enters the booth.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Three - KACL
    Roz comes into the studio from her booth._
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:** Freddie's so sweet.  He sent me an invitation to his Bar 
             Mitzvah. [_She produces the invitation._]
    **Frasier:** Yes, apparently the people of Washington state have made quite
             an impression on him.
        **Roz:** Can you believe Freddie is thirteen years old already?
    
    [_N.B. This is now Frederick's correct age.  Freddie was born in 
    November 1989, but in "Good Samaritan" he had suddenly aged a couple 
    of years.  In "Cranes Unplugged," Freddie is said to be thirteen.  
    Now it seems the writers have realized their mistake and returned 
    Freddie to the right age._]
    
    **Frasier:** I can hardly think about it without choking up.  This is my
             son, Roz.  The little bald candy man that used to fit right
             here in the crook of my arm.
        **Roz:**[_sweetly, teasing_] "Little bald candy man."  That's adorable.
             I had a boyfriend who called hi...
    _She stops herself, quite embarrassed.  Frasier stares with a grin._
        **Roz:**[_recovers_] Is it weird to have a son brought up in a different 
             religion from yours?
    **Frasier:** Not at all, Roz.  It's a faith that espouses love, compassion,
             duty, education, and art.  All values which I cherish.  And
             though I have played a relatively small role in his spiritual
             development, he has honored me by asking that I say a few 
             words.  And in the spirit of the occasion, I'm going to try to 
             learn it in Hebrew.
    _Noel enters, wearing a backpack._
       **Noel:** Hi, Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Hi, Noel.
       **Noel:** Hi, Roz.  You've never worn that sweater on a Tuesday before.
        **Roz:** I've asked you to take your hands out of your pockets when you
             talk to me. 
    _Noel obeys.  She exits._
       **Noel:** So, I don't think I can make the Bar Mitzvah.
    **Frasier:** Great. [_recovering_] I mean that sarcastically, of course, 
             Noel. [_feigning disappointment_] Great!  You're not coming, 
             terrific!
       **Noel:** Yeah, sorry.  Did I overhear you say you want to learn Hebrew?
    **Frasier:** Not learn it, I'm saving that pleasure for retirement.  But I
             have composed a speech and I-I'd like to say it in Hebrew.
       **Noel:** Well, I can translate and teach you how to say it if you want.
    **Frasier:** You can, really, oh, Noel, thank you!
       **Noel:** Of course, I'll expect a little something quid pro quo.
    **Frasier:** Certainly, whatever you'd like.
       **Noel:** Great!  The Seattle _Star Trek_ convention is this weekend, 
             and all the _Enterprise_ captains are making an appearance.
             I need Scott Bakula's autograph to make my collection 
             complete.
    **Frasier:** Noel, isn't this something you could do yourself?
       **Noel:** I would, but William Shatner's restraining order against me
             is still in effect.  It's so stupid.  It wasn't even a real
             phaser.
    
    [_N.B. The first reference to this restraining order is made in[[6.13]](/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_13/the_show_where_woody_shows_up.html "The Show Where Woody Shows Up"), 
    "The Show Where Woody Comes Back."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Noel, don't you have any friends that could do this for you?
       **Noel:** Trust me, there are no friends in the world of _Star Trek_
             autography.
    **Frasier:** I see.  Well, then, consider it done.
       **Noel:** Well, thank you so much! 
    _He opens his backpack and gets a publicity photo of Bakula in his garb 
    as Captain Archer._
    **Frasier:** Now, be sure to keep it in this acid-free covering until the 
             actual signing, and if you must handle it, use these cotton 
             gloves.
    **Frasier:**[_taking them_] Okay.
       **Noel:** You'll be the hit of the Bar Mitzvah, I promise.  And don't be
             surprised if you get caught up in the fun of the convention, 
             too.
    **Frasier:**[_patiently_] Yeah, I'll try to pace myself.
       **Noel:** Thanks again, Dr. Crane. 
    _He begins to leave._
    **Frasier:** Noel!  How did you know I would do it?
       **Noel:** What do you mean?
    **Frasier:** Well, you must have known I would do this for you, or you
             wouldn't be carrying around a picture of Scott Bakula, right?
       **Noel:**[_playing along, but confused_] Right.
    _He exits.  
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's apartment
    Niles is seated on the couch.  Martin enters carrying a massive,
    antiquated dinosaur of a flash camera._
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles, think fast! 
    _He flashes the camera, which produces a bright, blinding light, 
    knocking Niles over._
      **Niles:** Dad!
    _The camera makes a high-pitched electronic sound of recovery in the 
    wake of the giant flash.  Daphne enters from the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** What is that?
     **Martin:** My good old Scheerblad-7X-K.
      **Niles:** The blindingest, noisiest, fifteen-pound camera ever produced 
             in the former Soviet Union!
     **Martin:** Can you believe it?  Somehow it got buried deep down in 
             storage.  But, Eddie and I found it just in time for the 
             Bar Mitzvah.
     **Daphne:** What smells like burning plastic?
     **Martin:** Oh, that means the flash unit's working.
      **Niles:**[_still blinking it off_] I thought the retina-scorching flash 
             meant that the flash unit was working.
     **Martin:** Not always.
      **Niles:** I still remember the night of my junior prom.  Dad wanted to 
             get a nice close-up of me and Margaret Coover.  Unfortunately 
             he got a little too close and the heat from the flash seared 
             the gold plating off Margaret's necklace onto her skin.
     **Daphne:** You never mentioned Margaret Coover before.
      **Niles:** I didn't?  Margaret Coover.  Petite, brunette, gilded.
    _Frasier enters, whereupon he is immediately greeted by the flash and 
    the high squeal.  He is thrown back against the door, blinking and 
    disoriented._
    **Frasier:** Dear God, the old flash-and-whine!
      **Niles:**[_deadpan_] Dad found it.
     **Martin:** Yeah, good thing, too.  Hasn't failed me yet.  Oh, except for
             that one Thanksgiving when the flash washed Lilith out so bad
             all you could see were her hair and eyes.
    **Frasier:** That wasn't the camera's fault, Dad.  That bloodless skin has
             confounded even the most experienced photographer.
     **Martin:** Hey, Daph, do you know where the tripod is?  I might need it 
             for group shots.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I think it's in the back of your closet.  Come on, I'll 
             help you look for it.
    _Martin rises, with the camera around his neck.  As he attempts to 
    stand, the camera's weight pulls him down and he almost falls forward.  
    He walks hunched over after Daphne._
      **Niles:** Sherry, Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Please, Niles.
      **Niles:** I have good news.
    **Frasier:** Hmm?
      **Niles:** I have two tickets to the Udo Fritzenheim show at the museum
             tomorrow, not to mention an invitation for lunch with the 
             artist afterwards.
    **Frasier:**[_excited_] Oh, are you serious, Niles?  Lunch with a Dada 
             master!  Oh, I'd love to come!  But I can't.  I have other 
             plans.  I promised Noel Shempsky I'd do a favor for him and 
             I've got to remain true to my word.  Although perhaps I could 
             go to the show, leave the luncheon early and still fulfill my 
             commitment.
      **Niles:**[_handing him the sherry_] Oh yes, of course you could.
    **Frasier:** Yeah, you're right, Niles.  There. [_They toast._] You know, it
             was at a Fritzenheim show in Boston where Freddie first said
             the word "Dada."  I remember swelling with pride thinking that
             perhaps he was an art history savant, but of course Lilith
             deflated my enthusiasm by pointing out that he was probably
             just referring to me. 
    _He chuckles.  Martin and Daphne re-enter._
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, good news, found the tripod.
    **Frasier:** Oh, splendid. 
    _He looks at a photo of Frederick on display._
     **Martin:** It's tough to watch your kids grow up.
    **Frasier:** Well, he's... still just a boy.  He's only thirteen.
     **Martin:**[_tapping his shoulder_] It goes fast.
     **Daphne:** How's Lilith taking it?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose it's a bittersweet experience for her.  
             I can't really say for sure.  You know, she's always 
             been rather guarded with her emotions.
      **Niles:** Not always, Frasier, I've seen her get quite emotional.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure you have, Mr. Been-There-Done-That.
     **Daphne:** What does that mean?
    _Frasier, Martin, and Niles are all taken aback and look at each other
    uncomfortably.  All together, they say "Nothing."_
     **Daphne:**[_to Niles_] What are you hiding?
      **Niles:** Oh... [_he struggles at length for words_] Um... some years 
             ago... 
    _He looks to Frasier for help._
    **Frasier:** In a complete drunken stupor...
     **Martin:** Totally stinko...
      **Niles:** Yes... I had an unplanned, uh, and instantly regretted, uh, 
             night of amore... with Lilith.
     **Daphne:** A one-nighter?
      **Niles:**[_stupidly_] Of amore.
    _Martin and Frasier look at each other in discomfort._
    [_N.B. This was the major event of "Room Service," listed above._]
    
     **Daphne:** Lilith?!
      **Niles:** Well, it was after Maris, and long before you.  In fact,
             it's pretty funny when you think about it.
    _He laughs nervously.  Frasier and Martin join.  Daphne is not amused._
      **Niles:** And remember, I was drunk.
     **Daphne:** You'd have to be, wouldn't you? [_realizing_] Oh, sorry, 
             Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, drinking definitely took the edge off.
     **Daphne:** And when were you planning on sharing this interesting bit of
             information with me?
      **Niles:** Soon... very soon... never.
    _Daphne glares, then softens._
     **Daphne:** Well... what's done is done.  I suppose we've all had our 
             romantic missteps.  But just to be clear: are there any more 
             secret sweethearts who I see on a regular basis?
      **Niles:** No.  Nobody. [_looking to Frasier for confirmation_] Nobody? 
             [_Frasier nods_] Nobody.
    **Frasier:** I certainly wouldn't count Anamari Hanratty at the Natural
             History Museum.
    _Daphne stares at him.  Niles is very uncomfortable._
      **Niles:**[_with quivering, pleading voice_] Frasier?
    **Frasier:** I said I _wouldn't_ count her.  I mean, they just made
             out.
    _Daphne glares at Niles again.  Frasier quickly tries to recover and
    grabs a book from the coffee table._
    **Frasier:** It was for charity!  But it doesn't really matter, I mean,
             the woman makes out with everyone. [_He places the book on
             the television_] You see, she's not really the kind of person
             that you'd...
    _He has eased himself to Martin's camera and quickly flashes it, 
    blinding all three of them.  Martin screams.  Frasier takes the 
    opportunity to quickly run out the door.

    Scene Five - KACL
    Frasier is entering the studio as Noel catches up to him._
       **Noel:** Hi, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Noel.
       **Noel:** Are you ready for _yeshiva_ tomorrow?  That means "school."
    **Frasier:** Yes indeed, I am, I'm looking forward to it.  Uh, listen, 
             Noel, I'm afraid I have some bad news about the, uh, science 
             fiction convention.
       **Noel:** Uh-oh!
    **Frasier:** Long story short, you see, I attended an art opening and a
             luncheon on Saturday, and even though I left the luncheon 
             early the traffic on the way to the convention was just awful 
             and by the time I got there, Mr. Bakula and all the others had 
             gone.
       **Noel:**[_deeply distressed_] No...!  You made a promise and you welshed
             on it!  Why'd you do it, Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** It's not really such a big deal is it, Noel?
       **Noel:** It's a _huge_ deal!  Who knows when I'll get to see Scott
             Bakula again?  I'll be the laughingstock of my clan!
    **Frasier:** Noel, try to remem... clan?  No, never mind, never mind!  
             Noel, surely you realize that _Star Trek_ is just a TV show.
       **Noel:** So was _Brideshead Revisited_!
    **Frasier:**[_furious, then_] You're angry, so I'm going to ignore that.  
             But with all due respect, Noel, perhaps weaning yourself off 
             science fiction might be the first step toward achieving a 
             genuine, meaningful, grownup person's life! [_realizing his 
             voice has risen_] Just a friendly suggestion.
       **Noel:** You're right.  You did your best and that's good enough for 
             me.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Noel.  So, you'll still be my tutor?
       **Noel:** Sure.
    **Frasier:** Good man. Thank you. [_tapping his shoulder_] I'll see you 
             tomorrow. 
    _He exits._
       **Noel:**[_menacingly_] Oh, yes, you will see me tomorrow.  And by the 
             rings of Septaurus Five you will pay, Dr. Crane.  You...
             [_he stops as Kenny walks by_] Oh hi, Kenny! ...will pay!
    _FADE OUT

    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Six - KACL
    Roz is with Eddie in her booth, "showing" him the controls._
        **Roz:** Okay, Eddie, hit the "talk" button. [_Eddie does so._] And 
             you're listening to "The Best of Crane" on KACL.  We'll 
             be back after these messages.
    _She goes to commercial.  Noel enters._
      **Noel:** Well, well.  The fox and the hound working together.  How
            ironic.
       **Roz:** I'm just taking care of him until Frasier gets back from
            Boston.  By the way, he left you something.
    _She grabs a large package from under the counter.  It looks like a 
    tall hatbox._
       **Noel:** He did?
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    _Noel opens the package.  He pulls out what appears to be a "Certificate
    of Authenticity, and then a black wig on a dummy head.  Noel appears
    thrilled with this gift._
        **Roz:** Wow.  A wig?  That's cruel even for Frasier.
       **Noel:** Cruel?  It's only the wig Joan Collins wore in _Star Trek_ 
             Twenty-Eight, "City on the Edge of Forever."  It's probably 
             still got her DNA in it.
        **Roz:**[_reading Frasier's note_] "Dear Noel.  I hope this begins to
             repay you for your great kindness to me, especially in light
             of my negligence.  Your friend, Frasier Crane."
       **Noel:** He called me "friend"?
        **Roz:** That's really sweet of him.
    _Noel, looking very guilty and remorseful, grabs his cell phone._
       **Noel:** I've got to call him before he delivers his speech.
        **Roz:** You taught him dirty words in Hebrew, didn't you?
       **Noel:** Uh, not quite.  They're the same words, but they're in
             Klingon.
        **Roz:** From _Star Trek_?  That's not even real.
       **Noel:** It's the fastest growing language on the planet!  This is 
             what you people don't understand. [_becoming passionate_] A
             man named Gene Roddenberry had a vision...
        **Roz:** CALL HIM!
    _Noel dials.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    **STAR MITZVAH**
    _Scene Seven - A synagogue in Boston.
    Frederick is chanting in Hebrew at the lectern._
    **Freddie:**_Yit-ba-rach shim-cha bi'fi kol chai.  Tamid l'o-lam va-ed.
             Ba-ruch a-tah, A-do-nai.  M'ka-deish ha-Sha-bat. Amen._
    _Frasier and Lilith are shown sitting together, beaming.  Rabbi Gendler, 
    who is administering the ceremony, rises and congratulates Frederick._
    **Gendler:**_Yasher Koach_ Frederick.  That was a beautiful passage,
             and a wonderful reading.  You honor us all by including...
    _Frasier's cell phone rings.  Embarrassed, he turns it off.  We see that 
    Daphne, Niles, and Martin are seated next to Frasier.  Frasier, Niles, 
    and Martin are wearing yarmulkes, while Lilith has a hat on._
    **Gendler:** You honor us all by including us in this important occasion,
             but you have chosen to especially honor your parents, Lilith
             and Frasier, by asking them to conclude this ceremony.  
             Lilith?
    _Lilith goes to the lectern._
     **Lilith:** Thank you.  I...
    _Martin's camera flash goes off, blinding Lilith, Freddie, and the 
    Rabbi._
    **Gendler:** Excuse me, would the photographer please refrain from taking 
             any more pictures until after the ceremony is over?
     **Martin:** Sorry, Rabbi.
     **Lilith:** Thank you.  I am very proud to participate in the coming-of-
             age ritual of my son, Frederick Gaylord Crane.
    _A boy laughs at this, interrupting.  Clearly, this is the Jeremy Berman
    of whom Freddie and Lilith had spoken earlier._
     **Jeremy:**[_catching himself_] Oh.
     **Lilith:** Frederick, on this momentous occasion, I can only look at you
             and see that innocent, chubby-legged toddler who once danced
             naked at the Boston Pops... the little boy whose favorite dish
             was "buh-sghetti." 
    _Freddie covers his face in embarrassment._
     **Lilith:** I can't count the number of bedtimes we spent cuddled together
             reading _The Cat in the Hat._ 
    _Freddie looks up at her in disbelief._ 
     **Lilith:** "The sun did not shine.  It was too wet to play, so we sat in 
             the house on that cold, cold wet day."
    _Frasier is also bemused by Lilith's antics.  Lilith breaks into tears.
    The Rabbi tries to console them._
     **Lilith:** Don't grow up!  Not yet! [_She emotionally hugs Freddie._]
     **Daphne:**[_to Niles_] Nice girlfriend you've got there.
      **Niles:** If you're trying to embarrass me, it's not going to work.
    _However, that ship sails when a very emotional Martin leans across and 
    hugs Niles._
     **Martin:** Come here, Daddy's little peanut man.
    **Frasier:**[_leading Lilith back to her seat_] It'll be all right.
    **Gendler:** We will conclude with a blessing from Frederick's father, 
             Frasier, who, though not of our faith, has chosen to follow 
             his son's fine example and deliver it in Hebrew.
    **Frasier:** Thank you. [_going to the lectern_] I'll keep this short.
    **Freddie:** Thanks, Dad.
    _Frasier pulls out the cards for his speech and places his hand on
    Freddie's shoulder._
    **Frasier:**_Pookh lod wih le koo.  Hach jahj cho-koov-moakh leng-lidge
             loo-Teb-jahj leng widge-vahd bel rahp shoave dah-nobe-poo-
             boagh._ [_in Hebrew_] _Shabbat shalom._
    _Frasier's delivery of Klingon has just the right "accent."  In the
    course of the speech, the Cranes look on admiringly while the rest
    of the congregation is highly confused._
     **Daphne:** Oh, that was lovely.
    **Gendler:** What was that gobbledygook?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's-it's a blessing for my son, "_Pookh Lod Wih Le Koo._ "
    **Gendler:** That means nothing.  It's gibberish.
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Jeremy:** That's not gibberish.  It's Klingon.
    **Gendler:** What?
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!
     **Jeremy:** Freddie's Dad just blessed him in Klingon.
    **Frasier:**[_mortified_] I'm terribly sorry.  I... I... will you excuse me,
             please? 
    _He quickly runs out of the hall.  Everybody, including the Rabbi, 
    can't contain their amusement._
    **Gendler:** Okay, everybody.  It's better to end with laughter than tears.  
             I don't know how they say it in outer space, but here we say 
             [_putting his hands toward Freddie's head_] _ahava_ and _shalom_ - 
             Love and Peace.  Dinner will be served in the multi-purpose 
             room in twenty minutes.
    _The Rabbi shakes Freddie's hand and walks off.  Jeremy approaches him._
     **Jeremy:** Hey that was awesome, _Gaylord._
    **Freddie:** Shut up, Berman.
     **Jeremy:** Seriously, your dad's Klingon is really good.
    **Freddie:** What did he say?
     **Jeremy:** Well, roughly translated, it says, "My dearest son, each day
             you redeem me.  May your journey be filled with the same joy,
             wisdom, and purpose you have given mine."  It's a lot more
             beautiful in the original Klingon, but it's still really cool.
    _CUT TO: Lilith and Frasier in the foyer._
     **Lilith:** Which one of us do you suppose humiliated him more?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think I did.  I've been trying to console myself with 
             the idea that without embarrassing parents, there'd be no
             psychology.  Poor kid.
     **Lilith:** Actually, today he is a man.
    **Frasier:**[_putting his arm around her_] He is, isn't he?
    **Gendler:**[_approaching them and taking their hands_] _Mazel Tov_.  
             You must be very proud - of your son, not yourselves.
     **Lilith:**[_as he exits_] We are, thank you, Rabbi.
    _Freddie approaches Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Frederick, uh, listen, I-I'm-I want to apologize.  Uh,
             there was this guy at the radio station.  He was going to
             teach me Hebrew...
    **Freddie:** You don't have to explain it, Dad.
    **Frasier:** Really?  I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. 
    **Freddie:** Berman translated your speech for me.  It was pretty good.
    **Frasier:** So you liked it?
    **Freddie:** Yeah.  I don't want to get all mushy or anything - I'm a 
             little old for that now, but... you know.
    **Frasier:** Yeah, I know. [_they embrace_]
     **Lilith:** Can you forgive me?
    **Freddie:** Yeah, for everything but naming me "Gaylord." [_they hug_]
      **Niles:**[_approaching_] That was lovely.
    _Niles moves to embrace Lilith.  Daphne steps in his way and hugs Lilith
    before Niles can get to her._
     **Martin:**[_offstage_] Hey everybody, look this way!
      **Niles:** Oh, no, no...!
    _The flash and high-pitched squeal follow, and the frame freezes with
    the whited-out faces of Niles, Daphne, Lilith, Frasier, and Freddie,
    shielding themselves from the blinding light.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    The sequence is a series of six stills taken by Martin's camera over 
    the course of the episode.  First we see Niles, seated, shielding his 
    face.  Second is the shot of Frasier coming in the door of his 
    apartment, taken aback by the flash.  Next, the shot taken by Frasier 
    of Martin, Daphne and Niles as he escaped the uncomfortable 
    conversation.  Then comes the shot of Lilith and Freddie at the 
    ceremony.  Finally, there is the shot that ended the episode.  
    
    This is not, however, the last still.  There is one final image of 
    Frasier with an angry, whited-out face and his hands extended and 
    clawed.  Apparently he is approaching Martin with the intent of 
    inflicting harm on either him or the camera.
