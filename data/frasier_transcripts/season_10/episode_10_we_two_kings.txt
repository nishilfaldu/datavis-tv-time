    [_Act 1_]
    
    [_Scene 1 - Caf e Nervosa
    Fade in.� Frasier enters and sees Roz seated at a table next to the counter.� 
    There is a waiter at the table with reindeer antlers on his head._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, hey Roz.� Can I join you?��� 
        **Roz:** � Sure.
    **Frasier:** � [_to waiter_] Ah... May I have a latte to go, please?� And I... I hope 
              that they're paying you extra to wear that. 
    
    [_He takes the seat across from Roz._] 
    
     Waiter:� No, but I was hoping that it would help me with my tips.
    **Frasier:** � Ah.� Well, as you know my tipping policy stands firmly on the twin 
              pillars of courtesy and efficiency.� But today I shall include - 
              [_tips him_] -- whimsy.� Merry Christmas. 
     Waiter:� God Bless You, sir.
    **Frasier:** � Well... [_The Waiter leaves._]��� 
        **Roz:** � I'm really surprised Frasier, I didn't think you'd go for something 
              kitschy like that.
    **Frasier:** � It's Christmas time I say let a thousand antlers bloom.��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh, well what a relief.
    
    [_She takes off her coat to reveal an elf costume._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh... oh, Roz.��� 
        **Roz:** � I'm working Santa's Toy Drive at the mall.� I'm an elf.
    **Frasier:** � Roz, if you needed extra cash you should have come to me.� I've got 
              plenty of odd chores around the house.��� 
        **Roz:**  [_looks disgusted_] It's not about money.� I'm volunteering.
    **Frasier:** � Oh!� Well, good for you, yes.��� 
        **Roz:** � Yeah, visiting Santa Claus at the department store was one of my 
              favorite memories as a kid.
    **Frasier:** � Mmmm... I always found him terrifying - and inquisitorial.��� 
        **Roz:** � When I was seven - my mom and dad took me to the mall to see Santa...
    **Frasier:** � Uh-huh.��� 
        **Roz:** � [_continuing_] They were going through their divorce at the time so they 
              were barely talking.� Anyway, when I sat down on his lap -- I started 
              to cry and he was just so nice, he made me feel safe and�protected... 
              I don't know, he just made me feel special.� So if I can do that for 
              just one little kid - you know?� I'd like to do that. [_She nods_]
    **Frasier:** � I'm sorry I laughed at you, Roz.� You should be very proud of yourself.��� 
        **Roz:** � Thank you, and I better go before I'm late.
    
    [_She gets up from her chair_]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, right.� You know what, I'm going too, I'll walk with you.
    
    [_He gets up from his chair as Roz picks up her coat from the back of her chair.� 
    As she passes Frasier, who is now at the counter, the bells on her costume jingle.� 
    He turns to see her at the door putting an elf hat on her head._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Actually Roz, [_She looks up_] why don't you go ahead?� I'm going to 
              get myself a scone.
    
    [_Roz leaves and Frasier turns back towards the counter as we fade out._] 
    
    [_Commercial Break_]
    
    [_Scene 2:�Frasier's apartment.� Frasier answers the door to Niles and Daphne.� 
    Martin is in his chair._] 
    
     **Daphne:** � Hello!� 
      **Niles:** � Hello, Hello.
    **Frasier:** � Oh, hi guys.� Good to see you.
    
    [_As they enter Frasier kisses Daphne on the cheek.� Daphne goes into the living room, 
    while Niles starts talking to Frasier._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Come on in.� 
      **Niles:** � Hey!� Ah, we were hoping to uh, use your wassail bowl.
    
    [_Frasier closes the door._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, I'm sorry.� I've already loaned it to Lawrence Emerson and his 
              mandrel-caroling group.� 
      **Niles:** � Well you can kiss that bowl good-bye.� Frasier, the Yule Tones are 
              the bad boys of Renaissance Christmas music.� Have you ever seen a 
              church common room after one of their performances?
    **Frasier:** � Oh... 
     **Martin:**  Why don't you just use the punch bowl?
    **Frasier:** � Because then it wouldn't be wassail, it would be punch. 
     **Martin:**  What's the difference?
    
    [_Niles makes noise in the background._] 
    
     **Daphne:** � Me dad used to say that punch would make you want to kiss the donkey 
              in the manger scene and wassail makes you want to check into the inn.
    **Frasier:** � That's very funny. [_walks over toward her_] Uh, listen Daphne, uh, 
              I was just wondering, is your mum partial to a traditional Cornwell 
              dressing?� You see, I'm thinking it'd go splendidly with the 12-lb. 
              Hungarian goose that I'm serving. 
    
    [_Martin gets up from his chair._] 
    
     **Daphne:** � [_laughs and walks over to Niles_] Mum is spending Christmas on a cruise, 
              an early Christmas present from Niles.� 
      **Niles:** � Yes, I didn't think she'd go for it, but apparently in international 
              waters you can play single deck Black Jack.
    **Frasier:** � Oh... ��
      **Niles:** � Um, actually Frasier, Daphne and I... would like to have you over at 
              OUR house for Christmas this year. 
     **Daphne:** � Yeah, we just put up our tree and everything looks so lovely and it 
              is our first Christmas as a married couple.
    **Frasier:** � Well, uh, as lovely as that sounds--� 
      **Niles:** � [_interrupting_] Oh, come on, why not?!
    **Frasier:** � Uh, well, Niles because it's a little late to be changing things, 
              isn't it?� Besides, we've always had Christmas here, it's a tradition.
    
    [_Martin is standing by the desk wearing glasses and holding an open dictionary._]
    
    **Martin:** "Wassail - a Christmas punch."
    
    [_Martin closes the dictionary and places it back on the desk._]� 
    
      **Niles:** � Frasier, you've had Christmas for the past nine years.
    **Frasier:** � Yes, but we agreed that when you hosted Thanksgiving, that we would 
              have Christmas here in its traditional setting.
    
    [_Daphne starts to say something, but doesn't._]� 
    
      **Niles:** � Well maybe it's time to start a new tradition.
    **Frasier:** � But I've had new stockings loomed for everyone - now there, you see, 
              you've made me spoil the surprise - and did anyone hear that I have 
              ordered a Hungarian goose?!
    
    [_Martin sits back in his chair._]� 
    
      **Niles:** � Which you are more than welcome to bring to our place.
    **Frasier:** � [_shouting_] It's not my date, it's dinner!
    
    [_Niles looks irritated._]
    
    **Frasier:** � [_continued_] Honestly Niles, I'm really quite affronted by this. 
              [_Walks over to the dinner table and sits down in a chair._] 
     **Daphne:** � [_turns to Niles and whispers_] If it means that much to him, why don't 
              we just let him keep it?� 
      **Niles:** � [_holding her wrist as she sits down on the couch and then lets go_] 
              No, No! [_walks over to Martin's chair_] There is no reason why just 
              this once we can't host Christmas at the Montana.� Frasier's just
              being a churl.
    **Frasier:** � You're the churl! 
     **Martin:** � [_aggravated_] You're both a couple of churls.� How �bout a compromise?  
              Say... morning at one house, afternoon at the other. 
     **Daphne:** � Well, that's a wonderful idea... but who gets morning and who gets 
              afternoon?
    
    [_Frasier jumps out of the chair that he is sitting in._]
    
    **Frasier & Niles:**� [_both raise a hand_] Morning! 
     **Daphne:** � [_gets up from couch_] I think Niles said it first.
    
    [_Niles turns to Frasier and goes "Ha!"� Frasier just gasps._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Dad, who do you think said it first? 
     **Martin:**  I'm sick of everything being a contest between the two of you.
    **Frasier:** � Alright then dad, you decide where we're having Christmas.� 
      **Niles:** � I'm fine with that.
    
    [_Daphne sits back down._]
    
    **Martin:** Alright... I will.� I need a few days to think about it... 
    
    [_Niles quickly turns his head, like "great."_] 
    
     **Martin:**  [_continues_] In the meantime, decision-making is thirsty work, sure 
              could use a beer.� 
      **Niles:** � [_runs towards the kitchen_] Oh!� I'll get it!
    **Frasier:** � [_runs after him_] NO!!� 
      **Niles:** � I got it!
    **Frasier:** � Oh, will you shut up! 
    
    [_They both exit into the kitchen._]
    
    **Martin:**  [_turns to Daphne_] A little trick their mom taught me.
    
    [_We fade out_]
    
    [_Commercial Break_]
    
    [_Scene 3 - The mall.� 
    We see Santa and a line of kids in front of him Roz is sitting down in front of him 
    in her elf costume._] 
    
     **Santa:** � Don't worry Margie, you don't need a chimney.� Santa always finds a 
             way in.� You have a Merry Christmas now.
    Margie:� Thank you Santa. 
     **Santa:**  Ho, Ho, Ho.
    
    [_Roz helps the little girl get down.� Frasier enters from the side with a bag._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Roz!� Hello.
    
    [_Roz walks over to him._]��� 
    
    **Roz:** � Oh! Hi, Frasier, listen, when I'm at the North Pole my name is Snowflake.
    
    **Frasier:** � It's a little on the nose, isn't it?
    
    [_They both laugh._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Anyway, I was at the mall and thought that I'd drop off a donation 
              for the Toy Drive.
    
    [_He hands Roz a present from his bag._]
    
    **Roz:** � Thank you very much. 
    
    [_She places the present with the others she turns back to Frasier and notices another 
    gift in his bag._] ��� 
    
    **Roz:** � Is this for us too?
    
    **Frasier:** � No, no, actually this is another "Dancing Santa" for dad.� His other 
              one got damaged.��� 
        **Roz:** � I thought you threw that thing over the balcony?
    **Frasier:** � Yes, which damaged it.
    
    [_A girl dressed in an elf costume walks over to them._]�� 
    
       **Santa:** � Ho, Ho, Ho.� Well Polly, what would you like Santa to bring you?
    **Girl Elf:** � He wouldn't have to bring me anything, just show up.���� 
         **Roz:** � Back off Twinkle, I saw him first.
    
    [_Twinkle walks away._]
    
    **Frasier:** � What's this?� Do I sense a little office romance... here at Santa's 
              Workshop?��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh, I wouldn't mind.� His name is Rick and he's so... sweet.
    **Frasier:** � And let me guess, he's also a hunk?��� 
        **Roz:** � Well I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him without his Santa getup yet. 
              But based on those eyes, [_looks at Rick, then turns back to Frasier_] 
              there's definite potential.
    
    [_Twinkle returns with gifts and places them with the others._]� 
    
      **Santa:** � Oh, Ho, Ho.� Santa needs his favorite helper elf.��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh, see that, I'm his favorite. [_laughs_]
    **Twinkle:** � Down Snowflake, I've got this one.��� 
        **Roz:** � Okay Twinkle, you go ahead. [_then, gasps_] Oh, no, is that a zit?
    
    [_As Roz rolls her eyes then leaves, Frasier drops his mouth open, while Twinkle puts 
    her hand to her face and glances up at Frasier._]
    
    [_We fade out_]
    
    [_Scene 4 - Caf e Nervosa.� 
    Frasier is sitting at the table next to the entrance.� Roz enters with her costume 
    in a garment bag._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, Snowflake.� Over here.
    
    [_Roz joins him._]��� 
    
        **Roz:** � Hi.� I just got back from the costume shop, I had to get my toes�
              re-curled. [_Places her bag across her chair_]
    **Frasier:** � Ah, which reminds me.� How are things with Mr. Claus, mm?��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh, I haven't had a chance to ask him out yet.
    **Frasier:** � What's the matter?� Low... elf-esteem?��� 
        **Roz:** � How long have you been waiting to say that?
    **Frasier:** � Two days.� I almost called you. [_both laugh_]
    
    [_Martin enters and Frasier notices Niles sitting over by the counter.� Martin goes 
    over to Niles, who is dusting off his chair._]
    
    **Frasier:** � What's this?� Niles with dad.� I knew it!��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh!� You guys aren't still fighting about -- Christmas?
    **Frasier:** � He's fighting.� I'm not fighting.��� 
        **Roz:** � Oh, what is the big deal?� Why don't you let him have Christmas?
    **Frasier:** � Because it is just so unfair.��� 
        **Roz:** � What's not fair?
    **Frasier:** � Oh, you wouldn't understand.��� 
        **Roz:** � Well come on Frasier, talk to me.� Use your words.
    **Frasier:** � Because, it's so egregious.��� 
        **Roz:** � Smaller words.
    **Frasier:** � I don't know.� Okay, look, it just seems that Niles is systematically 
              emptying my home.� We used to have Thanksgiving dinner there... gone!� 
              Daphne... gone!� If I let him have Christmas, I'll have nothing left.� 
              Just end up some... doddering old bachelor sipping tea and keeping the 
              apartment at a balmy seventy-eight degrees.��� 
        **Roz:** � And how is that different from now?
    
    [_Frasier gives her a look when he spies Niles giving Martin a thermos with a bow on 
    top, from a bag that is on the table._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Excuse me.� I smell skullduggery afoot.
    
    [_He walks over to Martin and Niles._] 
    
    **Frasier:** � Hey, dad. 
     **Martin:** � Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** � New thermos?� Niles, I'd have never thought you'd stoop so low.� 
      **Niles:** � I have no idea at what you're talking about.� Just buying dad some 
              coffee before driving him to work.
    **Frasier:** � You are trying to bribe dad to have Christmas at your place!
    
    [_Niles stands up._]
    
    **Niles:** � Oh, and what about you?� Buying him the Dancing Santa.� A surprising gift, 
            considering you threw his last one off the balcony!
    
    [_Martin gasps and Frasier steps back._] 
    
     **Martin:**  You did what?� That Santa never did anything to hurt you, all he ever 
              did was dance and try to make people happy.
    **Frasier:** � Yes, yes, alright dad. 
     **Martin:**  Why'd you do it--
    **Frasier:** � Oh, alright!� 
    
    [_N.B. Shouldn't Martin already know that Frasier threw his Dancing Santa off the 
    balcony?  Remember in the tag credits of Season Seven, Episode Eleven[[7.11] "The Fight Before Christmas"](/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_11/the_fight_before_christmas_2.html), Martin sees the hat on the balcony and looks down.  He then turns around to 
    see Frasier so he know that HE did it!__]
    
      **Niles:** � Why do you have to make everything so difficult?
    **Frasier:** � Excuse me Niles, but I have news for you.� Copernicus called and you 
              are not the center of the universe! 
     **Martin:**  Alright, you two knock it off!� 
      **Niles:** � Let's just settle this now.� [_whispering and motioning to Frasier_] 
              Sit down.� Dad, make your decision.
    
    [_Frasier sits down._] 
    
     **Martin:**  You know, I'm really disappointed in you guys.� I thought that if I 
              gave you a little time, you'd be mature enough to work this out on 
              your own.
    **Frasier:** � Well you were wrong! 
     **Martin:**  Alright, you know what?� I just made my decision.� I'm working Christmas.� 
              Jimmy Daily asked me to take his shift and I'm gonna do it because he'll 
              be happier with his family than I am with mine.
    
    [_Martin grabs his hat and new thermos and they all stand up._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, dad, you can't be serious? 
     **Martin:**  It's too late! [_people start to look, walks towards door_]� And you 
              don't have to drive me to work, I can call a cab.� I hope you're 
              happy! �You've ruined Christmas!
    
    [_Roz gives an "uh-oh" look, the cafe falls silent for a few seconds before people 
    start shouting insults.� Frasier turns back to Niles._]
    
    Waiter:� [_at counter_] Not nice.
    
    [_We fade out_]
    
    [_End of Act I_]
    
    [_Act II_]
    
    [_Scene 1 - Martin's Office.� 
    Niles and Frasier enter and Martin is at the desk._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Dad, uh, Niles and I would like to apologize.� It was untoward of us 
              to... to argue of where to have Christmas.� 
      **Niles:** � Our conduct was... was self-absorbed and boorish.� Not that we deserve 
              it, but please accept our apologies. 
     **Martin:**  Apologies accepted.
    **Frasier:** � Uh, thank you dad.� So you'll have Christmas with us? 
     **Martin:**  Oh, I'm afraid I can't. I promised Jimmy that I'd work, and I can't 
              go back on it.
    
    [_An elevator "dings" and an officer comes out._] �
    
    **Frasier:** � When do you start? 
     **Martin:**  Six A.M., twelve-hour shift.� It's double time, so I'm not complaining.� 
      **Niles:** � No, that's the whole day.
    
    [_Martin shrugs his shoulders at them as his supervisor comes over to them._]� 
    
    Supervisor:� Marty, I need you to let maintenance into the electrical closet on�
              seven. 
        **Martin:**  Will do.� See you boys later.
    
    [_Martin leaves as the officer takes his place._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Bye, dad.� 
      **Niles:** � Wow. [_sighs_] Christmas without dad.� This just won't be... Christmas.
    
    [_As they talk the officer behind them eavesdrops on their conversation._]
    
    **Frasier:** � I know.� He's always the first one under the tree.� Mom always said 
              that he was the biggest kid, because he could never wait to open his 
              presents.� 
      **Niles:** � Ha, ha.� [_sighs_] He always puts on a brave face, but I know he 
              especially misses mom on Christmas.
    
    [_Niles walks over to the door to leave, but Frasier stops him._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Niles. Where is it written that we have to have Christmas at either 
              of our homes?� 
      **Niles:** � The Thanksgiving Accord of 2002.
    **Frasier:** � No, no.� What I am saying... is dad has to work.� Why can't we bring 
              the holiday to him?� 
      **Niles:** � You mean just show up and surprise him?� I like that.� We can bring 
              all our gifts and, and food.
    **Frasier:** � Oh, better yet.� What if the gifts were already here?� 
      **Niles:** � But...� [_looks confused_]
    **Frasier:** � Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
    
    [_They both walk over to the tree that is next to the door, looking down at the 
    presents as they make their plan._]
    
    **Frasier:** � We take the gifts that are here and put them under the tree at my house.� 
              Get the real gifts and bring them here, all unbeknownst to dad.� 
      **Niles:** � Brilliant.
    **Frasier:** � Can't you just see us casually stopping by on Christmas morning?� 
              "Hello, dad.� Merry Christmas, oh it's just a shame that you had 
              to spend Chri- Hello?� What's this I spy?� A present for Martin?"� 
      **Niles:** � [_imitating Martin_] "That's not for me, those are fake."
    **Frasier:** � Well, here's another one.� One for Niles.� And one for Daphne.� 
      **Niles:** � Oh, geez it's a miracle.
    **Frasier:** � Oh, Niles.� It'll be the best Christmas we've ever had!� 
      **Niles:** � [_looks at hand_] Look I'm getting goose bumps!
    **Frasier:** � [_laughs then stops_] Oh no, Niles that's your pine rash, you're too 
              close to the tree.
    
    [_As they leave Niles scratches his ear._]
    
    [_Scene 2 -� Cafe Nervosa.� 
    Roz and Daphne are sitting at a table.� Rick is at the counter he turns around 
    and notices Roz._]
    
    **Rick:** � Hey!� Hi, Roz.
    
    [_Roz doesn't recognize him._]� 
    
      **Rick:** � [_continued_] It, it's me, Rick.�� 
       **Roz:** � Oh my God, Rick, I didn't even recognize you.� 
      **Rick:** � Ah, Roz and I volunteer down at the mall together.�� 
       **Roz:** � Rick plays Santa.� Daphne, this is Rick - Rick, Daphne.
    **Daphne:** � Oh, Roz has told me all about you.� Would you like to join us?� 
      **Rick:** � I'd love to, but I have to get back to my day job.
    **Daphne:** � Oh, what do you do?� 
      **Rick:** � I'm an investment banker.� Could you excuse me for just one second? 
    
    [_He goes back to counter._]
    
    **Daphne:** � Wow, Roz!� You never told me he was so gorgeous.�� 
       **Roz:** � Oh, I've never seen him out of his costume, before.
    **Daphne:** � He's successful and he's got great taste.� Those shoes... Enrico 
             Zangleones.
    
    [_Roz looks surprised._]
    
    **Daphne:** � [_continued_] Niles is teaching me.
    
    [_Rick comes back with a to-go cup._]
    
    **Rick:** � It's very nice meeting you, Daphne. [_she smiles and nods_] I'll see you 
           tonight, Roz?� Maybe we could take our break together.� I stuck a bottle�
           of schnapps in my locker. 
     **Roz:** � [_doesn't seem excited_] Yeah, maybe.
    **Rick:** � Is something wrong?� You don't like schnapps? 
     **Roz:** � No!� No, it's just so strange to see you without your beard.� You really 
           should grow one.� It would make your eyes twinkle.
    **Rick:** � Eh, I tried once.� Kinda came in... tough.� I looked like a dog on Rogaine.
    
    [_They all laugh.� Rick's laugh is horrible._]�� 
    
       **Roz:** � What was that?�
      **Rick:** � I-I laughed.�� 
       **Roz:** � That's your laugh?� 
      **Rick:** � Yeah.�� 
       **Roz:** � Wow, at the mall it's so booming.� 
      **Rick:** � I--I know, I hate that.� It really kills my throat. [_turns to Daphne_] 
             Very nice to meet you.
    **Daphne:** � Bye, Bye.� 
      **Rick:** � [_turns to Roz_] I'll see you later.�� 
       **Roz:** � Bye.
    
    [_He leaves._]
    
    **Daphne:** � Why are you being so weird?� He seems perfect. [_glances out the window_]�� 
       **Roz:** � I'd don't know, just wasn't what I was expecting.� Something missing.
    **Daphne:** � Like what?�� 
       **Roz:** � I don't know.� Well, at the mall he has all this warmth and he's got 
             this jolly sense of humor.� Oh, you should see him when he laughs, his 
             whole stomach shakes.
    **Daphne:** � Oh, my God.� You're in love with Santa Claus.� [_she giggles_]�� 
       **Roz:** � [_leans in_] No, I'm not.
    **Daphne:** � Well, it makes sense when you think about it.� Santa's the perfect man.� 
             He's a good listener, he likes to travel, he gives great presents. 
             [_giggles again_]�� 
       **Roz:** � Give me a break.
    **Daphne:** � Admit it.� You want the jelly belly. [_giggles_]�� 
       **Roz:** � Okay, don't be gross. 
    
    [_She grabs her purse from the floor and sets it on the table._]
    
    **Daphne:** � You want to bang-boots with the big boy. 
    
    [_She laughs as Roz gets up from her chair and grabs her coat from it._]�� 
    
       **Roz:** � [_puts her coat on_] I have to get to work.
    **Daphne:** � [_gets up from chair_] You want to get your paws on the Claus is more 
             like it.�� 
    
    [_Daphne grabs her coat and purse_]
    
       **Roz:** �  Stop it, Daphne! That's enough! [_she exits_]
    **Daphne:** � [_walks after her_] One more: you're a Ho, Ho, Ho.
    
    [_We fade out_]
    
    [_Scene 3 - Frasier's apartment.� 
    Eddie is on the floor next to Martin's chair drinking eggnog out of a punch bowl. 
    He is wearing a plaid outfit.� The camera pans up and we see Martin sitting in his 
    chair drinking out of a punch glass.� He finishes and sighs.� Frasier enters from 
    his room._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Dad! [_grabs coat from hook_] What are you doing still sitting there? 
              [_walks over behind the couch_] I told you ten minutes ago that we were�
              going out for Christmas Eve ice cream. 
     **Martin:**  Oh, I changed my mind. Eddie and I are too bloated from the nog.
    **Frasier:** � Well, then maybe we should, uh, take Eddie and uh, walk it off. �
              Come on, mister!� Let's go! 
    
    [_He walks over to the door and grabs his keys._]
    
    **Martin:** [_gets his cane and walks to the kitchen_] No, I'm gonna be up early for 
            work.� I sure could use somethin' to nibble on, though.
    
    [_We see the front door starting to open slowly.� Niles and Daphne are in the 
    hallway with an armload of presents they are trying to get in._]
    
    **Frasier:** � No, no, no, no. [_pushes them back into the hall_]� 
      **Niles:** � Stop pushing.� Stop pushing.
    
    [_Frasier shuts the door._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Listen.� Dad's still here, I couldn't get rid of him.� You'll have to 
              come back in an hour.� 
      **Niles:** � N--N-- No.� We can't do that.� The maintenance man in dad's building 
              was so nervous about us taking these out of the lobby, I promised him 
              we'd have our real gifts under his tree by ten o'clock.
    **Frasier:** � Alright, what we need is a really good distraction. [_thinks for a 
              moment_] I'll tell you what.� Knock when you think of one. 
    
    [_He goes back into the apartment and shuts the door.� Martin comes back into the 
    kitchen with a bowl._] 
    
     **Martin:**  What were you doing out there?
    **Frasier:** � Nothing.� Thought I heard the door knock. 
    
    [_The second he finishes saying this, the door knocks.� Frasier jumps._]
    
    **Martin:** Hey, that's pretty good.
    
    [_Frasier opens the door and Niles and Daphne come in, with no gifts._]
    
    **Frasier:** � Oh, hello guys.� Dad, look who it is.� It's Niles and Daphne. 
     **Martin:**  I see 'em.
    **Frasier:** � So, what brings you two here?� 
      **Niles:** � Good question, Frasier.� Daphne? 
     **Daphne:** � I need your father's help with a present, and that's what we're doing 
              here.� 
      **Niles:** �Exactly, yes. 
     **Daphne:** � [_goes over to tree and picks up a present_] Come on Martin, we can do 
              this in my old room. 
     **Martin:**  No, problem. 
    
    [_He follows her._]
    
    **Niles:** � Okay, now!� [_he goes over to grab some presents_]� Real presents go out 
            in the hall by the door, fake presents under the tree.
    
    [_Niles takes the presents into the hallway._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Niles, did you notice my Christmas village?� Would you like to see 
              smoke waft out of the cobbler's chimney?
    � **Niles:** � [_places gifts next to the elevator_] Uh, maybe later. [_grabs presents 
              from the pile next to the apartment door and brings them in_] Frasier, 
              I have to warn you.� These prop boxes are heavy - some idiot weighed 
              them down with bricks.
    
    [_He passes Frasier who has a pile of presents._]
    
    **Frasier:** [_takes his presents into the hall_] Just with our luck, we get the only 
             lobby decorator in all of Seattle. 
    
    [_He places his presents next to the apt. door and grabs the ones that Niles had just 
    placed next to the elevator.� He brings those into the apartment and passes Niles._]� 
    
    **Frasier:**  How much time do you think Daphne can buy over dad?
    � **Niles:** � Not much. [_stops at door_] They're just putting batteries in the digital 
              camera that we're giving you. [_gives an "oops" look, then he does his 
              famous grin_]� Act surprised. [_goes into the hall_]
    **Frasier:**  Right! [_places his presents by the tree_]
    
    [_Daphne yells as she comes into living room with Martin following._]
    
     **Daphne:** � I said I'd get them!!
     **Martin:**  Oh, you'll never find them.� How could you ask me to put batteries in 
    ����������when you didn't bring any batteries? [_Niles enters with an armload of 
    ����������presents as he sees Martin_]� Now, boys, you know the rules.� No shaking 
    ����������the presents.
    **Frasier:**  You see Niles, I told you.
    
    [_Niles pretends to shake the gifts.� Daphne comes out of the kitchen._]
    
     **Daphne:** � I found them.� Let's go.� [_Martin and her head back, but Frasier�stops her._]
    
    **Frasier:**  [_whispering_] Daphne!� No more surprises.
     **Daphne:** � Oh, you mean like finding your father here, when the apartment's
    ����������supposed to be empty?! [_goes back to the bedroom_]
    **Frasier:**  Well, you can blame that on the nog!! 
    
    [_Niles places presents under�the tree as he picks up a new pile._]
    
    � **Niles:** � [_places them in the hall near the elevator_] Frasier, [_grunts and picks 
              up a pile next to the apt. door_] I think I'm going to sleep tonight, 
    ����������I feel like I'm ten years old.
    
    [_Frasier takes presents to hall, Niles looks at him funny, like he notices that 
    Frasier has the wrong gifts._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Yes.� Only this time we have the merry chance of playing Santa. 
    
    [_Frasier laughs as he puts his presents with the ones next to the elevator and picks up
    a new pile that is next to the apt. door._] 
    
    **Frasier:**  Niles, I'm so sorry that we almost ruined Christmas with our arguing.� 
    
    [_Niles passes Frasier with a pile of presents.� He then looks at the presents that 
    Frasier has and stops walking._]
    
    � **Niles:** � Stop!� 
    **Frasier:**  What?
    � **Niles:** � I just took that from under the tree.
    **Frasier:**  No, you didn't.
    � **Niles:** � Yes, I did.� I know, �cause that's real and fake ones are in a pile 
    ����������by the door.
    **Frasier:**  The elevator door?
    � **Niles:** � No, the apartment one!� That's where all the fake ones are!
    **Frasier:**  Great.� Now what do we do?
    � **Niles:** � Well here, alright, you take these.
    **Frasier:**  Yes.
    � **Niles:** � I take those.
    
    [_They mumble words as they go in the wrong directions._]
    
    **Frasier:**  What are we...
    � **Niles:** � Where do we go?
    **Frasier:**  How the hell should I know?
    
    [_Martin starts talking as Niles and Frasier put both piles under the tree._]
    
     **Martin:**  That's a flat head and I need a Phillips head. [_Daphne follows._]
    � **Niles:** � [_he motions Frasier to place the presents under the tree_] See, I told 
    ����������you, if you rearrange them they look fuller. [_Makes it look like he was 
              arranging them_]
    **Frasier:**  Yes, yes, I see what you mean, Niles.� It's all a matter of perspective.
     **Martin:**  Wow, it looks like twice as many.� Uh, put them back the way they were 
    ����������and show me how you did that. [_he motions with his finger_]
     **Daphne:** � [_comes out of the kitchen_] Got the Philips.� Let's go.� 
    
    [_She motions for them to "move it along" while Martin heads back to the bedroom._]
    
    � **Niles:** � He could be an assassin in those slippers.
     **Daphne:** � Are you two going to switch the presents?� Or are you going to argue 
    ����������about whose Christmas village is bigger? [_she heads to the bedroom_]
    **Frasier:**  [_gasps as Niles picks up a pile of "real" presents from under the tree_] 
    ����������I knew it!� You didn't compliment mine, because you have one too.
    � **Niles:** � [_turns around with presents in hand_] I didn't compliment yours, because 
    ����������yours is so poorly laid out!!
    **Frasier:**  Alright, alright.� We don't have time for this, now which ones are which?
    � **Niles:** � Oh, oh!� I have them all organized.� Here, take those out. [_hands Frasier 
              the pile of gifts and gets some for himself to take out_]
    **Frasier:**  Are you sure?
    � **Niles:** � Yes, absolutely.� These-these are the real ones.� These go to dad, 
    ����������out in the hall and we'll take them together.� [_both go to the hall_]
    **Frasier:**  Fine. alright, alright.� [_starts to mumble_]
    � **Niles:** � Fine, then here. [_sets gifts down in the hall_] Now we're all set.� 
    ����������[_takes gifts from Frasier_] All the fake ones are under the tree.
    **Frasier:**  Yes, now you put those in the elevator.� I'll tell Daphne the coast 
    ����������is clear. 
    
    [_Frasier shuts the door.� Daphne comes out of the bedroom with Martin following, 
    sounding sorrowful._] 
    
     **Daphne:** � Do you have any idea how much I paid for that?
     **Martin:**  Well, it's not my fault.� Those little plastic hinges snap off if you 
    ����������look at them.
     **Daphne:** � Now what am I supposed to give as a gift, now?
     **Martin:**  Oh, stop cryin'.� Just put a little duct tape on it and it'll be good 
    ����������as new.
     **Daphne:** � [_shouting_] It was new! [_goes to kitchen_]
    **Frasier:**  [_runs to kitchen_] Here Daphne, I'll help you find the tape.
    
    [_Eddie is at the front door barking.� Martin walks over to the coat rack._]
    
    **Martin:**  What's the matter, boy?� Too much eggnog, huh? [_laughs_] Okay. [_yells 
             to kitchen_] Hey, Daph.  Be sure and to use the silver duct tape, not 
    ���������the brown.� The silver will match the camera- [_goes over to the door_] 
    ���������oop! - the present.� I'm takin' Eddie for a walk.
    
    [_Frasier runs out of kitchen to catch Martin._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Wait, dad!� I'll do that.� You should just relax.
     **Martin:**  No, that's alright.� I need the fresh air. [_opens door, we see Niles_]� 
    ����������Uh-oh.� What's this, more presents?� Is this why you were trying to 
    ����������keep me busy back there?
    � **Niles:** � [_not sure of what to do_] Yes.
     **Martin:**  [_laughs_]�� Oh, ohh, why, you didn't need to do that.� Bring 'em on in.� 
    ����������Frasier, give your brother a hand.� 
    
    [_Frasier goes into hall as Niles comes in with a pile of presents.� They give 
    each other looks._]
    
    **Martin:**  [_Frasier comes in with a pile_] Mix them all up, so they'll look fuller.
    
    [_Niles turns around at the tree to give Martin a look._]
    
    **MERRY CHRISTMAS, STEVE!**
    
    [_Scene 4 - Frasier's Apartment, Christmas Morning.� 
    Fade in.� Doorbell rings and Frasier opens the door to Niles and Daphne._]
    
    All Three:� Merry Christmas!
    
    [_Niles and Daphne come in.� Frasier kisses Daphne on the cheek, Frasier then 
    hugs Niles._]
    
    � **Niles:** � Hey.� Hi. 
    **Frasier:**  Niles.� So... how are you?
    � **Niles:** � Well, uh, tired and a little poorer. [_Frasier sighs as he walks over 
              to the coat rack_] Had to bribe the maintenance man at dad's building 
    ����������to get him to stay late.� Which reminds me, on your next show you have 
              to give something called a� Shout Out to a Steve Gomez. [_he shrugs his 
              shoulders_]
    **Frasier:**  [_has coat in hand_] Right. [_walks to door_]
     **Daphne:** � [_laughs_] This is so exciting,� I can't wait to see the look on your 
    ����������Father's face when we go over there and surprise him.
    
    [_As they head out the door Martin comes out from the hall dressed in matching 
    pj's and robe._]
    
    **Martin:**  Merry Christmas!
    
    [_Daphne, Niles and Frasier quickly turn towards him in shock._]
    
    **Frasier:**  Dad, uh, what are you doing here?
    � **Niles:** � [_looks at his watch_] Yes, aren't you supposed to be at work? [_laughs slightly_]
     **Martin:**  [_walks down the steps_] Oh, the boss called, I don't have to go in.� 
    ����������Seems he was feeling guilty about me missing Christmas with my family.� 
    ����������[_picks up a present_]� Ooh, heavy.� This must be a good one, [_walks over 
              to his chair and sits down_] unless it's a book.
     **Daphne:** � But, who's covering the desk?
     **Martin:**  Nobody, she's shut down tight 'til tomorrow.� Now, I have just enough 
    ����������patience to wait for the cocoa before I start tearing into these.
    
    [_The others look horribly sad._]
    
     **Niles:** � Um... dad?
    **Martin:**  [_sad_] Don't tell me there's no cocoa.
    
    [_Niles, Daphne and Frasier look at each other._]
    
    [_Scene 4 - Martin's Office.� Daphne, Niles, Martin and Frasier are standing at the 
    entrance.� Daphne is knocking at the glass doors._]
    
     **Daphne:** � [_Frasier taps on the door, too_] Hello?� Hello?
    � **Niles:** � You'd think there'd be a custodian or someone in there.
     **Martin:**  Nah, I knew it'd be a long shot.� There won't be anyone in 'til 
    ����������tomorrow morning.
    **Frasier:**  Sorry, dad.
     **Martin:**  Oh, forget it.� It was a really sweet gesture.� Would have been terrific, 
    ����������but... 
    
    [_He places a hand each on Niles and Frasier's shoulders.� Daphne turns and smiles._]
    
    **Frasier:**  [_looks up, then back down_] You know, we could throw a brick through 
    ����������the glass, but they're all wrapped up under our tree. [_they all smirk_]
    
    [_We fade out_] 
    
    **End Credits:�**
    The family is sitting around the Christmas tree at the office.� Martin hands Daphne 
    a big red box, she lifts the lid and pulls out a pink robe, while Frasier, who is 
    next to her opening a gift and finds the digital camera with duct tape on in.�

    we see a few more people pass.� (It is the next morning) Martin gets up and takes 
    off the robe that he has on and Niles looks at his watch.� Martin then goes over 
    to the front desk.� The rest of the family stay and Niles picks up another gift.
