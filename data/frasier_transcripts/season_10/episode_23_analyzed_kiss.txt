## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    **Title Card:** The tip of the Space Needle glows.
    _ACT ONE
    
    FADE IN:
    
    Scene One -- Radio Studio
    Frasier is nearing the end of his show.
    _
    **Frasier:** Well, I think we've got time for one last caller.  Roz, who have 
             we got?
    _He looks over and sees Roz on the phone, turned away from him and writing 
    on a pad._
        **Roz:** Mmm-hmm...  mmm-hmm...
    _Peeved, Frasier tosses a pencil against the glass to get her attention.  
    She notices him, but waves him off._
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose I'll be fielding this last one myself.  Let's try 
             line two. [_pushes button_] Go ahead, caller, your name and problem, 
             please.
      **Ernie:** [_v.o._] Yes sir, my name's Ernie, and I'm real angry at my dog.
    **Frasier:** Okay, Ernie.  Uh, very often when people have feelings towards 
             their pets it often reflect feelings they have about themselves 
             and their place in society.  So tell me, why are you angry at 
             your dog?
      **Ernie:** [_v.o._] Well, he keeps telling me to take off my foil helmet.
    _Beat._
    **Frasier:** Would you hold on, Ernie?  Um, someone will come on the line with 
             the number of an expert in this sort of situation.  Let's try, uh, 
             line four. [_presses button_]
        **Roz:** [_v.o._] Oh yes, of course I'm interested!  I'll fax my resume right 
             over!
    _Frasier mutes the line._
    **Frasier:** Well, the news is up next, followed by the market update with 
             Julia Wilcox.  That's it for me today.  This is Dr.  Frasier 
             Crane saying, good day and good mental health.
    _He goes off the air and glares at Roz, who mouths, "I'm sorry."  Kenny 
    enters with some copies, which he lays on Frasier's console._
      **Kenny:** Another great show, doc.
    **Frasier:** Did you even listen?
      **Kenny:** You don't have to eat every Big Mac to know it's a delicious 
             hamburger sandwich.
    _Roz enters._
    **Frasier:** Roz, what's going on?
        **Roz:** I'm sorry, but they want to interview me for the program director 
             job at KPXY.
    **Frasier:** Well... that's great, but I didn't even know you were looking.
        **Roz:** I wasn't!  They just called me, out of the blue!   I-I'm actually 
             shocked, because I have very limited experience in management.  
             But, well, Kenny's in management, how hard can it be?
    _Frasier nods in agreement._
      **Kenny:** Hey, it's not that easy.  I know it looks like a monkey can do 
             my job, but it can't.  True story.
    _Kenny exits._
    **Frasier:** Well, gosh, Roz, I, I must say I've got some mixed feelings about 
             this.  I mean, I couldn't be happier that you're finally getting 
             the recognition you deserve, but I'm gonna miss you.  
        **Roz:** Oh, let's wait ï¿½til there's a real offer before we break out the 
             Kleenex and champagne.
    _Julia enters._
      **Julia:** Well, Roz, Kenny told me about your job interview.  Good luck.
        **Roz:** Oh, I get it.  It'll be good luck because if I get the job, 
             I'll be gone.
      **Julia:** No, it sounds like a good position for you.
        **Roz:** Right, cause I get into a lot of sexual positions with a lot of 
             guys.
      **Julia:** I'm saying congratulations.
        **Roz:** Oh.  Thank you. 
    _She crosses back to her booth._
        **Roz:** [_sotto voce to Frasier_] What's her problem?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I...
    _Roz closes her door._
    **Frasier:** Well, you're being uncharacteristically decent today.  You all 
             right?
      **Julia:** I'm fine. [_then_] All right, I might as well tell you before he 
             does.  Avery and I broke up.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Gosh, uh, what happened?
      **Julia:** I got tired of listening to him promise he'd leave his wife.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry.  I realize you must be going through...
      **Julia:** Oh, I don't need your sympathy.  I'm not one of your pathetic 
             code three whackadoos.
    **Frasier:** I was just trying to help.  No need to insult my callers.
    _Roz sticks her head back in._
        **Roz:** Foil Helmet Guy says his dog needs to speak to you.
    _Unable to say anything to Julia, Frasier just motions vaguely towards 
    Roz's booth before exiting.
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    FADE IN:
    
    Scene Two -- Cafe Nervosa
    The cafe is packed -- the line to the counter reaches back to the door, 
    and every table is occupied. Frasier enters.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh, excuse me... 
    _He threads his way over to the table in the rear, where Daphne is seated 
    alone._
    **Frasier:** Hi, Daph.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Gosh, I've never seen this place so crowded.  What's the 
             occasion?
     **Daphne:** It's Mum's day off.  Apparently there was a mass e-mail.
    **Frasier:** So, is Niles going to be joining us?
     **Daphne:** No, he's taking your father to the shooting range.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, yes, of course, I'd forgotten.  He asked me to take him, 
             but then I suggested that when it comes to guns, perhaps he would 
             prefer someone of Niles's...  caliber. [_chuckles_] I'm in rare form 
             today.
     **Daphne:** You should see this place when they know you're not coming.
    _As a couple leaves one of the tables in the middle, Julia comes in, 
    talking on her cell phone._
      **Julia:** No, Avery...  two-thirds of the work on that program is mine!  
             Well, I don't have to prove it, it's a fact!  Oh -- oh, yeah?  
    _Another couple from the line tries to claim the table, but Julia drops 
    her satchel on it._
      **Julia:** Well, I should have expected as much from a man who wears leopard 
             print bikini briefs! [_holds up phone, to the whole caf e_] Avery 
             McManus wears shiny, acetate, man-panties!
    _She sits._
    **Frasier:** [_to Daphne_] Excuse me.
    _He goes over to Julia's table._
    **Frasier:** Is everything okay?
      **Julia:** No.  Now that I've dumped your bastard accountant, he's trying 
             to cut me out of our software program.  
    **Frasier:** Software program?
      **Julia:** We -- mostly me -- developed a proprietary method for analyzing 
             price/volume momentum -- I call it vector scaling -- that can 
             quantify the likelihood of longer-term trends.  Do you realize 
             what that means?
    **Frasier:** [_at a loss_] It's good.
      **Julia:** That program is my baby, I have been working on it for months.  
             I think your bastard accountant has been using me all along.  
             Thanks for setting us up!
    **Frasier:** I did no such thing!
      **Julia:** You know what I ought to do?  I ought to go down to his office, 
             demand my files, and then trash the place!
    _She rises angrily, Frasier restrains her._
    **Frasier:** Just a second, just a second, just sit down.  Sit down, please.  
             [_she does_] Take a moment to calm down before you make any rash  
             decisions.
      **Julia:** In a few hours, I'm leaving town for a week.  There's no way 
             I'm leaving your bastard accountant in control of those files.  
    **Frasier:** All right, well, if you insist, then perhaps I should go with 
             you.  Maybe I can help facilitate things.
      **Julia:** Why?  What's in it for you?
    **Frasier:** Nothing!  Surely you can conceive of the possibility that 
             someone might want to just do something nice for you?
      **Julia:** You and Avery are in this together, aren't you?
    **Frasier:** Of course not!  You're not being rational, you know.  Perhaps 
             Avery is just holding your program hostage because he feels 
             hurt.  Perhaps this is his clumsy way of trying to initiate a 
             dialogue.
    _Julia looks at him thoughtfully._
      **Julia:** You really do try to see the best in everyone, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I do.
      **Julia:** So, what do you see when you look at me?
    **Frasier:** Well...  I see a woman who's been hurt, not once but many times.  
             A woman who finds it so difficult to trust someone, she won't 
             allow herself to be vulnerable.  A woman... [_Julia gets up and 
             walks out_] whose eyes are going to get stuck if she keeps 
             rolling them like that!
    _He gets up and follows her.
    
    FADE OUT._
    **THE BANG GANG**
    _FADE IN:
    
    Scene Three -- Shooting Range
    Martin is standing in a booth, firing an automatic.  Niles is standing 
    behind him, looking extremely uncomfortable.  Both are wearing ear 
    protectors and range glasses.
    _
     **Martin:** Ah, look at that grouping!
      **Niles:** Hey, uh, Dad, you about ready to go?
     **Martin:** I guess I've still got the touch.  Hey, Niles, you ought to 
             give it a try.
      **Niles:** Thanks, Dad, you know how I feel about handguns.  They breed 
             violence.  
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, this is just simple target shooting, that's all.  
    _He puts down his gun and calls his target back._
     **Martin:** Ha-ha, yeah!  Here's one dirtbag isn't going to be selling crack 
             at any schoolyards anytime soon.
    _Three men standing at the next booth come over, having heard Niles._
        **Red:** You should listen to the man.  Shooting's a great sport. [_shaking 
             hands_] Red Brewer.  And these clowns here are Mitch and Wayne.
    _Niles shakes their hands, ad-libbing hellos._
      **Niles:** I'm Niles Crane, and this is my father, Martin Crane.
     **Martin:** [_shaking hands_] Oh, hi, how you doing, guys?
        **Red:** Listen Niles, let me show you how to do this.  I think you'll 
             enjoy it.  It's pretty simple.  
    _He picks up his own pistol and demonstrates as he talks._
        **Red:** You just take a solid stance, hold the grip firmly, steady your 
             gun hand with your other, fingers to fingers, thumbs to thumb, 
             focus on the front sight, and squeeze the trigger.
    _He fires, making Niles jump._
        **Red:** Okay, you try.
      **Niles:** Oh, you know, no offense, but I, uh, I just, I'm not real 
             comfortable with guns.
        **Red:** You know, Mitch used to be that way, too.
      **Mitch:** Yeah, the only weapon I'd go near was a bow and arrow.
      **Niles:** [_interested_] I, uh, I got an archery badge at day camp.
        **Red:** This is like archery, but safer.  The weapon's more stable, 
             and you're in a controlled environment.
     **Martin:** Go on, give it a try, son.
      **Niles:** Well, I, uh, just -- I'll do one little one.
    _He steps up and takes Red's pistol._
        **Red:** Just remember: stance, grip, aim, relax, shoot.
      **Niles:** Okay. [_mimics Red_] Stance, grip, aim, relax... [_tilts his head 
             to the left_] shoot.
    _He pulls the trigger.  The recoil knocks him back about a foot, but Martin
    and the guys look pleased._
      **Niles:** Did I do it?
        **Red:** You not only did it, you hit the target. [_points_] See?  Sixth 
             ring out.  Look at the kid, he hit the target his first time.
      **Mitch:** Not bad, kid.
      **Wayne:** Way to go, kid.
     **Martin:** That's my kid!
      **Niles:** That was a unique experience.  I'm sure I'll dine out on that 
             story for months.
        **Red:** Don't quit now, go again.  But remember, this time, squeeze the 
             trigger, don't pull.
      **Niles:** Okay.
    _He takes his stance again, with his head cocked to the left again._
      **Niles:** Squeeze...
    _He fires again, this time staying on balance._
        **Red:** Wow, you're pretty good at this!  The kid's a natural, am I 
             right?
      **Niles:** Can I go again?
        **Red:** Yeah.
    _Niles, more confident, fires one shot after the other.  He experiments, 
    tilting his head to the right and sighting with his other eye, as we:
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    FADE IN: 
    
    Scene Four -- Avery's Office
    Julia is pacing outside Avery's office door, when Frasier comes in.
    _
      **Julia:** What took you so long?
    **Frasier:** I was looking for street parking.  Do you have any idea how much 
             this garage charges?
    _Julia knocks on the door.  No answer.  She knocks again._
      **Julia:** Avery's not here.
    **Frasier:** Oh, great, it cost me three-fifty to find that out.
      **Julia:** No, it's good.  It'll make it easier for me to get my program 
             back.
    **Frasier:** What do you mean?
      **Julia:** I know his keypad code. [_starts to enter it_]
    **Frasier:** Wh-wh-what?  That is breaking and entering!
      **Julia:** Oh, if you're so scared, why don't you just leave?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm-I'm not scared!  I...
    _The door opens, and Julia enters the office.  Frasier follows her in.
    
    RESET TO: Office
    
    Julia starts to rifle through Avery's desk._
    **Frasier:** I'll have you know I've had my fair share of escapades.  Back 
             in med school I once dressed a cadaver in cap and gown and...  
      **Julia:** [_finds a disk_] Oh, here's my program!  Okay, good. [_logs on the 
             computer_] Now, just in case he backed it up, I am going to 
             delete everything from his hard drive.
    **Frasier:** Julia, I-I-I beg you to rethink this.  I realize you're angry 
             at Avery-
      **Julia:** I'm not feeling anger.  Just the peace that comes with knowing 
             that Avery will be royally screwed -- by me.
    _Sounds are heard outside the door._
    **Frasier:** There's somebody at the door!
    _Julia points him to the closet.  They rush in as someone outside is 
    heard entering the code.
    
    RESET TO: Closet
    
    They go inside and close the door.  Julia cracks the door and peeks 
    outside, then closes the door softly.
    
    They both whisper:_
      **Julia:** It's the cleaning woman.  I thought so, I've hidden from her 
             before.
    **Frasier:** Julia, there's still time to end this.  
      **Julia:** Shh!
    **Frasier:** Look, you know that what you're doing is wrong.  You should 
             just get out now before more harm is done.
      **Julia:** Will you shut up?  It's pointless to hide in a closet if the 
             people outside can hear you!
    **Frasier:** You're going to get caught.
      **Julia:** Because you won't shut up!
    **Frasier:** It's never too late to do the right thing.  No matter how low 
             someone else sinks, joining them there does not make things 
             better.
    _Julia does not shush him.  Suddenly she wraps her arms around his neck,
    and kisses him, closing her eyes.  He is caught off guard, but 
    reflexively returns the kiss and puts his arms around her...
    
    Outside, the door closes.  She breaks away and exits back into the office.
    Frasier stands there, totally bewildered.  He feels his lips for a moment
    as if to check to see if it really happened.  Then he follows her into
    the office.  
    
    RESET TO: Office
    The cleaning lady is gone, and Julia is back typing at the computer._
    **Frasier:** What was that?
      **Julia:** What?
    **Frasier:** You kissed me.
      **Julia:** I was trying to shut you up.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no.  I've been kissed to shut me up before.  This was not 
             that.
    _The computer beeps._
      **Julia:** Got it.  All files deleted. [_pause_] You know, that didn't make 
             me feel as good as I thought.
    **Frasier:** That's because you know you did the wrong thing.
    _Julia shoves the contents of the desktop onto the floor, breaking the 
    computer and scattering files._
      **Julia:** [_happy_] Ah, that's better.
    _She runs out, followed by Frasier.

    FADE IN:
    
    Scene Five -- Cafe Nervosa
    The cafe is still packed.  Frasier is seated at a table when Roz comes
    in.
    _
        **Roz:** Well, it doesn't look like I'll be leaving KACL anytime soon. 
             [_crosses to the counter_] Coffee to go, please?
    **Frasier:** Well... dear lord, what-what happened, Roz?
        **Roz:** [_sits with him_] Turns out the person who's interviewing me is 
             a guy I've slept with.
    **Frasier:** What are the odds?
        **Roz:** [_gives him a look, then_] It was ten years ago, at a convention 
             in Cancun.  We were all hammered.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm surprised you even remember him.
        **Roz:** Well, it's hard to forget when you wake up with a nametag on 
             your pillow that says, "Hola!  My name is Woody Wiswell."
    **Frasier:** So what's the problem?
        **Roz:** There's just something weird about it.  I don't know, maybe I'm 
             just freaking myself out because I'm not sure I'm ready for this 
             job.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course you are, Roz.  I mean, come on, don't doubt 
             yourself.  Listen, they're the ones that called you, right?
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** You go down there and you get that job.  You're going to make a 
             great program director.
        **Roz:** You really think I will?
    **Frasier:** Of course I do.  Even though...  I wish you could stay with me 
             forever.  I'm going to miss you so much, Roz.
        **Roz:** [_excited_] Oh, stop it!  I don't even have the job yet, you're 
             gonna jinx it! [_a waiter brings her coffee_] Thank you. [_to 
             Frasier_] Listen, I'd better go and get my presentation together 
             so I can impress Woody Wiswell.
    **Frasier:** Seems to me you've impressed him already.
    _As Roz leaves, she passes Julia, entering._
    **Frasier:** Julia--
      **Julia:** [_quickly_] Hello. [_crosses to the counter_] Can I have a latte to 
             go, please?
    _Frasier gets up and stands beside her._
    **Frasier:** Listen, Julia, Julia, I've been dying to talk to you all week 
             long about what happened in Avery's office.  Obviously something 
             is going on, and I have several hypotheses. [_Julia gets her 
             coffee and starts adding sugar_] It could be displaced passion, 
             frustration from a failed relationship, or an adrenaline-induced 
             action as a result of stress we were both suffering from...
      **Julia:** [_finishes_] Oh, Frasier, for once in your life, would you please 
             shut up?
    _She exits, passing Martin and Niles entering._
      **Julia:** Hello.
    **Martin/Niles:** Oh, hi./Hello.
    **Frasier:** Hi, guys.
      **Niles:** Hey, Frasier.
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, you look a little down.  Everything okay? [_to a 
             waiter_] Uh, two coffees, please.
    **Frasier:** Dad, if you had any perspicacity whatsoever, you would know 
             that this expression is merely ruminative perplexity.
     **Martin:** My bad.
    _They sit._
    **Frasier:** It's nothing serious.  I'll work it out.
      **Niles:** You know where I like to work things out?  The shooting range.
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, Niles, are you still going down there?  I thought 
             you hated guns.
      **Niles:** Oh, believe me, I never expected I'd like it as much as I do.  
             But when you're in that booth, focused on-on precision, and 
             accuracy, it's not dissimilar to a kind of meditation. [_Frasier 
             looks intrigued_] Wouldn't you agree, Dad?
     **Martin:** [_shrugs_] I just like to shoot stuff, son.
      **Niles:** Fair enough. [_to Frasier_] You should join us.  There's a great 
             bunch of guys I shoot with.  I think you'd like them.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm not sure I'd fit in with a bunch of trigger-happy gun 
             nuts.
      **Niles:** Now, don't stereotype them.  These are decent family men who 
             enjoy marksmanship.  It's a good group we've got.  Dad and I 
             are going down this afternoon.
     **Martin:** No, I don't think I'm going to come today, Niles.
      **Niles:** Well... it's Mitch's birthday.
     **Martin:** Well, I usually go shooting twice a year or so, and after this 
             week I've had my fill. [_the waiter brings their coffees_] Thank 
             you.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm still going.  My shooting's getting better and better.  
             Oh, plus the gun show's in town and the guys are bringing me 
             passes.
    **Frasier:** A gun show?  What's next, square dancing?
      **Niles:** Maybe. [_raises his cup_] This country was built by gun-totin' 
             square dancers.
    _Martin clinks his cup against Niles's.
    
    FADE OUT.

    Scene Six -- Woody Wiswell's Office 
    Roz, dressed professionally in a suit, is seated in front of Woody Wiswell,
    a good-looking man with a permanent friendly smile.
    _
        **Roz:** So, I really appreciate you bringing me in for this interview.  
             I've been listening to your station for a while, and I've 
             prepared a little presentation that I think will show you what 
             I can bring to the KPXY family.
      **Woody:** Oh, that's not necessary.  I mean, this is just a formality.  
             Trust me, I know what you can do.
        **Roz:** [_wary_] Really?
      **Woody:** Yeah.  I, uh, I already told the guys about you.
        **Roz:** What exactly did you tell them?
      **Woody:** Oh, you know -- how incredible you are.
        **Roz:** Okay, look, I-I think there's something that needs to be said 
             here.  Why don't we just get it all out in the open?  Yes, we 
             slept together in Cancun, but I don't want that to affect the 
             job.  I mean, it was ten years ago, I...
      **Woody:** What are you talking about?  Look, I think you have me mistaken 
             for someone else.
        **Roz:** And I think I would remember a name like Woody Wiswell.  I mean, 
             seriously, whose named Woody Wiswell?
      **Woody:** Yeah, well, just me and my dad.
    _His smile disappears as they both realize.
    
    FADE OUT.

    Scene Seven -- Gun Show
    Daphne looks on uncomfortably as Niles examines a-
    _
     **Daphne:** Darling, I just don't think you need an ankle holster when you 
             don't even own a gun.
      **Niles:** Well, first of all, who says it's for me, Miss I-Never-Surprise-
             You-Anymore?  And second of all, I'm thinking I might own a gun 
             soon.
     **Daphne:** [_firmly_] No, you won't.
      **Niles:** No, no, no, don't worry.  I, I would keep the gun in a locker 
             at the shooting range.  I would never have a gun in the same 
             house as your mother.
    _Martin comes over, looking disappointed._
     **Martin:** Now they're saying Daisy Duke might not get here.
    _Niles pats him on the shoulder.  Red, Mitch, and Wayne come over._
        **Red:** Hey, how's it going, kid?
      **Niles:** Hey, you guys, how are you?  Oh, listen, I want you to meet my 
             wife, Daphne.  Daphne, this is Red, and Wayne, and Mitch.  
             These are the guys I was telling you about.
     **Daphne:** Nice to meet you. [_they ad-lib hellos_]
        **Red:** Listen, kid, we've been talking it over, and since we get along 
             so well at the club, we'd like to invite you down to our compound 
             in Idaho for a weekend.
    _For Martin and Daphne, this immediately sets off alarm bells._
      **Niles:** [_thrilled_] A compound? [_to Martin and Daphne_] It's just like 
             the Kennedys! [_to the guys_] That sounds smashing.
        **Red:** Hey, that's the spirit.
      **Mitch:** See, I told you.  Hey, look, you're good at math, right? [_Niles
             shrugs_] Come help me guess how many shells are in that jar so I 
             can win the ATV?
      **Niles:** Oh, excuse me. [_as he follows Mitch_] What kind of TV?
    
    [_N.B. All-Terrain Vehicle -- a military transport._]
    
        **Red:** [_to Daphne_] Nice to meet you, ma'am.
     **Martin:** Oh, uh, Red, hold on a second.  Uh, just what kind of place do 
             you guys have in Idaho?
        **Red:** Run-of-the-mill compound in the wilderness -- free country where 
             we live by the true Constitution.
    _He and the guys move off with Niles._
     **Daphne:** They're those militia people!  You fix this, now.
    _Niles comes back._
      **Niles:** This is fun, huh?
     **Martin:** Uh, son...
     **Daphne:** What your father means is, you shouldn't be friends with these 
             people.
     **Martin:** Yeah, these are not your kind of guys.
      **Niles:** Why not?
     **Martin:** Well, let's just go and we'll talk about it in the car.
      **Niles:** Oh, I can't believe you two.  You're always telling me my friends 
             are too artsy and too snooty.  Now I finally have friends who are 
             regular guys, and you don't like them either?  Well, I'm having a 
             good time, and I'm enjoying being a regular guy myself.
     **Martin:** Niles, we think they want to overthrow the government!
      **Niles:** That's what you say about public television.  Now, if you'll 
             excuse me?
    _He goes over to where Red and the guys are examining a brochure._
      **Niles:** Hey, guys, whatcha doing?
        **Red:** We're chipping in for this gas-powered generator.  We're going 
             to need it when it comes time for the New World Order.
      **Niles:** Well, that sounds great, excuse me just a second.
    _He turns back to Martin and Daphne._
      **Niles:** Okay, they're militia.  
     **Martin:** Yeah.
      **Niles:** Go, go, go, go, go....
    _They make a hasty exit.
    
    FADE OUT.

    Scene Eight -- Radio Studio
    Frasier is talking to Roz in her booth.  Roz is still wearing her suit.
    _
    **Frasier:** I just don't understand how this sort of thing can happen.  
             Don't you look at faces?
        **Roz:** It was a long time ago, it was dark.  And get off my case because 
             it doesn't matter anyway - I got the job!
    **Frasier:** Oh, congratulations, Roz.  I'm so proud of you.  Now can I tell 
             you how much I'm going to miss you?
        **Roz:** Yes.
    _They hug._
        **Roz:** It is going to be sad to leave the station.  But it's not like 
             I'm leaving town, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** I know, I know.
        **Roz:** I'll see you.
    **Frasier:** See you, Roz.
        **Roz:** Bye.
    _Roz exits down the hallway.  Julia passes by the booth.  Frasier rushes
    out of the door and calls after her._
    **Frasier:** Julia!  Julia!  Julia!
    _She ignores him and enters his booth from the other door._
    **Frasier:** All right. [_crosses into his booth_] Listen, you can try to 
             avoid me all you like.  We are going to talk this thing out.
      **Julia:** Fine, fine.  Anything to get you off my back.
    _She closes the door and puts her folder down on the console._
      **Julia:** I was looking at you in the closet, and thinking how you always 
             try to do the right thing, and I felt a rush of affection for you.  
             Call me cynical, but I've come to accept that most people live by 
             the rule of screw or be screwed.  But to see you, and how much you 
             care, and really mean it, I... well, it's endearing. [_holds up a 
             finger_] Irritating, but endearing.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I... I am flattered, but there are a lot of 
             genuine people out there.  It's just that for whatever reason -- 
             fear, anger, hurt - they're afraid to show it...
    _Julia grabs him again and kisses him deeply.  He wraps his arms around 
    her.  Then they break apart._
      **Julia:** [_frustrated_] Oh, it's just like the feeling you get when you 
             see a cute teddy bear in the store and you want to hug it until 
             its head pops off!
    _By now, Frasier realizes he's on firmer ground._
    **Frasier:** Could I possibly irritate you over dinner some night?
      **Julia:** [_hesitant, but_] Well, if anybody could, it'd be you.
    **Frasier:** Take your time, work things out.  I'm not going anywhere.  
             I realize that you're in a vulnerable place right now, 
             and that...
    _She puts one arm around his neck and gives him a quick peck on the lips._
    **Frasier:** Oh, I recognize that one.  That was to shut me up.
      **Julia:** Yeah. [_starts to leave, then_] Maybe Thursday.
    _She exits the booth and walks back down the hallway.  Frasier, smiling,
    turns and gives a little smitten wave as she passes by the booth.
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    End of Act Two_
    **Credits:**
    Cafe Nervosa
    The cafe is still packed, but then the crowd notices Gertrude enter.
    She goes into the back room and puts on her apron for work.  But when
    she comes back to the counter, she sees the last of the customers 
    filing out the door and the cafe is empty.  Gertrude shrugs and starts
    to clear the tables.
