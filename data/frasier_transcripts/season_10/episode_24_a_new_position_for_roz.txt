## Transcript {Kelly Dean Hansen}

    
    
    _**Skyline:** The sun rises over the city._
    
    _ACT I_
    
    [_Scene 1 - KACL
    Frasier is discussing the state of his show with Kenny._]
    
    **Frasier:** Kenny, this is not amateur hour.  My show is already suffering
             enough just losing Roz.  I will not let you replace her with a
             complete novice.
      **Kenny:** Come on, don't you remember when you were a young whippersnapper
             with nothing but a pantload of talent and a headful of dreams?
    **Frasier:**[_pauses_] Are we still talking about Noel?
    
    [_We see that Noel is in Roz's usual place with headphones on.  Roz is
    standing behind him._]
    
       **Noel:** Five seconds to launch, Dr. Crane.
    
    [_Kenny takes the opportunity to exit.  Frasier sits at the console._]
    
    **Frasier:** Yeah. [_He puts on his headphones._] Good afternoon, Seattle, this
             is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Before we get to our first call, I'd like
             to remind you that we are losing our beloved producer, Roz Doyle
             in a couple of weeks to another career opportunity.
        **Roz:**[_jumping in, to the microphone in front of Noel_] That's KPXY, the
             Mighty Pixy, Seattle's more exciting talk, Whoo-hoo!
    **Frasier:**[_glares at Roz_] In the meantime, we have with us today Noel
             Shempsky, a KACL employee whose sole qualification for this job
             seems to be that he has never taken a sick day.
       **Noel:** Good afternoon, listeners, near and stars away.  Our first query
             comes from a Class M planet we call Earth, and appears to be
             personal in nature. [_Frasier is putting his head in his palms
             and drumming his fingers._] Oh, and his name is Glen.
    **Frasier:**[_drumming the console with his knuckles_] Go ahead, Glen, I'm
             listening.
        **Roz:**[_to Noel_] Okay, Noel, that was good, but you need to tell Frasier
             the name of the caller, the town they're calling form, and why
             they're calling.
       **Noel:** Okay.  [_rising_] You know, maybe I would learn more if you sat
             down behind me and guided my hands, like they did in _Ghost._
    
    [_Roz has taken a seat in the chair.  Noel attempts to sit on her lap,
    misses, and falls down to the floor._]
    
        **Roz:** Ooh!  Noel!! [_She recoils in disgust._]
    
    [_Julia enters Roz's booth from the outside as Noel is in this compromising
    position.  He has now turned to face Roz and is on his knees._]
    
       **Noel:** Oh, hi Julia!
        **Roz:** Do you mind?  I'm trying to show Noel what I do.
      **Julia:**[_wryly_] Is that why he's on his knees?
    
    [_Julia walks through the door to Frasier and sits next to him._]
    
        **Roz:** Get up.  Now let me give you some pointers on call screening.
             Your first priority are your leapers and jumpers.  Next up,
             angry people, they're great energy and a welcome change from
             our largest group, the sad sacks.  The trick of it is, you
             want to arrange these calls so that each segment is "can't
             miss" radio.
       **Noel:** I thought it was just about Frasier doing good work.
        **Roz:** Please, it's all about ratings!  If the station had its way,
             every call would end in an auto-erotic suicide.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Roz, now that Seattle knows how we do things around
             here, perhaps you could let Noel know to keep his elbow off the
             mic button.
    
    [_Noel quickly moves his elbow, which he has been leaning on the console.
    Julia and Frasier snicker at Roz and Noel.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment
    Frasier and Roz are seated at the dining table doing paperwork.  Martin is
    in his chair._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, do you realize this is the last time we'll do paperwork
             together?
        **Roz:**[_flatly_] Yeah, it's really sad.
     **Martin:** What exactly is the new job, Roz?
        **Roz:** Program director.
     **Martin:** Ooh, now that's a job.  Let me give you a piece of advice.  Less
             smut and more older-people shows.
        **Roz:** Yeah, I know, Martin, but that's not exactly what they're going
             for.
     **Martin:** You could have a show about owning dogs, or how about this: A
             show where people just call in with jokes they've heard.  That'd
             be a riot.
    **Frasier:** I think they're looking for a wider audience than just you, Dad.
     **Martin:** Lots of people would be interested in that sort of thing.
        **Roz:** Yeah, but the advertisers are looking for the young dollars.
     **Martin:** What's wrong with my money?
        **Roz:** You don't spend it all on fast food and beer.
     **Martin:** Yes, I do!  [_rising_] You know, I'm tired of society blowing me
             off just because I'm a senior citizen.  You know, one day we're
             going to rise and take this country back from you young smart
             alecks.  And it won't be pretty either. [_He begins to exit._]
        **Roz:** I could mention the joke idea to my boss.
     **Martin:** You just bought yourself a little more time. [_He exits._]
    **Frasier:** Well, here it is, Roz, the final parking requisition form.  The
             end of an era.  Listen, I know that Kenny is giving you a going-
             away dinner, but I wanted to have a little celebratory dinner,
             just the two of us, all right?  Any night you're free.
        **Roz:** Well, Niles and Daphne are watching Alice.  How about tonight?
    **Frasier:**[_rising_] Well, actually I'm-I'm meeting Julia later.
        **Roz:**[_rising_] Why would you want to do that?
    **Frasier:**[_walking behind the couch_] Well, we've sort of been seeing each
             other lately.
        **Roz:**[_truly shocked_] You and Julia?!  She's a total bitch.
    **Frasier:** Now, Roz, if you took the time to get to know her, you'd see that
             she's really not such a bad person.
        **Roz:** Like get to know her naked, you mean.
    **Frasier:**[_with irritation_] No.  I think she's been misjudged.  Sure, she's
             got a lot of walls up, but there must be something good inside if
             it needs that much protection.
        **Roz:** Well, there are walls around prisons, too. [_She gets ready to
             leave._]
    **Frasier:** Yes, Roz, your opinion has been noted.
        **Roz:**[_as she exits with her briefcase_] There are walls around insane
             asylums, cholera wards...
    **Frasier:**[_holding the door_] Thank you, Roz.
        **Roz:**...nuclear facilities, gator farms.
    **Frasier:** All right, shut up.
    
    [_She exits.  He closes the door.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 3 - Niles's and Daphne's apartment at the Montana
    Daphne is seated on a chair next to the fainting couch, wearing a pink
    boa and looking casual and relaxed.  Alice is chasing Niles.  She tags
    him._]
    
      **Alice:** Got you!
      **Niles:**[_playing_] Ooh!
      **Alice:** Now you chase me!
      **Niles:**[_winded_] Oh, no, I think it's Daphne's turn.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no, I just had four turns in a row.  But you know who does
             want a turn?  The TV! [_She grabs Alice and seats her in front
             of the entertainment center._]  Come on, your video's all cued up.
             [_She sighs with relief and returns to her chair._]
      **Niles:** Should we really be plopping her in front of the tube?
     **Daphne:** It's an educational tape.  Did you want to read her more _Jung
             for Jungsters?_
      **Niles:** She doesn't seem to respond to it.  Perhaps that's a treat we'll
             save for our own child.  When will that be?  When are we going to
             have a child of our own?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I don't know, when we're ready.
      **Niles:** Yes, we always say that, but how will we know when we're ready?
             I mean, if it were just me, I'm ready right now.
     **Daphne:** I just don't feel like we're quite there yet.
      **Niles:** Well, what has to change?
    
    [_At this point, Gertrude Moon walks in the front door._]
    
    **Gertrude:** What's this little brat doing here?  Make sure it don't make
              any noise. [_She exits upstairs._]
      **Daphne:** Maybe it's me biorhythms.
       **Niles:**[_laughing_] Daphne, might this have something to do with your
              mother living with us?
    
    [_As he says this, he moves from the fainting couch to the coffee table
    to face Daphne.  He sits on one of Alice's toys, which squeaks.  He and
    Daphne laugh as he removes it._]
    
      **Daphne:** Well, I've always thought in the back of my head that we'd
              start a family after she left.
       **Niles:** But that doesn't have to stop us from getting pregnant.  And
              once we are, we've got nine months to get her out of the house.
      **Daphne:** Are you kidding?  If she found out there's a grandchild on the
              way, she'd never leave.  And I don't think I could take Mum
              _and_ morning sickness at the same time.
       **Niles:**[_lovingly_] Oh the other hand, a grandmother can be a wonderful
              influence on a child.
    
    [_Gertrude re-enters from the stairway._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Alice...you help Auntie Gert find her cigarettes, and you can
              have one.
    
    [_She smiles and walks to the kitchen.  Daphne smiles knowingly at Niles,
    who chuckles.  Fade out._]
    
    **AND LEAVE ALL THIS?**
    
    [_Scene 4 - An elegant dining room.  It is Roz's going-away party.
    Kenny, Frasier, Noel, Bulldog, Gil, Julia, and others are present._]
    
      **Kenny:**[_standing and tapping a glass with a spoon_] I think now would
             be a good time if anyone wants to stand up and say a few words
             to Roz.  I know I'll miss her, which is why I'm proud to present
             her with this picture of the two of us at the last company
             picnic. [_He hands her a 4X6 snapshot._] Won't that baby look nice
             in a frame?  Enjoy.
    
    [_Kenny pats her on the shoulder and sits down.  Noel rises._]
    
       **Noel:** I'm next.
    
    [_Noel pulls out a page, which he unfolds and from which he then reads._]
    
       **Noel:** "Sweetest Roz, you are my ship when I'm at sea, my fairest rose,
             my fantasy.  With each sunrise my thanks I send, for you, my love,
             my true best friend."
    
    [_Roz seems genuinely touched by Noel's speech.  Bulldog makes faces while
    Noel is reading.  After he finishes, most attendees are polite and say
    "Nice," etc.  Bulldog reacts quite differently._]
    
    **Bulldog:** Puke!
       **Noel:** That was beautiful, you son of a b.
    **Bulldog:**[_rising_] Okay, everyb...[_Noel is in his face._] Sit down.  Sit
             down, Noel, sit down!  Okay, everybody, Bulldog to the rescue.
             Now, I don't want to say Roz has had a lot of sex, but she's
             spent more time on her back than King Tut. [_Frasier, Julia,
             Kenny, and Roz all have stunned looks on their faces._]  Did you
             hear the story about the guy at KACL who _didn't_ have sex with
             Roz?  Me neither.  But, uh, seriously--what's the difference
             between Roz and a dog in heat? [_Frasier covers his face._] No,
             really, I'm asking. [_uncomfortable pause_] You people suck!
    **Frasier:** It's not a roast, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** It's not?  I paid a guy at the Chuckle Factory 50 bucks to write
             jokes for me.
        **Gil:** When's he getting here?
    **Bulldog:** Okay, okay, you want a speech?  Best of luck in your new job,
             Roz. [_She smiles and raises her glass to him._] If you ever
             need a sports guy, I'm your man.  And I wouldn't have any problem
             with you being my boss.  After all, I know what it feels like to
             be underneath you.  Am I right?
       **Noel:**[_rising angrily to confront Bulldog_] Watch what you SAY ABOUT HER!!
    
    [_Frasier restrains Noel.  Bulldog rushes away from him._]
    
    **Frasier:** Noel!  Come on.  Walk it off, Noel, walk it off.
        **Gil:** Careful, gents!  Really, the way you two are always carrying
             on, people are going to start talking. [_He grins cheesily and
             rises._] Hello, all.  Gil Chesterton here, with a toast to Roz
             Doyle.
    **Frasier:** Hear, hear.
        **Gil:** A wonderful co-worker, and a good friend.
        **All:** Hear, hear.
        **Gil:** Of course, I too noticed Roz's sex appeal immediately.  She had
             the same effect on all of us stallions in the KACL corral.  She
             made us want to paw the ground and rise up on our powerful
             haunches [_becoming more passionate_], fetlocks glistening.  Smokey,
             Misty, Storm!  Away!
    
    [_Gil downs his entire glass.  His overwrought "heterosexuality" has made
    everybody uncomfortable._]
    
      **Kenny:** Okay, bar's closed.  Gil?
    
    [_Kenny whistles and motions for Gil to sit, which he does._]
    
      **Kenny:** Uh, Julia, your turn.
      **Julia:**[_taken a bit by surprise, but very sincerely_] Oh!  Uh, well,
             I've only known Roz a short time, but I can see that she's a
             valuable member of this team, and I'm sure you'll be missed.
             Good luck.
    
    [_This is the most sincere and respectful speech yet.  Given the source,
    all are surprised.  All raise their glasses.  Frasier rises._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well said, well said.  Roz...I celebrate your new adventure with
             you, but I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that this is a big
             loss for me.  You were there on my first day at KACL, and you
             took me under your wing.
    **Bulldog:**[_grinning_] It's crowded under there.
       **Noel:**[_menacingly whispering to Bulldog_] I will kill you!
    
    [_Bulldog moves a bit away.  Roz smiles uncomfortably._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_continuing_] I don't think I'll ever grow accustomed to seeing
             somebody else in your booth.  And certainly noone else can ever
             take your place in our hearts.  And while we welcome new friends...
             [_He places his arm on Julia's shoulder and looks at her with
             affection.  Roz has a reaction of discerinble pain when she sees
             this._]...we are sad to say good-bye to old ones.  Good luck, Roz.
        **All:** Hear, hear!  Speech!  Come on, Roz, speech!
        **Roz:**[_rising and clearing throat_] Thanks you guys. [_She sees Julia
             comfortably resting her arm on Frasier's shoulder._] I just love
             you all for doing this for me.  We really are like a family,
             aren't we?  You know, this job at KPXY is a really great, great
             opportunity.  But it'll never be like this.  Which is why I'm
             changing my mind.  I can't leave KACL, I'm staying!
      **Kenny:** Really! 
    
    [_He hugs her.  Others react similarly.  All applaud.  Frasier rises and
    gives Roz a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  Julia applauds with the rest,
    but the look on her face is uncomfortable and suspicious.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT I
    
    
    ACT II_
    
    [_Scene 5 - Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier and Roz approach the counter, where Gertrude is working._] 
    
     **Frasier:**[_into his phone_] Thank you very much. [_hanging up his phone_]
              Oh.  Mrs. Moon, we'd like to get two double lattes to go, please.
    **Gertrude:**[_smiling_] For an extra dollar, I can add a nip of brandy.
     **Frasier:** Is that on the menu?
    **Gertrude:**[_pulling a whiskey bottle from her blouse_] It's on the _secret_
              menu.
     **Frasier:** I'll pass, thank you.
         **Roz:** You know, Frasier, I feel so invigorated to get back to my old
              job.
     **Frasier:** Oh, Roz...
         **Roz:** In fact. I'd really like to record some promos tonight if
              you're available.
     **Frasier:** Oh, I can't.  I'm taking Julia to the movies.  One of my
              favorites, _Noch Einen Stuhl_.
         **Roz:**_Noch Einen Stuhl?_
     **Frasier:** Yes, it's the story of a 19th-century Austrian family as told
              from the point of view of an old fireside armchair.
         **Roz:** I'm sorry, I dozed off, what were you saying?
     **Frasier:**[_after giving her a look_] You know what, I've got to get an
              alternative newspaper to check show times.  I'll be right back.
    **Gertrude:**[_bringing their order_] Here we are.
    
    [_Frasier's cell phone, which he has left on the counter, rings._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Your phone's ringing.
         **Roz:** Oh, it's not mine, it's Frasier's.
    
    [_The phone continues to ring.  Roz checks the caller ID and drops the
    phone._]
    
         **Roz:** Ooh!  It's Julia.
    **Gertrude:** Who's that?
         **Roz:** This witch who's trying to get her hooks into Frasier.
              [_enunciating to the phone_] I hate her.
    **Gertrude:** I'll fix her.
    
    [_Gertrude answers the phone._]
    
         **Roz:** Wh-what are you doing?
    **Gertrude:**[_waving Roz off, talking to the phone in a "seductive" voice_]
              Hello.  [_pause_] Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier's in no position to talk,
              if you, uh, get my meaning.  Who's this, then?  Hold on. [_She
              holds the phone at a short distance._] Sweetheart?  Do you want
              to talk to a Julia? [_giggling girlishly_] Oh!  Frasier, put me
              down! [_normal voice_] Sorry, he's not here after all.  Bye, now.
              [_She hangs up quickly._]  There.  Problem solved.
         **Roz:** You know, you probably ruined their entire evening.  How can
              I thank you?
    
    [_Frasier returns, grabbing his phone._]
    
     **Frasier:** Only one showing of _Noch Einen Stuhl_ tonight.  Got to go by the
              box office and pick up the tickets.
         **Roz:**[_sarcastically_] Yes, I bet they're going fast.
    
    [_They head to the exit, and run into Niles and Daphne, who are coming in._]
    
      **Daphne:** Hello!
     **Frasier:** Oh, sorry!  Wish we could join you guys.  I'm going to get
              tickets for _Noch Einen Stuhl!_
       **Niles:**[_checking his watch_] Cutting it a little close, aren't you?
    
    [_Frasier and Roz exit.  Niles and Daphne approach a table._]
    
      **Daphne:** Hey, Mum!  Whan you finish your shift, we'll drive you home.
    **Gertrude:** Really?  Are you sure it wouldn't give you more pleasure to
              see me walk home on my bloody stumps?
      **Daphne:** Well, it would, but we're in a hurry.
       **Niles:** We'll, uh, we'll be here when you're ready.
    
    [_They observe a mother with an infant in a carrier._]
    
      **Daphne:** Oh, Niles...
       **Niles:** Oh...
      **Daphne:** Just think, one day we'll have one of those.
       **Niles:** Yes, just one awkward chore to get out of the way.
      **Daphne:** Well, that's romantic.
       **Niles:** I meant asking your mother to move out.
      **Daphne:** We're not asking her, Niles, we're telling her!
       **Niles:** I know, I know.
      **Daphne:** You have to be firm.
       **Niles:** Yes.
      **Daphne:** This is a woman who came for a week and stayed for a year and
              a half.
       **Niles:** Yes, I know, I just think that--
      **Daphne:** It's not like she's got no place to go.  She's got seven other
              children!
       **Niles:** I know.
      **Daphne:** Plus a home and friends in England.
       **Niles:** Many friends, yes, I just, I...I just don't know how to break
              it to her.
      **Daphne:** Well, the sooner we do, the sooner we can start our own family.
       **Niles:** You're right.  Do you realize, this time next year we could be
              sitting here with our own baby?
    **Gertrude:**[_overhearing as she walks by_] Baby?  What's this, then?
      **Daphne:** We'll talk about it later.
    **Gertrude:** I want to talk about it now.  What's going on?
      **Daphne:** Well, I was going to wait until later, but if you really want
              to know, we--
       **Niles:** Wait, wait, Daphne, Daphne. [_clears throat_] We've decided to
              start trying to get pregnant.
    **Gertrude:** Oh, well, I'm glad you think you can.  I was beginning to think
              there might be something wrong with your equipment, Niles.
       **Niles:**[_this is the motivation he needs_] Oh, were you?  Well, here's
              more news: you're out of the house, so go pack your bags and
              find another sucker.
    
    [_Gertrude reacts.  Julia has entered and stands behind her._]
    
       **Julia:** Excuse me.  Can I get some service over here?
    **Gertrude:** Keep your knickers on.  Don't move.  We're not done hashing
              this through.
    
    [_She goes behind the counter and changes her attitude to take Julia's
    order._]
    
    **Gertrude:**[_in the "singsong" voice she used to answer Frasier's phone_]
              Hello!
       **Julia:**[_recognizing the voice, and suspiciously imitating it_] Hello!
    **Gertrude:**[_again singsong_] Hello!
       **Julia:** Say that again.
    **Gertrude:**[_singsong_] Hello?
       **Julia:** Now say, "Frasier's in no position to talk, if you get my
              meaning."
    **Gertrude:**[_immediately giving in_] Now, it was all Roz's idea.  I had no
              choice.  I'm not a well woman.
    
    [_She exits to the back.  Julia reacts.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 6 - KACL
    Julia enters the studio and confronts her._]
    
      **Julia:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Julia.
      **Julia:**[_closing the door_] I just talked to that waitress over at Nervosa.
             The one that answered Frasier's phone?  She gave you up immediately.
        **Roz:**[_forcing laughter_] Relax?  It was just a joke.
      **Julia:** Okay.  So what's going on?  Do you have some sort of problem with
             me seeing Frasier?
        **Roz:** Well, as long as you're asking...I think you're all wrong for him.
      **Julia:** That's not your call.
        **Roz:** I think I know Frasier a little better than you.
    
    [_Roz walks back to her booth.  Julia, clearly deeply offended and hurt,
    but remaining calm, follows her._]
    
      **Julia:** So?
        **Roz:** So...he deserves someone better.  Someone who'll appreciate him.
      **Julia:**[_barely keeping her cool_] Oh, really?
        **Roz:** Yeah.  Frasier's a good guy.  He's smart and sweet and way too
             good for you.  Why don't you just leave?  Nobody here likes you
             anyway.
      **Julia:**[_stoically_] Frasier seems to.
        **Roz:** Well, he's an idiot.
      **Julia:** Are you trying to save Frasier from me or are you trying to save
             him for yourself?
        **Roz:** Are you out of your mind?
      **Julia:**[_genuinely_] Are you in love with him?
        **Roz:** Go to hell, Julia!
      **Julia:** That would explain why you turned down that great job.
        **Roz:**[_faltering_] That is not true.
    
    [_At this point, Noel, Gil, Kenny, and Bulldog have all gathered at the
    window and begun to observe the confrontation._]
    
      **Julia:** Then stay out of my way.
        **Roz:** Or what?
      **Julia:** Do you want to find out?
        **Roz:** What, are you going to hit me or something?
      **Julia:** Don't think I won't.
        **Roz:** Well, you're sure taking your time.
    
    [_Others have joined the foursome at the window.  Julia and Roz both
    shoot them an angry glance, and they quickly turn away their faces._]
    
        **Roz:** Stay away from him?  Got it?
    
    [_Julia retains her calm but cool composure.  Roz exits the booth and
    chases away the voyeurs._]
    
        **Roz:** Get out of here!
    
    [_They quickly disperse.  Julia remains standing in the booth, contemplating
    what has just transpired.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 7 - Niles and Daphne's apartment
    Gertrude is standing in the doorway, nicely dressed and surrounded by
    her luggage._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Well, I guess this is goodbye.  Um, I just want you to know,
              I love you both very much, and I'm, you know, looking forward
              to standing on my own two feet again.
    
    [_Niles and Daphne nod without emotion._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Uh, thank you for the ticket and the luggage and the clothes
              and the spending money. [_gasping_] I'm sorry.  This is just so
              sad.
       **Niles:**[_caving_] Gertrude, are you sure you're okay...
      **Daphne:**[_interrupting, bluntly and without emotion_] Good-bye, Mum,
              have a nice trip.  Say hello to everyone in Manchester for me.
    **Gertrude:** Right, then. [_She kisses Daphne on the cheek._] Good-bye, Niles.
              [_She embraces him._] I know you'll be a wonderful father to my
              grandchild.  I hope you'll find time to send me a picture.
       **Niles:**[_caving again_] Can't we all just talk--
      **Daphne:**[_interrupting_] We have your address.
    **Gertrude:** I'm off. [_She exits.  Her whole demeanor has changed in this
              exchange.  She has been less abrasive and more sincere._]
       **Niles:**[_barely containing himself_] Bye.
    
    [_Daphne closes the door._]
    
       **Niles:** Oh, Daphne, you were wonderful.  I don't know how you did it.
    
    [_Daphne suddenly breaks down in a fit of uncontrollable sobs._]
    
      **Daphne:** Hold me, Niles.
    
    [_They embrace.  She continues to weep._]
    
       **Niles:** Hang on, hang on. [_yelling_] Gertrude!
    
    [_He opens the door.  She is standing right there, sobbing uncontrollably._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Yes?
       **Niles:** Come here, come here.
    
    [_She enters the apartment._]
    
       **Niles:** Would you be willing to stay in Seattle if, say, you had your
              own apartment?
      **Daphne:**[_breathlessly_] Oh, Niles!
    **Gertrude:** Do you really mean that?  I mean, I don't want to intrude.
       **Niles:** Well, of course I mean it.  And-and-and we'd even help with
              the rent.
    **Gertrude:**[_beginning to return to her old self_] Define "help."
       **Niles:** We'll talk.
    **Gertrude:** Well, then, it's settled.  I'll just go tell the taxi I'm
              not going!
       **Niles:** No, no, no.  You're going.  Just tell them to take you to the
              Four Seasons.  I'll go ahead and call and book you a room.
    **Gertrude:** You've made me so happy, I think I'm going to cry!
    
    [_She embraces Niles.  He laughs nervously.  Daphne smiles lovingly._]
    
    **Gertrude:** Niles, I...I don't know how to thank you.
    
    [_She exits.  Niles closes the door._]
    
      **Daphne:**[_warmly_] I do.
    
    [_She leads Niles away by the hand.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 8 - Frasier's apartment
    Martin answers the door to Roz._]
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Martin.
     **Martin:** Hi, Roz.  Come in.
        **Roz:** Is Frasier here?  I really need to talk to him.
     **Martin:** No, he went out for dinner.
        **Roz:** Oh, let me guess: Julia.
     **Martin:**[_a bit shocked_] Wow!  Not a fan, huh?
        **Roz:** I can't stand her actually.
     **Martin:** Really? [_chuckling_] Well, I just met her this evening, but she
             seemed nice to me.
    
    [_Martin moves to sit in his chair._]
    
        **Roz:**[_sitting on the coffee table_] Well, that's because she's got you
             snowed.  She's a mean, snooty tight-ass who thinks she's better
             than everybody else, and Frasier's making a giant mistake and
             somebody's got to do something about it.
     **Martin:** Well, good luck, when Frasier's heart takes over his brain shuts
             out.
        **Roz:** That's why we have to do something now, before this _relationship_
             gets any closer.  Will you help me?
     **Martin:**[_tentatively_] Well, Roz, if you feel that strongly about it, sure,
             I'll back you up.
    
    [_Frasier and Julia enter.  Julia is carrying a cake box._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi guys!
     **Martin:** Hey!
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz!
      **Julia:** Hello, Roz.  Nice to see you.
        **Roz:** Julia.
      **Julia:**[_enthusiastically_] Martin, I've brought you some cake from the
             restaurant.
     **Martin:** Restaurant cake? [_He begins to get up._]
        **Roz:** Steady...
      **Julia:**[_from the kitchen entry_] It's chocolate.  Why don't I cut you a
             slice and pour you some milk?
     **Martin:**[_standing, to Roz_] New plan.  I'll distract her while you talk
             to Frasier.
    
    [_Martin follows Julia into the kitchen.  Frasier returns from the coat
    racks._]
    
    **Frasier:** What's going on, Roz? I didn't expect to see you tonight.
        **Roz:** Well, um, I have something really important to talk to you
             about, and I really need you to listen to me.
    **Frasier:** Well, absolutely, that's what I do.
    
    [_Frasier sits on the arm of Martin's chair, Roz on the coffee table._]
    
        **Roz:** I really, really, really think you should stop seeing Julia.
    **Frasier:** Look, I know you two have your difficulties.
        **Roz:**[_cutting him off_] No!  It's not that.  She's all wrong for you.
    **Frasier:**[_after a pause_] I think I see what's going on here.  You and I
             have a close relationship.  A new woman comes to the radio
             station.  She and I form a close relationship, and you feel
             threatened.
        **Roz:** No.  She's evil. [_Frasier is taken aback._] It's not your fault.
             You can't see it because she puts on an act around you.
    **Frasier:** Did it ever occur to you that maybe she's putting on an act for
             everybody else, and that maybe _I_ see her as she really is?
        **Roz:** Oh, she's got you totally brainwashed.
    **Frasier:** Roz, you have no right to come over here and run her down to me.
             It's really none of your business.
        **Roz:** This _is_ my business!
    **Frasier:** And why?
        **Roz:** Because...we're friends. [_She suddenly becomes quite passionate._]
             I can't believe you're turning on me like this!  I gave up a job
             that was ten times better to stay on your show!
    **Frasier:** Yes, and frankly, I don't understand that!  Why exactly did you
             turn down that job?
    
    [_They both rise._]
    
        **Roz:** Out of loyalty to you!
    **Frasier:** Loyalty to me?  Are you sure?  Are you sure it wasn't just fear?
             Are you sure you're not just using me as an excuse not to grow
             and move on?
    
    [_Julia enters from the kitchen._]
    
      **Julia:**[_cheerily_] Who wants restaurant cake?
    
    [_Frasier turns to her uncomfotably._]
    
        **Roz:** You're going to have to choose, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**[_angrily_] You will _not_ put me in this position, Roz.  We will
             discuss it later!
        **Roz:**[_shouting_] No!  Tell me!  [_pointing_] It's _her_ or me!  Tell me
             now, or I swear to God I will walk out of here and I will not
             come back!
    
    [_Frasier is clearly angered and offended that Roz has presented him with
    such a choice.  He glares at her and walks to Julia's side._]
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Julia, I think I will have some cake.
    
    [_Again he glares at Roz._]
    
        **Roz:**[_stunned, weakly_] Fine.
    
    [_She picks up her purse and exits dramatically.  Julia faces Frasier
    and comforts him with what seems to be real affection.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 9 - KPXY studio
    The station manager, Woody Wizwell, is showing Roz her office._]
    
    **Wiswell:** And this will be your office, Ms. Doyle.  Make yourself at home.
        **Roz:** Thank you, Mr. Wiswell.
    **Wiswell:** Uh, there's no chance you'll change your mind again, is there?
    
    [_Roz is setting up at her desk._]
    
        **Roz:** No.  KACL is ancient history.
    **Wiswell:** Good.
    
    [_He exits.  Roz continues to set up her desk, but she is clearly deeply
    troubled.  Fade out._]
    
    **Credits**
    THANKS FOR CALLING!
    The faces of some of this season's guest callers are shown: Billy Bean,
    Charles Busch, Laura Linney, Bill Paxton, and Bradley Whitford.
    
    NB: The "Thanks for Calling" credits have been used for seasons 2, 3, 4,
    6, 9, and 10.  Season 7 ended with a major cliffhanger, and the device
    would have been appropriate, but due to a lack of guest callers that
    season, NBC ran a promo after the one-hour finale both in its first-run
    and rerun appearances.  In syndication, the credits for "Something
    Borrowed, Someone Blue" run over a shot of Frasier's empty apartment.
    Season Five was another cliffhanger, but the finale of "Sweet Dreams"
    famously presents "Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs" in Spanish and a
    salsa style while Frasier cleans out his office at the station.  This
    is the only time that the theme has not been sung by Kelsey Grammer.
    Season Eight also had a cliffhanger, but again, a dearth of guest
    callers.  The credit sequence for that finale, "Cranes Go Caribbean,"
    referred to a Niles/Daphne subplot.  Season One had the waitress again
    fixing Frasier's coffee after "My Coffee With Niles."  "Thanks for Calling"
    seemed to become standard after season two, then disappear for a couple
    of seasons, but now it has been re-established.  The season finales of
    1, 2, 3, and 6 could be classified as "closure" rather than "cliffhanger"
    types of episodes.  Season Four was the first time a cliffhanger was used,
    with Frasier spontaneously boarding a plane.  Now aren't you glad I gave
    you that convenient (or possibly useless) little season finale compendium? :)
