## Transcript {Kelly Dean Hansen}

    
    
    _**Skyline:** A helicopter rises above the buildings._
    
    _ACT 1_
    
    [_Scene 1 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin and Daphne are sitting at the table._]
    
     **Martin:** A hell of a breakfast, Daph.  I'm stuffed.
     **Daphne:** Thanks.  Now come on, let's do some exercises.
     **Martin:** And risk a cramp?  What kind of training did you get?
    
    [_Frasier enters_]
    
    **Frasier:** Good morning. [_He sits._]
     **Martin:** Hi, Fras.
     **Daphne:** Morning.
     **Martin:** Want some breakfast?
    **Frasier:** Um, no thanks.  Coffee will be fine.  Hi, Daph, uh, listen.  I
             could use an objective opinion.  I am running for condo board
             president, and I want to know what you think of this as a
             slogan: "Frasier Crane--The People's Elixir." [_He beams._]
     **Martin:** OK, I'm ready for my exercises now.
    **Frasier:** Please, Dad, this is serious!  I have a feeling this could be
             my year.
     **Daphne:** Don't you say that every year.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I do, but this year, I am the only one running against the
             incumbent, which means the people will rally their inchoate 
             yearnings for change behind my banner.
     **Martin:** Well, you're full of catchy slogans.  Frasier, don't get your
             hopes up too high, I mean, name one person on the condo board
             you haven't ticked off at least once.
    **Frasier:** That's just because I have a Type-A, hands-on, get-it-done
             personality.
     **Martin:** Seriously, name one.  You know, Fras, you might be the best
             man for the job, but a friendly smile and a "How do you do" in
             the hallway goes a lot further than being "The People's Laxative."
    **Frasier:**[_indignantly_] _Elixir!_  Well, I suppose you're right.  I 
             haven't really established myself as the neighborly sort.  I 
             thought that my term as fire safety captain might do the trick,
             but...I guess I drilled them once too often.
     **Daphne:**[_to Martin_] Maybe you could give him lessons on how to be a 
             normal person.
    **Frasier:** I beg your pardon?  Say, I've got an idea.  Dad, why don't you
             just run?
     **Martin:** Why would I want to do that?
    **Frasier:** Well, because then the people would get their regular guy, but
             he would have my political agenda.
     **Daphne:** I get it.  Your father's the figurehead.  Like Woodrow Wilson 
             when he had that stroke and his wife secretly acted as president.
    **Frasier:** Yes, exactly, but of course Dad would be conscious, presumably.
     **Martin:** How did you know about that?
     **Daphne:** I'm studying for my citizenship exam.  It's about time I became
             am American like everyone else. [_She goes to the kitchen._]
    **Frasier:** If you were like everyone else, you wouldn't know any history.
             So, Dad, what do you think?
     **Martin:** I don't know, it sounds like a big pain.
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, Dad.  Think of the neighbors.  Think of the building,
             the good we could do together.  We can actually achieve the dream
             of luxury apartment living that our founders intended.  Plus,
             I'll do all the work.
     **Martin:** I'll tell you something I always thought we needed: wider parking
             spaces so the doors don't get dinged.
    **Frasier:** All right, you do this for me, I'll make sure that gets done.
     **Martin:** Really?
    **Frasier:** Absolutely...Mr. President!
     **Martin:** I like the sound of that. [_They laugh._]
    **Frasier:** Now I think I should still run against you. [_He rises to exit._]
     **Martin:** Why?
    **Frasier:**[_walking to the door_] Well, if I drop out just as you announce
             your candidacy, people might suspect something's up.  It's 
             better that our political legerdemain remain sub rosa, hmm?
             How would a normal person say that, Dad?
     **Martin:** No one needs to know how the hot dogs are made.
    **Frasier:** This is going to be sweet.
    
    [_He exits.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 2 - Condo Board Conference Room
    Frasier is addressing the board._]
    
    **Frasier:** Which brings me to my final opponent.  Martin Crane.  Now we're
             all aware that he is a decorated war hero and a much-honored
             police officer, but does he have the building's interests at
             heart? [_hamming_] Maybe.  I simply ask that you stack up his
             45 years of experience against my term as fire safety captain.
             Thank you.  And God bless Elliot Bay Towers.
    
    [_There is very light applause.  Paul, a presiding board member, rises._]
    
       **Paul:** And now we'll hear from Martin Crane.
    
    [_The applause for Martin is much louder than it was for Frasier._]
    
     **Martin:** Uh, thanks, uh, I'm Marty Crane, uh I just want to say that
             it's a privilege to run and, uh, I'll try to do the best I
             can.  Go Seahawks!
    
    [_More loud applause follows.  Frasier hams his enthusiastic applause._]
    
       **Paul:** Um, here's where we hear from our third candidate, current
             president Jim McIntyre, but uh, last night he informed me that
             he was giving up condo board in order to pursue his dream of
             teaching English as a second language.
    **Frasier:**[_to Martin_] Dream? Or court-ordered community service?
       **Paul:** So, I guess it's time to vote.
     **Martin:** Well, I wish we would have known that guy wasn't going to run.
             I wouldn't have had to spend all night working on my speech.
    **Frasier:** Yes, plus, I would automatically be president now.
     **Martin:** Yeah, even you couldn't lose a one-man election.
    **Frasier:** Hmm, are you forgetting 1998?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, when you lost to the dead guy.
    **Frasier:** He wasn't dead he was in a coma.  How was I supposed to
             compete with that?
       **Paul:** OK, ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.  In a surprisingly
             close vote of fifteen to two, our new president is Martin Crane.
    **Frasier:** Yes!  I got two votes!
    
    [_Martin chuckles, somewhat embarassed.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 3 - The Montana apartment.
    Daphne is showing a woman out of the door.  She and Niles are both
    wearing bathrobes.  Niles is relaxed on a chair._]
    
     **Daphne:** Bye-bye.  Uh, what a great massage.  It's too bad her English
             wasn't better.  She could have told us some of her secrets.
             [_She sits next to him and takes his hand._]
      **Niles:** Yes, but now we know that Urdu is the official language of
             heaven.  I could go for a snack.  Want some p�te?
     **Daphne:** No thanks.
      **Niles:** Some cheese?
     **Daphne:** No.
      **Niles:** P�te?
     **Daphne:** Again, no.  How about some salad?
      **Niles:** Or a fruit salad.  I could throw together a little melange.
    
    [_The doorbell rings._]
    
     **Daphne:** I'll get it.  A melange sounds lovely. [_She answers.  It is
             Roz._] Roz, I thought you were going out with that man from your
             gym.
        **Roz:** We didn't even make it to dinner.  Here's your never-fail date
             purse back.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry. No, come on in.
        **Roz:** Are you sure?  You look like you're going to bed.
     **Daphne:** No, we just got a massage.  Come in.
        **Roz:**[_imitating Daphne's pronounciation of the word_] Oh.  Boy a
             _massage_ sounds wonderful.
     **Daphne:** She did the most incredible thing to my neck.  Here, let me
             show you.
    
    [_Roz sits.  Daphne massages her neck._]
    
        **Roz:** Hmm. Oh, Mmm-hmm.
     **Daphne:** So how could you tell your date wasn't meant to be?
        **Roz:** He had the same purse.  Wow, that feels so good!
     **Daphne:** Mmm-hmm.
    
    [_Niles enters from the kitchen._]
    
      **Niles:** Oh, hi Roz!
        **Roz:** Hi!
     **Daphne:** Poor thing had a bad date.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, now that Daphne's helping you to relax,
             do you want to join us in a little melange?
    
    [_Roz suddenly stiffens and has a very troubled, shocked look on her
    face. Daphne continues to massage her shoulders, and there is a pause._]
    
        **Roz:**[_weakly_] What?
     **Daphne:** You'll love it.  Niles is amazing.
        **Roz:** Wait, what are you saying?
     **Daphne:** Unless you have other plans.
        **Roz:** Well, I guess not, but...
      **Niles:**[_handing her the fruit salad_] Than here you go.
        **Roz:**[_relieved_] Oh.  Fruit salad.  Oh my God, I thought you said
             menage!
    
    [_They all laugh hysterically.  Roz eats the salad.  Daphne stops the
    massage and sits._]
    
      **Niles:** Well, the fruits do mix a little promiscuously.
        **Roz:** I was thinking, "Oh my God, what are they saying?"
      **Niles:** Rest assured, we would have offered you something more than
             fruit salad to get you in the mood. [_They continue to laugh._]
     **Daphne:** You know what?  She didn't say no.
      **Niles:** You're right, she didn't.
        **Roz:** It was only because it was so weird, I didn't know what to say.
     **Daphne:** Is that why?
      **Niles:** I think someone has a little crush on us.
        **Roz:** You wish.
     **Daphne:** We know what you wish. [_Niles laughs._]
        **Roz:** Okay, Okay.  Let's talk about something else.  What are you
             guys going to do this weekend?
      **Niles:**[_sitting next to Daphne_] You, if you get your way. [_Niles and
             Daphne continue to guffaw.  Roz becomes visibly irritated._]
     **Daphne:** So, if we had have asked you, you would have said no?
        **Roz:** Of course I would have.
      **Niles:** I see, and what's wrong with us?
     **Daphne:** Do you find us unattractive?
      **Niles:** Well, what if we wore masks?
     **Daphne:** Oh, they'd have to be Nixon and Frakenstein.  That's all
             we've got.
        **Roz:** All right, you guys!  Stop it!  I'm sorry I didn't understand
             your little code word for fruit salad.
     **Daphne:** We're sorry.  Here you haven't even had dinner and we're
             teasing you.
      **Niles:** Oh, you haven't?  I didn't know that.  Let me make you
             something.
        **Roz:** No, it's OK, I'm not that hungry.
     **Daphne:** Oh, come on.
        **Roz:** Oh, all right.  I wouldn't say no to a sandwich.
    
    [_This is too much for Niles and Daphne.  They cannot resist and begin
    to giggle again.  Roz, unamused, rises indignantly to leave.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 4 - Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier is speaking on the phone.  Martin is in his usual position._]
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, he is doing a hell of a job, isn't he?  Oh, listen, what
             did you think of the new plants in the lobby?  Dad was
             particularly pleased with how they complimented the filigree
             in the sconces.
     **Martin:** Don't tell people that!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I suppose the best man did win.  Bye-bye.  Another
             satisfied constituent.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastically_] Well, whoop-de-do.
    
    [_The doorbell rings.  Frasier answers.  It is Paul._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello.
       **Paul:** Hi, Frasier.  Hey, Marty [_He rushes to Martin in admiration._]
     **Martin:** Hey, Paul.
       **Paul:** I just came down to congratulate you.  Every president talks 
             about getting new dryers, but you finally did something
             about it.
    **Frasier:** You see, Dad.  They love what you're doing for the building!
             Of course, the sting of losing was quite painful.  But it's 
             worth it, if we can have a laundry room that takes us into
             the 21st Century.
       **Paul:** You're being a good sport about this, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, public-spiritedness is the Crane code.
     **Martin:** Right on! Uh, Paul, could you, uh...[_He gestures for Paul to
             step out of his line of vision to the television._]
       **Paul:** Oh, sure.  Uh, hey, is it OK if I move the recycling bins down
             to the landing at the bottom of the stairs?
     **Martin:** Knock yourself out.
       **Paul:** Great, thanks. [_He exits._]
    
    [_Frasier has a sudden indignant look.  He glares at Martin._]
    
    **Frasier:** Is this going to be a problem?
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** I think we need to reach a little understanding.  If someone
             asks you a question, you look at me.  If I scratch my nose [_he
             demonstrates_], it means "No."  You get it?  They both begin
             with the same two letters: "N-O." [_Martin rolls his eye in
             disgust._] Now if I touch my eye [_again demonstrating_], it
             means "aye," as in "yes."
     **Martin:** Guess what you're being if I touch my ass.
    **Frasier:** Dad?
     **Martin:** I think I can at least take care of the no-brainer decisions
             myself.
    **Frasier:** That is not how this is supposed to work.
     **Martin:** Well, I thought how this was supposed to work was that if I
             agreed to do this, you would do the one thing I asked for.
    **Frasier:** Yes, wider parking spaces, but I have five years of ideas here
             to implement first!
    
    [_He sits, demonstrating the papers and files he has laid out on the
    coffee table._]
    
     **Martin:** Five years?  By the time I get my parking space I'll be driving
             a three-wheeled scooter with an oxygen tank on the back!
    **Frasier:** Look, even if I could fast-track it, there are feasability 
             studies to be done.  There's, um, a committee review, and then
             there's a bidding process.  You can't just hire some guy with
             a can of paint.
     **Martin:** Well, that's what I'd do.
    **Frasier:** Well that is why you're not in charge. [_Martin is taken aback
             at this._] Now, here's your agenda for the next meeting.  Make
             sure you follow it to the letter!
     **Martin:** Yes, master. [_He rises and heads to the kitchen._]
    **Frasier:** Dad, I sense you're chafing under the cruel yoke of public
             service.  Remember, we must subordinate our own wishes for
             the good of the building! [_Martin is out of view. Kelsey now
             does one of his famous Bette Davis takes._] And that is not one
             of our hand signals!
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 5 - Conference Room.
    Martin is sitting at the head table, presiding._]
    
     **Martin:** Next item, a study to determine the feasability of putting...
             something on the roof. Any volunteers?
    **Frasier:** I volunteer.  And I would like to explore the idea of putting
             a patio on the roof.
     **Martin:** All right, well, that about wraps things up.
    **Frasier:** Uh, query?
     **Martin:**[_wearily_] Recognized.
    **Frasier:** Wasn't there, uh, something else you wanted to bring up?
     **Martin:**[_looking at the agenda_] Nope.  Don't think so.
    **Frasier:** Are you sure?  I-I could have sworn I heard the president say
             something about a-a new ventilation system.
     **Martin:** Oh, we've done enough for tonight.
    **Frasier:**[_suddenly short and angry_] No, you haven't! [_Everybody,
             including Martin, is taken aback.  Frasier recovers._] I'm
             certain if you simply consult the agenda which you so
             painstakingly prepared, you will find that there is one
             last item.
     **Martin:**[_consulting the agenda_] Oh, yeah!  Here it is! Wider parking
             spaces
    
    [_Various calls of "Oh, that's good!" "Real good."_]
    
       **Paul:** Great idea, classic Marty!
    **Frasier:**[_in a warning tone_] Are you sure it's not a ventilation system?
     **Martin:** No.  Wider...spaces.  Those in favor of better parking?
             [_Everyone responds "aye."_] Those opposed to better parking?
    **Frasier:** Nay!
     **Martin:** Motion carries!
    **Frasier:** Query!
     **Martin:** Not recognized.
    
    [_Frasier looks up in supreme indignation._]
    
       **Paul:** Marty, I'm afraid I have to interrupt.  There's a delivery
             for you.  Bring it in Mrs. Richman.
    
    [_Mrs. Richman enters, pushing a cart with a cake.  This character's 
    most famous appearance was in the elevator scene of Episode_[[7.23],](/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_23/something_borrowed_someone_blue_1.html)_"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue [_I_]."_]
    
    **Richman:** Here we go.
     **Martin:** Whoa!  A cake!  What's the occasion?
       **Paul:** We wanted to show you our appreciation for all the great things
             you've done for us.
     **Martin:**[_beaming_] Wow! I never thought I'd see myself in frosting!
       **Paul:** In the last couple of weeks, you've done more for this building
             than the last two presidents combined. Where did you get all
             these great ideas?
     **Martin:**[_smiling, but staring pointedly at Frasier_] Oh, I don't know.
             They just come to me while I'm trying to watch TV.  Why don't
             you make yourself useful and cut the cake, Fras?
    **Frasier:**[_with venom_] My pleasure, _Mr. President._
    
    [_He grabs the knife with an evil expression, and maliciously slices
    the cake across the point of Martin's throat in the frosting photo.
    Martin gets the hint and smiles back at Frasier.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT I
    
    
    ACT II_
    
    [_Scene 6 - Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier is seated at the table with papers, working.  Martin enters._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_coldly_] Hello.
     **Martin:** Oh, don't be sore.  I'll get to the ventilation system
             eventually.
    **Frasier:** You went back on our agreement.  I'm the one who's supposed
             to call the shots around here.
     **Martin:** Our agreement was that we'd get wider parking spaces, but 
             you blew me off.  As far as I'm concerned the agreement is
             over. [_He sits at the table with some food._] Besides, I think
             I have a knack for this president thing.  Now, I'd like to
             keep you on my team, but, uh, if it's too rough for you, just
             say the word. [_He looks at some papers._]
    **Frasier:** Well, well, well.  The puppet thinks he's a real boy. [_Martin
             smiles._] I don't think you have the skills for this job.
     **Martin:** I have something better--people skills.
    **Frasier:**[_angrily_] So do I, but these boobs and nincompoops are too
             stupid to see it!
     **Martin:** Well, if you're so sure you're indispensable, maybe you should
             run for president.  Oh, wait.  You did, five times.
    **Frasier:** They wouldn't love you so much if it weren't for my ideas!
     **Martin:** Right, because you need a Ph. D. to think about repainting the
             lobby.  Oh, wait.  You don't.
    **Frasier:** Would you stop doing that?
     **Martin:** You're right.  It's not an effective way to argue.  Oh, wait.
             It is.
    
    [_Frasier begins to seethe in his chair.  Fade Out._]

     **Daphne:**[_over fade-in_] Don't you just love this part of American history?
      **Niles:** I'm not much of a Civil War buff.
     **Daphne:** It's fascinating.  Much more so than the English Civil War.
      **Niles:**[_playfully affronted_] Impossible!  Didn't you want to be there
             when Charles I unfurled his standard at Nottingham in 1642?
     **Daphne:** Ugh.  You sound like school.
      **Niles:** Well, we'll let Frasier settle it.  Which Civil War was more
             interesting?
    **Frasier:**[_approaching from the counter_] Spanish.  But I don't have
             time to prove it.  I've got to go confront Evita Per�n at the
             condo board meeting tonight.
      **Niles:** Dad?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** I thought he was doing a good job.
    **Frasier:** Well, he was, until he started to think for himself.  He's so
             damn popular everybody else just follows along.  It's like the
             blind leading the blind.
      **Niles:** Well...
    **Frasier:** But it will not stand!  As soon as he calls for new business 
             tonight, I am going to leap to my feet and expose him for the
             power-mad dictator that he's become. [_He hurriedly drinks his
             coffee._]  Mm-mmm.  Then I'll take over. [_He rises to leave in
             a rush._]
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane!  Maybe you should take it easy on your father.
    **Frasier:** Why?!
     **Daphne:** Because he's getting out more, having fun with other people in
             the building.  You can't take that away from him.
      **Niles:** You get to be a big shot all the time.  This is Dad's turn in
             the limelight.  It's good for his self-esteem.
    **Frasier:** Why do I even talk to you people?
    
    [_He exits in a rush, passing Roz, who is entering._]
    
        **Roz:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Not now!
        **Roz:** Okay! [_To Niles and Daphne_] Hi, can I join you guys?
      **Niles:** Oh.
     **Daphne:** I think someone is coming on to us.
      **Niles:** Someone just can't leave us alone. [_They giggle._]
        **Roz:** Okay, you guys have been doing this for over two weeks.  Lay
             off.
      **Niles:** I thought "laying off" was exactly what you didn't want us
             to do!
     **Daphne:**[_cracking up_] That's a good one.
        **Roz:** It doesn't even make sense. [_During this speech, her voice
             gradually increases in volume and the entire cafe becomes
             quiet as she finishes._] Listen, I don't want to have a 
             threesome with you.  I never wanted to have a threesome with
             you, and I will not have a threesome with you!  So quit
             bringing it up!
    
    [_She leaves in a huff.  All are staring at Daphne and Niles._]
    
     **Daphne:** I think we went a little too far.
      **Niles:** Not as far as she wanted to go. [_They again begin to laugh
             hysterically.  A bearded man in a leather jacket approaches
             them._]
    **Swinger:** Excuse me.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    **Swinger:** I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing, and as a fellow
             non-traditional sex enthusiast, our day will come.  Here's
             my card.
      **Niles:**[_taking the card between two fingers, as if it were toxic_]
             Thank you.
    **Swinger:**[_as he exits_] Oh, and by the way, a bunch of us get together
             over at the SeaTac Hyatt second Saturday of every month.  And
             if you want to just tape your wife with another dude, that's 
             cool. [_He exits._]
    
    [_Niles and Daphne shudder in disgust.  Niles, holding the card as he
    would a dirty diaper, quickly drops it on the table, whereupon he
    immediately grabs a wet wipe and cleans his fingers.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 8 - Conference Room.
    Frasier enters, late.  Martin, Paul, and Mrs. Richman are at the head
    table._]
    
     **Martin:** Thank you, Mrs. Richman, and for anyone who needs reminding,
             these meetings start at 8:00, not 8:07. [_He looks at his watch._]
    **Frasier:** Noted.
     **Martin:** Well, shall we open the floor up to new business?
    **Frasier:**[_quickly rising_] Yes! Yes! Yes!  It's time you people understood
             the real kind of pres...
    
    [_He is interrupted by a tenant, Albert.  This character has appeared
    before, most notably in Niles's version of Episode_[[5.09],](/frasier/transcripts/season_5/episode_9/perspectives_on_christmas.html)_"Perspectives on Christmas."_]
    
     **Albert:** Hold it, Crane.  I got real business here.  Can you tell us
             when we're going to be able to get our cars back into the
             parking garage?
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, uh, the lines should get their second coat tomorrow,
             and if it doesn't rain, they should be dry by the end of the
             week.
     **Albert:** Uh huh, and in the meantime we have to park out on the street!
     **Martin:** I know it's a little inconvenient, but...
     **Albert:** Inconvenient?!  I got a ticket!
      **Jerry:**[_another tenant_] Yeah! My wife got towed.
     **Martin:** But after it's done we'll have wider parking spaces.
    **Cecilia:**[_another tenant_] If you make them wider, aren't we going to
             lose some spaces?  Where are those people supposed to go?
     **Martin:** Um, well, uh, maybe we could take turns.
    
    [_The crowd is beginning to get angry, responding with "Take turns?!, 
    etc.  Frasier begins to show some empathy toward his ambushed father
    in his facial expressions._]
    
     **Martin:** Does everybody here need their car?
    
    [_The crowd again shouts all at once._]
    
     **Albert:** Of course we need a car!
      **Jerry:** Have you got a copy of the feasability report?
     **Martin:**[_shuffling through papers_] Yeah, feasibility report, uh, yes,
             the, um, feasibility report.
     **Albert:** You only have one piece of paper there.
       **Paul:** How long will it take before we get them painted back the
             right way?
      **Jerry:** And who's going to pay for all the tickets we get?
    **Cecilia:** I had to lug my groceries three blocks!
    
    [_They continue to murmur all at once._]
    
     **Martin:** Look, I'm sorry, I...
       **Paul:** What, did you just hire a guy with a can of paint?
     **Martin:**[_feigning outrage_] No!
    
    [_The crowd increases in its unrest.  Martin has clearly lost control
    of the situation.  Frasier suddenly rises._]
    
    **Frasier:** People! People!  If you'd just let him talk, he could explain.
             My father is currently in negotiations with a salvage company
             to remove the old boiler room, which would give us the extra
             spaces we need.
       **Paul:** Where are we going to park in the meantime?
    **Frasier:** My father has already discussed with the building next door
             sharing their parking spaces.  Isn't that right, Dad?
     **Martin:**[_thankful for the bailout, he pretends to check the papers_]
             Uh...Yeah, right!
       **Paul:** We should have had more faith in you!  You've had a lot of
             good ideas so far.
     **Martin:** Well, actually, I've got something to tell you about those
             good ideas.
    **Frasier:** Dad. [_He frantically rubs his nose and shakes his head._]
     **Martin:** All that good stuff...all the stuff you were crazy about...
             it all came from Frasier. [_He rises and moves toward his son._]
             From the very beginning, he's been the one running things and
             I think we should give him a little credit. [_He pats Frasier
             on the shoulder._]
    **Frasier:** Well thank you, Dad, that's very kind of you.
     **Martin:** In fact, uh, having me run was Frasier's idea.
    **Frasier:**[_attempting to interrupt, frantically rubbing his nose again_]
             Dad!
     **Martin:**[_waving him off_] He figured that...he figured that you'd go
             for his policies if they came from somebody else.
     **Albert:**[_shaking his finger_] So this whole thing was a scam.
     **Martin:** Well, I wouldn't call it a scam.  It was just a fake-out.
      **Jerry:** Frasier, how could you do your father like this?
    **Richman:** He's always wanted to be president, but I never thought he
             would stoop this low!
     **Martin:** All right, that's enough!  My son is the best thing that ever
             happened to this condo board, but you guys are too petty to
             see it!  Well, you people don't deserve him!  And if you don't
             want him, you don't get me either.  I resign.  Come on, Fras.
             [_He heads for the exit._]
    **Frasier:** Right behind you, Dad.
      **Jerry:** Now what do we do?
       **Paul:** Well, technically, when the president resigns, the runner-up
             takes power.
    
    [_In exiting, Frasier hears this and stops in the doorway.  Everyone
    looks back at him, stunned._]
    
    **Frasier:** That's right, isn't it?  Well.  It's not the way I would have
             liked it, but bylaws are bylaws.  So as your president, I 
             would like to quote a man who understands the language of
             the people!
    
    [_He makes an obscene gesture with his hand, which is hidden from the
    camera by Cecilia's head. (Well, they had to conform to prime-time
    network standards, after all!)  He quickly exits, leaving the entire
    crowd shocked, offended, and beaten.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits**
    Roz is at the counter of Cafe Nervosa talking to the waiter.  The
    "non-traditional sex enthusiast" approaches her from a stool, 
    introduces himself, shakes her hand, and gives her his card.  She
    looks at it with a sudden horrified expression and quickly exits,
    leaving the swinger wondering what is up.
