## Transcript {Kelly Dean Hansen}

    
    
    _**Skyline:** Lights come on in various buildings._
    
    _ACT I_
    
    [_Scene 1 - A small specialty foods store.  Frasier and Niles walk in._]
    
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, get a cart.
    **Frasier:** Oh, could you get it, Niles, please?  They're so small they
             make me feel like I'm some sort of fairy tale giant.
    
    [_Niles gets a cart.  It looks like a child's toy._]
    
      **Niles:** Hey, any thoughts about what to serve?
    **Frasier:** Well, I thought we might serve a house-cured gravlax with crï¿½me
             fraiche and a sprig of dill.
      **Niles:** Oh, in other words the usual.
    **Frasier:** For your information, Niles, people happen to like it.
      **Niles:** Yes, people _like_ animated musicals.
    
    [_NB: I can't let this pass.  I _love_ animated musicals.  
    And both Kelsey and David have done voice parts in animated musicals.  
    So there! - Kelly Dean Hansen_]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, honestly.
      **Niles:** Frasier, look!  Caviar.
    **Frasier:** They haven't had any in ages.  This is just what we need to make
             our soiree soignee. [_chuckles and examines the caviar_]  Whoa.
             Good heavens.  It's $100 an ounce.
      **Niles:** Well, it must be mis-marked. [_to the owner_] Excuse me!  Is the
             Beluga really $100 an ounce?
     **Robert:**[_heavy French accent_] Yes.
    **Frasier:** Well, isn't that rather a lot to pay?
     **Robert:** To you, yes.  To the fish who gave up her life so that you could
             spread her unborn children on a cracker, it's not so much.
    
    [_N.B. Francois Giroday reprises his role as Robert from_ [[5.17], _"The Perfect Guy"._](/frasier/transcripts/season_5/episode_17/the_perfect_guy.html)]
    
    [_A man in black, with a leather jacket, approaches them._]
    
      **Petyr:**[_heavy Russian accent_] You know, the reason for such high prices
             is the Russian mafia.  They control this market.
      **Niles:**[_stupidly_] The Russian mafia controls Robert's Gourmet Goodies?
    **Frasier:**[_impatient with Niles_] He means the _caviar_ market, you ninny.
      **Petyr:** I have Beluga for sale.  Top quality, fair price.
    
    [_Petyr gestures for them to follow them.  He exits the store.  
    Somewhat surprised, they follow him out to the patio._]
    
      **Petyr:**[_handing Frasier a card_] The name is Petyr.  I recently arrived
             on my cousin's ship, the _Caspian Queen_ with beautiful
             Beluga caviar.  But because of those gangsters, we cannot sell.
             So I do it like this.  Quietly.  How much you want?
    **Frasier:** How do we know this isn't some sort of scam?
      **Petyr:** It's no scam. 
    
    [_He reaches for a bottle inside his coat, and hands it to 
    Frasier._] 
    
      **Petyr:** Look inside. 
    
    [_Frasier looks at the caviar, stunned.  Petyr pulls out a cloth 
    napkin._] 
    
      **Petyr:** You taste!
    
    [_Frasier and Niles each take small spoons from the napkin.  While 
    Frasier samples the caviar, Niles wipes down his spoon with his 
    trusty handkerchief.  Frasier's face expresses that the caviar is 
    divine._]
    
    **Frasier:** You really must try this, Niles.
    
    [_Niles does so.  His facial expression is equally ecstatic.  Petyr gives
    them a questioning look._]
    
      **Niles:** It's like being kissed by a lusty mermaid!
    
    [_Petyr takes back the spoons.  Niles is still licking his as it is taken._]
    
      **Petyr:** So, you are interested, yes?
    **Frasier:** Maybe, but how can we be sure that you are not Russian mafia
             yourself?
      **Petyr:**[_gravely_] Because for six generations my family fished the Caspian.
             Then ten years ago, the bastards come.  They burn my father's
             boat. [_with increasing passion_] They steal my mother's salt so she
             cannot prepare the roe.  And if they know I sell Beluga for $40 an
             ounce!  They would cut out my tongue and pluck out my eyes!
      **Niles:** Did you say $40 an ounce?
    
    [_Petyr nods and smiles.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment.
    Daphne is preparing the table.  Niles is pacing.  Frasier is also waiting._]
    
      **Niles:** Shouldn't our caviar be here by now?
    **Frasier:** It'll be here, Niles, I gave Roz explicit instructions.
      **Niles:** What if we've been swindled?  What if the tins are filled with
             sand?
    **Frasier:** Niles, I am, as you know, an excellent judge of character.  And
             in Petyr, I saw an honest, hard-working fisherman.
     **Daphne:** Why didn't you have him deliver it here?
    **Frasier:** What?  I don't want him knowing where I live!
    
    [_The doorbell rings.  Frasier answers.  Roz is wearing sunglasses._]
    
       **Roz:** The Russian bear hunts by night!
    **Frasier:** Very funny, Roz, come on.  Give me that. [_She hands him a small
             insulated cooler._] All right, let's have a look.
    
    [_He opens the cooler and grabs a tin.  He and Niles look at it and speak
    with awe and wonder._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_whispering in awe_] Oh!  Niles!
    
    [_Niles swoons.  Frasier beams._]
    
     **Daphne:** It's beautiful.
        **Roz:** I don't get what the big deal is about caviar.  I had it once.
             It was nothing special.
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, a lot of things can affect caviar.  Where did you 
             have it?
        **Roz:** On a mini-bagel at the Tucson Doubletree.
    
    [_Niles immediately offers Roz the tin._]
    
      **Niles:** Here, try this.
        **Roz:**[_sampling the caviar_] Hmmm.  Wow.
    **Frasier:** Mm-hmm.
        **Roz:** That's good.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Roz:** That's really good.  What's your little party for tonight?
    **Frasier:** Invited guests.  I'm sorry, Roz.
        **Roz:** What?
    **Frasier:**[_shepherding Roz out the door_] Thank you for your help.  See
             you later.
    
    [_Martin enters as Roz exits._]
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hey, Roz.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey!  Hey, everybody.  Check this out!  I just went to the ATM
             for $20, as you can see from this receipt, and it gave me $60.
             I won 40 bucks!
      **Niles:** You mean the bank lost $40.
     **Martin:** Uh, yeah, that big faceless bank that charges me $12 a month for
             my checking account lost $40. 
    
    [_He hangs up his coat._]
    
     **Daphne:** You know, you can't keep that.  It's bad karma.
     **Martin:** Sorry.  This is America.  A land built on the principle, "Finders
             Keepers."
     **Daphne:** Oh, come on.  There's a toll-free service number right here on
             the receipt.  Just call them and tell them what happened.
     **Martin:** Why should I?
     **Daphne:** Because otherwise, you could end up like my brother Nigel and his
             baby teeth.
    
    [_General silence.  The three Crane men all roll their eyes and look at each
    other uncomfortably.  After a long pause, Niles takes the inevitable "Daphne
    family story" bait._]
    
      **Niles:**[_deadpan_] What happened with your brother Nigel and his baby teeth?
     **Daphne:** Well, like any child, the first time he had a tooth fall out he put
             it under his pillow at bedtime, and sure enough, the next morning
             he found that Winston Churchill had left him a shiny new coin.
     **Martin:** Question.
      **Niles:** No, Dad, we're not stopping.  Go ahead, Darling.
     **Daphne:** Well, instead of being grateful, he got greedy and went off to
             school, punching people in their mouths and scooping up their
             teeth. [_Martin reacts to this._] Of course, it didn't work and
             he got kicked out of school, became a thief, and eventually 
             went to prison.
    
    [_Martin doesn't "get it."  He looks at Frasier, who tries to lead Daphne
    to the story's "moral."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Where he... fittingly had all of his teeth knocked out...?
     **Daphne:** No, he lost his teeth years earlier in a rock-eating contest.
             Now that's an interesting story.  We were renting a house next
             to a quarry at the time...
     **Martin:**[_unwilling to take any more_] All right, all right, I'll call the
             bank!
    
    [_He rises.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 3 - Frasier's apartment.
    The soiree is going very well.  Frasier is speaking to a couple._]
    
     **Mr. Michaels:** Very kind of you to have us here, Crane.
    **Mrs. Michaels:** Yes, it's wonderful.  But then you must be used to hosting
                   successful parties.
          **Frasier:**[_matter-of-factly_] Oh, not really.  Something's usually on
                   fire by now.
    **Mrs. Michaels:** Oh, you're funny.
          **Frasier:** No, I'm serious.
     **Mr. Michaels:** Now, tell me.  How can we get our hands on some of this
                   fantastic caviar?
          **Frasier:** Well, I wish I could tell you but it's uh... a private
                   source.
     **Mr. Michaels:** Well, perhaps I should mention then that, uh, this is for
                   our yacht party, at which there just might be room enough
                   for another guest.
          **Frasier:** Okay, what are we talking here?
     **Mr. Michaels:** Well, maybe five, six ounces?
          **Frasier:**[_sucking up_] Let me go see what's in the refrigerator.
     **Mr. Michaels:** Thatta boy, Crane!
    
    [_Frasier exits to the kitchen, where Niles is gathering the tins of caviar.
    Martin is on the phone, in the background._]
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, what are you doing?
      **Niles:** Oh, good news.  Emile Sinclair is crazy about the caviar.  If we
             sell him the rest, he distinctly implied he could get our squash
             lockers moved further from the showers.  Isn't that fantastic?
     **Martin:**[_on the phone, enunciating_] Per-son-al.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it would be, Niles, if the Michaelses weren't equally
             enamored of it and dangling an invitation to a yacht party.
      **Niles:**[_gasping_] That is a pickle!
     **Martin:**[_to the phone_] Check-ing.
    **Frasier:** Niles, why don't we just call Petyr and order some more caviar?
             That way we can satisfy both Sinclair and the Michaels.
     **Martin:** Cus-to-mer Ser-vice!
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, this caviar connection could really open some
             doors for us, hmm?
     **Martin:**[_now yelling into the phone_] Per-son-al!
      **Niles:** What you doing, Dad?
     **Martin:** Oh, this stupid bank's automated voice system.  It's like a maze!
    **Frasier:** All right, give it here. [_taking the phone_] You just push "O,"
             and you'll get an operator.  Little trick I learned.  Another
             menu, hmm.  Sometimes it's a star. [_He tries it._] All right,
             maybe "1" will get me back to a main menu.  Ah.  Here you go.
     **Martin:** Got me to the right department?
    **Frasier:** No, but if I remember my high school Spanish correctly, you just
             qualified for a small-business loan.
    
    [_Martin is frustrated.  He takes the phone.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 4 - Bank lobby.
    Daphne and Martin approach the counter.  A male teller greets them._]
    
     **Teller:** Hi, can I help you?
     **Martin:** Yes, uh, I was at one of your ATM's yesterday, and it gave me
             back more than it should have, so I want to...
     **Teller:**[_interrupting_] Okay, for that you're going to need to complete
             an ATM trouble report [_producing one_] and then take it to our
             operations officer at the desk over there.
     **Martin:** You mean I have to fill this out before I can give you 40 bucks?
     **Teller:** Yes, sir.
     **Martin:** But your sign says, "Making banking simpler!"
     **Teller:** Yes, sir.
     **Martin:** Well, this isn't simpler, it's more complicated.
     **Teller:** Yes, sir, it is.
     **Martin:** Oh, forget it.  
    
    [_He and Daphne leave the counter and walk to a table._] 
    
     **Martin:** I knew this was going to be more trouble than it's
             worth.
     **Daphne:** A little paperwork's a small price to pay for a clear conscience.
     **Martin:** Yeah, meanwhile, I'm out 40 bucks.
     **Daphne:** It's not your money!
    
    [_They approach the desk indicated by the teller.  A male officer greets
    them._]
    
    **Officer:** Can I help you?
     **Martin:** Yes, uh, I had some trouble with one of your ATM's.
    **Officer:** Oh, I can't help you.  I need a manager. 
    
    [_He exits to the rear._]
    
     **Daphne:** I'm proud of you.  Trust me, when this is over, you'll feel
             better.
     **Martin:** You really think so?
     **Daphne:** I'm sure of it.
     **Martin:** Ah, maybe you're right.  Maybe I will feel better.  And if
             you're right about that karma stuff, I got a good thing
             coming to me.
     **Daphne:**[_looking out the window_] Uh-oh.  How much money did you put
             in the meter?
     **Martin:** Oh, son of a bitch!
    
    [_The bank manager, a woman, enters._]
    
    **Manager:** Hi, Mr. Crane, I'm Bree, Todd's manager.  I wanted to apologize
             for the trouble you had with our ATM.  And make sure that you
             got your $40. 
    
    [_She offers him the cash._]
    
     **Martin:** What, uh, oh, no, no!  You don't need to give anything to me.
             The machine accidentally gave me $60 instead of $20, so I need
             to give _you_ $40.
    **Manager:** So, you want to put this in your account?
    
    [_Daphne rolls her eyes._]
    
     **Martin:** No, no!  I want you to take it, plus this $40, and put it back
             wherever it came from.
    **Manager:** Well, I'm afraid I've already done the paperwork.  Now, you'll
             need to speak with our branch manager, and he's out of town.
     **Martin:** This is ridiculous!
    **Manager:** I'm sorry.  Although, there is one other possibility.  Let me
             try something.
     **Martin:** Thank you.
    **Manager:** Don't mention it.
    
    [_She picks up the phone and dials.  Martin glares at Daphne._]
    
    **Manager:**[_in the "enunciating" tone previously used by Martin_] Per-son-al.
    
    [_Martin sighs and sinks into a chair.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 5 -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier and Niles are seated.  Niles is checking "order slips."_]
    
      **Niles:** Sandoval, four ounces.
    **Frasier:** Right.
      **Niles:** Smoot, five ounces.
    **Frasier:** Right.
      **Niles:** McBean, ten ounces.
    **Frasier:** Hmm, ten?
      **Niles:** Yes, I know it's a lot, but he promised me the use of his
             Sonoma estate.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, for ten he should.  You know, for eight, the Ashworths
             gave me the use of their box on the opera's opening night gala.
      **Niles:** But that's the same weekend as the black and white ball?  When
             are we going to sleep?
    
    [_They laugh cheerily._]
    
    **Frasier:** Sleep is for people without social lives.
    
    [_They continue to chuckle and clink their coffee cups.  Roz approaches._]
    
        **Roz:** So, boys, where's my cut?
      **Niles:** What are you talking about?
    **Frasier:** I promised her a cut, you see, I was so busy at work taking
             orders I needed her help.
        **Roz:** You know what it's really good on?  Scrambled eggs.  And pizza.
             And potato skins!
    **Frasier:** Yes, Roz, welcome to caviar.
        **Roz:** At work, during the show, I'm just sitting there thinking, "Two
             hours to caviar.  One hour to caviar."  You don't have any on
             you do you?
    
    [_Frasier and Niles exchange glances._]
    
      **Niles:** Uh, no, no, we're expecting some momentarily.
        **Roz:** Cool.  You think it'd be good on a cheese Danish?  I think it
             would.  I'm getting one.
    
    [_She rises.  Petyr approaches the table with a small cooler._]
    
      **Petyr:** Gentlemen.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Petyr, hello!
      **Petyr:** Yes, hello, but I'm afraid also goodbye.
    **Frasier:** Hmm, what?
      **Niles:** What-what do you mean, goodbye?
      **Petyr:** All these orders I fill for you, it draws too much attention.
             It's too risky for me.
    **Frasier:** What-what are you saying, that there's no more caviar?
      **Petyr:**[_placing the cooler on the table_] This is my last delivery.
    **Frasier:**[_looking inside frantically_] But this isn't nearly enough!
      **Niles:** We've made commitments to some very powerful people.  If we
             disappoint them, there's no telling what they might do!
      **Petyr:** They will break legs?  Cut off thumbs?
      **Niles:** Worse!  There'll be gossip.
    **Frasier:** Petyr, please, just one more delivery!
      **Petyr:**[_rising_] I cannot, the danger is too great. 
    
    [_He exits._]
    
    **Frasier:** Petyr! [_gasping_] Dear God!  We're ruined, Niles.  We owe people
             all over town.
      **Niles:** I know.
        **Roz:** Is some of that mine?  Can I have it now?
    **Frasier:** Roz, Roz, I'm terribly sorry.  It seems our supplier is going
             out of business, and every ounce of this is spoken for.
        **Roz:** Well, that's too bad.  Oh, well, whatever, I was thinking of
             giving it up, anyway.  Too much salt.
    **Frasier:** Yes, good girl.  All right, Niles, we can't panic.  I think
             I may have a plan.
      **Niles:**[_sarcastically_] I like it.
    **Frasier:** We may have to bite the bullet and buy retail.
      **Niles:** Petyr's stuff is much better quality.  Our friends will notice
             the difference.
    **Frasier:** Not if we cut it with what's left of the good stuff.
      **Niles:** Well, how much is there?
    **Frasier:** There's... 
    
    [_He notices the cooler is gone, as is Roz_]  
    
    **Frasier:** Roz!!
    
    [_They chase after her.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT I
    
    ACT II_
    
    [_Scene 6 - Robert's Gourmet Shop.
    Frasier and Niles enter worriedly._]
    
      **Niles:** This will cost us a fortune.
    **Frasier:** Well, what else can we do? [_approaching Robert_] Excuse me.  Do
             you happen to know where we can get [_pausing_] five pounds of
             Beluga caviar?
     **Robert:** There's not that much Beluga in all of Seattle.
      **Niles:** Thank you. 
    
    [_They move away._] 
    
      **Niles:** What are we going to do?
    **Frasier:** All right, just give me a chance to think, Niles.  Ah...
             What was the name of the boat...
      **Niles:**[_enthusiastically interrupting_] _H.M.S. Bounty!_
    **Frasier:**[_glaring with irritation_] This isn't Trivial Pursuit.  Let
             me finish!  What was the name of the boat that Petyr said he
             sailed on?
      **Niles:**_Caspian Queen._
    **Frasier:** Right!  Niles, if we can find that boat, perhaps we can get
             enough caviar to solve our problem.
    
    [_Roz enters.  Upon seeing them, she quickly spins the other way, but
    they have already seen her._]
    
    **Frasier:** Roz?
        **Roz:**[_emerging_] Hey, what are you guys doing here?
      **Niles:** I think the question is, what are _you_ doing here?
        **Roz:** You know, shopping, for stuff... 
    
    [_She pretends to look at the merchandise._]
    
    **Frasier:** You're looking for more caviar, aren't you?
        **Roz:** Of course I am!  You took all mine!
    **Frasier:** That was _ours!_  You know, Roz, I think you may have a
             little problem.
        **Roz:**[_desperately_] You're the one with the problem!  Not me.  This is
             all your fault.  You made me try it.  Now I crave it!  I really
             hate you!
    **Frasier:** Now, Roz, you know you don't mean that.  Now, come on.  Listen.
             It's just possible that we may be able to get some more from
             our old supplier.
        **Roz:**[_excitedly_] Is that true?  Is he right?  I'm sorry I said I hate
             you.
    **Frasier:** Roz, Roz, it's all right.
        **Roz:** Are you going to get it today?  I love you!
    
    [_She throws her arms around Frasier.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 7 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin is ready to relax in his chair.  As he sits, the phone rings.  
    He reluctantly begins to rise, when the doorbell rings.  He falls back 
    in his chair.  Again the phone rings.  He rises and, after indecision, 
    answers the phone._]
    
     **Martin:** Hello?  Oh, no I'm sorry.  Frasier isn't here.  [_becoming irritated_]
             Sure you can place an order. [_irritated singsong_] Let me transfer
             you to that department.
    
    [_The doorbell rings again as Martin is speaking.  He hangs up and 
    opens the door.  It is Daphne, carrying her supplies and the mail._]
    
     **Martin:** Hi, Daph. 
     **Daphne:** Hello.  The postman gave me your mail.
     **Martin:** Oh, thanks.
     **Daphne:** You ready to get stretched?
     **Martin:** Oh, you mean we're working out today?
     **Daphne:**[_impatiently_] We work out every day. 
    
    [_She begins to set up._]
    
     **Martin:** Yeah, I know. [_examining mail_] Oh, postcard from the bank!  
             Uh, "Dear Mr. Crane, we apologize for the inconvenience.  
             We have evaluated your request [_with amazed irritation_] 
             and credited your account $80?!"
    
    [_Scene 8 - Bank lobby.
    Martin is in line.  Daphne quickly enters._]
    
     **Daphne:** There's no spaces.  I parked your car in a loading zone.
     **Martin:** No, no, no, just pull around front and wait for me.  This won't
             take long.
     **Daphne:** You're sure?
     **Martin:** Yes.  And you better get back to the car before Eddie starts
             to panic.
    
    [_Daphne rushes out.  Martin approaches the counter.  The teller is
    female._]
    
     **Teller:**[_cheerily_] Hi!  How can I help _you_ make banking simpler?
     **Martin:**[_agitated_] I'll tell you how you can help me.  I'm going to talk,
             and you're going to listen, and you're going to do exactly as I
             ask.
     **Teller:**[_apprehensive_] I think I should go get a manager.
     **Martin:**[_angrily_] No, no managers!
     **Teller:** Oh, but our policy is...
     **Martin:** Now this is real simple and I know you can handle it.  Now what
             I want you to do is... [_as he speaks, he reaches inside his coat_]
      **Guard:** Hold it right there, Mister!
    
    [_He turns and sees the guard pointing a gun at him.  He quickly raises
    his hands._]
    
    [_Scene 9 - Bank lobby.
    Time fade.  Martin and Daphne are seated at the back desk.  Daphne is
    holding Eddie.  A dignified, bearded gentleman speaks to them._]
    
    **President:** Mr. Crane, as the president of the bank, I want to assure
               you that it is not our policy to draw firearms on customers
               trying to make a deposit.
    
    [_Daphne rolls her eyes and tosses her head back._]
    
       **Martin:**[_wearily_] It wasn't a deposit.
    **President:** Now, I'm sure that neither of us wants to turn this into
               a protracted legal battle, so if you would simply sign this
               non-disclosure agreement here, here, here, and here...
               [_Martin puts on his eyeglasses._] Our attorneys have authorized
               me to compensate you for your troubles in the amount of
               $10,000, which can be credited to your account.
    
    [_Martin and Daphne are stunned._]
    
       **Martin:** Ten grand?!
    **President:** Plus the $40 from our original mistake.
    
    [_Martin gives Daphne a look, seeking "approval."  She obviously grants it._]
    
       **Martin:**[_feigning weariness_] Oh, what the hell, I just want to get it
               over with. [_He signs the forms._]
    **President:** That's wonderful.  Now, is there anything else I can do for you?
       **Daphne:**[_bemused_] Could I open an account?
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    **THEY CALL HIM VLAD THE IMPORTER**
    
    [_Scene 10 - A dark ship's interior.
    Frasier calls from above and descends a ladder.  Two Russians sailors
    are seated, playing chess._]
    
     **Frasier:** Ahoy?  Ahoy?  Is anyone there? [_He descends into the cabin._]
    **Vladimir:** Who is there?
     **Frasier:** Oh, hello.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, and this is my brother, Dr.
              Niles Crane.  Uh, we're interested in purchasing some Beluga
              caviar.
    **Vladimir:** This is not a shop.  I have nothing for sale.
       **Niles:** See, let's go.
     **Frasier:** No, no, no, Niles, Niles.  This is how the game is played.
              Maybe he thinks we're Russian mafia.
       **Niles:** Oh, yes, people make that mistake about us all the time.
     **Frasier:** Petyr gave us this card, and told us that this was his cousin's
              boat.  Are you sure you can't help us?
    
    [_The second sailor takes the card and speaks to Vladimir in Russian.  
    He responds and they laugh heartily.  Frasier and Niles play along 
    and laugh with them._]
    
    **Vladimir:** How much do you need?
     **Frasier:** Five pounds.
    
    [_Vladimir gives instructions to the other sailor in Russian, who goes
    to fetch the caviar.  Frasier takes the empty seat._]
    
    **Vladimir:** $80 an ounce.
     **Frasier:** Well, we were paying $40.
    **Vladimir:** And now you pay 80.
     **Frasier:**[_attempting to bargain_] 50.
    **Vladimir:** 80.
     **Frasier:** 60.
    **Vladimir:** 80.
       **Niles:** I don't think you're doing this right.
     **Frasier:**[_glaring at Niles_] 70, that's my final offer!
    **Vladimir:** 80.
     **Frasier:** Done!
    
    [_The other sailor approaches with a huge tub of caviar and places it
    on the table._]
    
     **Frasier:** I want to taste it first.
    **Vladimir:** Go ahead.
    
    [_Niles has pulled out napkins and tiny spoons, but Frasier simply uses
    his fingers.  With apprehension, he samples the caviar.  Niles observes._]
    
     **Frasier:**[_relieved and delighted_] That's the stuff.
       **Niles:** That's enough to take care of everyone and still go out on top.
     **Frasier:** Yes, all right, here's your money.  Pleasure doing business
              with you.
    
    [_A voice on a loudspeaker is suddenly heard outside._]
    
       **Agent:** Stop where you are!  U.S. Customs!
    
    [_The Russians frantically scramble out of the cabin.  Frasier and Niles
    run around in sheer panic._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, my God!
      **Niles:** Frasier, we have to get rid of it!
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!  Oh, dear God!  Oh, dear God!  Oh, dear God!
      **Niles:** All right, all right, we have to hide it!
    **Frasier:**[_shouting_] No, Niles, you can't hide it!  They're U.S. Customs.
             That's what they do!  They find things on ships!
      **Niles:** All right.  I know one way to get rid of it.
    
    [_He pulls out his tiny caviar spoon and begins frantically scooping it
    into his mouth._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_incredulous_] Can I get you a toast point?  Oh, here, for God's
             sakes.
    
    [_They both begin to scoop caviar into their mouths with their bare hands.
    They spill it all over the table in the process.  They continue to scoop
    rapidly as the officer enters the cabin.  When they raise their heads,
    their faces are covered with black fish eggs, as are their hands._]
    
      **Agent:** What the hell's all this?
    **Frasier:**[_like a deer in the headlights, his mouth still full_] It's not
             ours.  We found it.
      **Agent:** What, the caviar?
      **Niles:**[_mouth full_] Is that what this is?
      **Agent:** Relax, we don't care about that.  We're looking for a couple of
             Russians who've been smuggling DVD's.
    
    [_They indicate the direction the Russians ran.  The officer stares at
    them for a moment, bemused.  He then recovers himself and rushes out
    in that direction._]
    
      **Niles:** My heart is pounding!
    **Frasier:** I was afraid we were going to get arrested.
      **Niles:** What have we become?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.  We got caught up in a nefarious scheme.  And for
             what?  A visit to a wine country estate?
      **Niles:** A box at the opera?
    **Frasier:** Dinner at the governor's mansion? 
    
    [_A pause._] 
    
    **Frasier:** How much of this do you think we can salvage?
      **Niles:** I don't know, just start scraping.
    
    [_They begin to scrape the caviar off their faces and hands back into the
    tub.  They also collect what has spilled onto the table.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits:**
    The brothers are placing the caviar in tins to fill their orders.  Niles
    spills some on his sweater and runs into the kitchen.  Frasier follows.
    Eddie leaps onto the table and begins to eat from the large caviar tub.
    Frasier and Niles re-enter, horrified, and shoo him away.  After taking 
    a moment to recover, they continue to fill the tins as before._
