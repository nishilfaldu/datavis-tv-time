    **Skyline:** Plane with KACL banner.
    
    _ACT I
    
    Scene 1 - KACL
    Frasier is taking a call._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Morrie, if you're not cheating on your wife, and she 
             still suspects you, then we're obviously dealing with a trust 
             issue.
     **Morrie:**[_v.o._] More like a crazy issue.  And I know where she gets it, 
             from her mother -- who, by the way, came for Thanksgiving and 
             still hasn't left.  Happy New Year!
    **Frasier:** Perhaps we should tackle these issues one at a time...
    
    _Over the line Frasier hears loud knocking._
    
     **Morrie:** I'm in the bathroom, Celeste!  A little privacy?! [_into phone_] 
             See how she gets?
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps what is needed here is...
    
    _There is a click as Celeste picks up on another phone._
    
    **Celeste:**[_v.o._] You think I don't know who you're talking to in there, 
             huh, Morrie?  It's your little whore, isn't it?  Hello, whore.
    **Frasier:** Celeste, if I could interrupt for just a moment...
    **Celeste:** A man?!  It's worse than I thought.
    
    _Another click._
    
     **Mother:**[_v.o._] Celeste?
    **Celeste:** Hang up, Ma!
     **Mother:** You're all on the radio.  I'm listening down in the kitchen.
     **Morrie:** How about washing a dish or two while you're down there?
    
    _Yet another click._
    
    **Britney:**[_v.o._] I cannot stand this yelling!  I'm running away from home.
     **Morrie:** Oh, hang up the phone, Britney, you're going nowhere.
    **Frasier:** And neither is this conversation. [_He cuts off the line._] 
             Well, that's our show for today, with a brief program 
             note.  My KACL colleagues and I are competing against 
             a team at KPXY to see who can shed the most pounds for 
             charity.  We're off to  our first weigh-in right now.  
             You can keep track of our progress  on Channel 6's 
             _Coffee with Kelly_.  Wish us luck.
    
    _Bulldog, Kenny, Gil, and Noel rapidly enter the studio carrying cake 
    boxes, bags, etc._
    
    **Bulldog:** Okay, everybody, let's power this crap down.
    **Frasier:** Why?
      **Kenny:** The more you eat before the contest, the more you artificially 
             boost your starting weight.
    
    _They all begin to eat voraciously, except Frasier._
    
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, we got cheeseburgers, donuts, french fries, tacos...
        **Gil:** And a duck confit that's as rich as Donald Trump and twice as 
             greasy.
    **Frasier:** Well, it hardly seems in the spirit of the competition.  The 
             entire purpose here is to raise awareness about the obesity 
             epidemic in this country...
    
    _He is interrupted by Bulldog shoving a cheeseburger in his face._
    
        **Roz:** Come on, Frasier, the winning team gets a free trip to Vegas!
    
    _All except Frasier cheer._
    
        **Gil:** Four glorious days in Sin City, with all its gaudy brilliance, 
             the feathered headdresses, the fishnet stockings...[_He eats a 
             morsel._]
      **Kenny:** I'm just wearing an aloha shirt, myself.
    **Bulldog:** Come on, Shempsky, pick up the pace.
       **Noel:** I have a digestive disorder where if I eat too much or too 
             little I get incapacitating stomach cramps.
        **Roz:** It's OK, Noel, you do what's right for you. [_suggestively, 
             moving closer to him_] But wouldn't a trip to Vegas be really 
             fun?  And remember, what happens in Vegas... [_enticingly 
             brings a donut to his face_] stays in Vegas.
    
    _He quickly begins to devour the donut from her hand._
    
    **Bulldog:** Eat up, Doc!
    **Frasier:** I will do no such thing!  It is not fair, and it is 
             unsportsmanlike.
    **Bulldog:** Ah, who's it gonna hurt?
    
    _Noel doubles over in pain and groans._
    
    **Bulldog:** Shake it off, kid, nobody likes a whiner.
    
    _Bulldog slaps Noel's head.  
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **PIGEON DROPPING**
    
    _Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment
    Martin opens the door to Niles and Daphne_
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles, Daph.
     **Daphne:**[_rushing to the powder room_] Oh, no time for chitchat, 
             pregnant lady coming through.
     **Martin:**[_noticing that Niles has a bandage on his hand_] What happened
             to your wrist?
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, she rolled over in her sleep and pinned me again.  
             I even saw it coming this time, like the big rock in that 
             _Indiana Jones_ movie. [_He hangs his coat._]
     **Martin:** Does she know she did it?
      **Niles:** No, no, no, I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I just--
             I just, uh, made up an excuse... [_looking out to the balcony_] 
             What is Eddie doing?
    
    _Martin sits in his chair.  While he is speaking, Niles, notices 
    something on the window, wipes it away with his handkerchief._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, he's waiting for a pigeon friend of his.  We call him 
             Barney.  Flies on the balcony every day and they stare at 
             each other.  Those crazy animals.  Yesterday they did it 
             for three hours.
    
    _Niles scoffs in disbelief as he sits on the couch._
    
     **Martin:** No, I'm not making it up, I watched them the whole time.
    
    _As Niles sits, he bumps his sore wrist.  Daphne exits the powder room
    and sees him wince._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, is your wrist still bothering you, dear?
      **Niles:** Oh, just a little flare-up.
     **Daphne:** Poor thing slept on it funny.  Woke up screaming like a dying
             rabbit.
    
    _She sits.  Frasier enters.  They greet him._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, how was the weigh-in?
    **Frasier:** Oh, it was appalling, thank you.  My teammates ridiculed me 
             for not pigging out beforehand.  You know what is it about 
             teams and, and competitions that just brings out the worst in 
             people?
    
    _He hangs his coat._
    
     **Martin:** Here we go again.
     **Daphne:** What?
      **Niles:** Well, Frasier and team sports are not a happy mix.  Freshman 
             year, in a bid to please Dad...
    **Frasier:** There is no need to tell that story.
      **Niles:** Frasier inadvertently joined the girls' field hockey team.
    **Frasier:**[_off their chuckles_] The sign-up sheet said "F. Hockey."  
             I assumed it meant "freshman" hockey.
     **Martin:** The little plaid skirt didn't tip you off?
    **Frasier:**[_seething_] I thought it was a kilt! 
    
    _He exits._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm starving.  Where should we go for dinner?
    
    _A loud thud is heard against the balcony window._
    
     **Daphne:** What was that?
     **Martin:**[_gasping_] Barney!  Oh, Daph, would you take Eddie to my room?  
             I don't want him to see this.
     **Daphne:** Come on, boy, come on now. 
    
    _She and Eddie exit.  Martin and Niles go to the window._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, how did this happen?
      **Niles:** Oh, now, Dad, birds do fly into windows.
     **Martin:** I know, that's why I keep a safety smudge right there... huh, 
             where'd it go?
    
    _Niles realizes.  Martin rounds on him._
    
     **Martin:** Niles!
      **Niles:** I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.  It's, it's a reflex.  I-I, I don't even 
             know I'm doing it.
    
    _They exit to the balcony and stare down._
    
     **Martin:** Are you happy?  You killed Eddie's little friend.  Poor little 
             guy. [_then_] Well, what should we do, just kick him over the 
             edge?
      **Niles:** Dad, wait, he's still breathing!
     **Martin:** Oh!  Pick him up!
      **Niles:** But birds are notorious carriers of disease.
     **Martin:** Oh, here, use my hanky.
      **Niles:**[_rejecting the hanky_] I'll take my chances. 
    
    _He picks up the bird._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, don't you quit on us, Barney!  You're gonna be good as 
             new.
    
    _They head back inside.  But Niles is watching Barney so intently that 
    he bumps his own head on the glass._
    
     **Martin:**[_as they re-enter_] See, that's why we need a safety smudge.
    
    _FADE TO: 
    
    Scene 3 - Channel 6 studio
    Host Kelly is wrapping up with a chef._
    
    [_N.B. Bess Armstrong reprises her role as morning-show host Kelly 
    Kirkland from[[8.08]](/frasier/transcripts/season_8/episode_8/mary_christmas.html "Mary Christmas") Mary Christmas._]
    
      **Kelly:** We'll be right back, to see how our teams are doing in the 
             first week of our Fat to Fit Weight Loss Challenge, so stay 
             right here.
    
    _Kelly samples something from a spoon the chef offers.  The KACL team 
    is to the side, wearing shorts and corporate T-shirts._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, look, it's them.
    
    _The KPXY team are all wearing golden training robes._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, those robes!  It makes them look like they're in some kind 
             of cult.
       **Noel:** Like the high priests of Asmodeus the Destroyer. [_off their 
             looks_] Asmodeus - demon of lusts, eater of worlds.  Does nobody 
             read my e-mails?
      **Kelly:** Welcome back.  So let's see how our teams fared this week.  
             Come on in, guys!  Come on in!
    
    _Frasier notices a large, balding man on the KPXY team._
    
    **Frasier:** Kenny, who's that last guy on their team?
      **Kenny:** Oh, uh, Wayne Shafter.  He's their new general manager.
    **Frasier:**[_deep and ominous_] So...we meet again, Wayne Shafter.
      **Kenny:** You know him?
    **Frasier:** We went to high school together.  He was the captain of the 
             football team - Mr. Popularity - and my chief rival for the 
             affections of our Swedish exchange student Giselle Johannson-
             Janson.
      **Kenny:** Yeah, so, uh, how'd that work out?
    **Frasier:** Great.  We got married and had six kids.  What do you think?
    
    _Kenny walks away.  Frasier decides to make the first contact._
    
    **Frasier:** Wayne Shafter?
      **Wayne:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** Frasier Crane.
      **Wayne:** Hey, F. Hockey! [_He laughs and shakes Frasier's hand._] What 
             have you been up to?
    **Frasier:** Oh, you know, not much.  Harvard, Oxford, M.D., Ph. D., and 
             then just recently, I...
      **Wayne:** Hey, remember that time I took your chess set and made you 
             cry?
    **Frasier:** You did not make me cry.  I chose to cry as a tactic to elicit 
             sympathy and thereby regain my chess set.
      **Wayne:**[_scoffing_] I threw it in the dumpster behind the cafeteria, 
             didn't I?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.  It was never found.
      **Wayne:** No, I did.
      **Kelly:**[_who has been talking in the background_] And last up for KACL, 
             my old friend, Dr. Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Kelly! [_He gives her a friendly embrace._]
      **Kelly:** Hey, Fras, good to see you, get up.
    
    _He steps onto the scale._
    
      **Kelly:** Ouch!  One pound heavier, Fras.
    
    _KPXY cheers quietly._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that can't be, I've added a salad to every meal.
    
    _Bulldog and the rest of the team glare at him._
    
      **Kelly:** So, at the end of one week, it's KPXY down 17 pounds, KACL 
             down 9.  That's all the time we have.  Join me tomorrow when 
             my guests will be the Senior Citizens' Handbell Chorus.  Have 
             a neat day!
    
    _Kelly gives a sunny wave, and the teams join her._
    
    **Frasier:**[_pleading his case to his team_] Listen.  Muscle weighs more 
             than fat, you know, and the way I've been working out 
             lately...
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, save it, lard-ass.
    
    _The team begins to exit.  Wayne calls after Frasier._
    
      **Wayne:** Hey, you know, Crane, when they say "Take one for the team," 
             they don't mean another cruller. [_He laughs._]
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up, Shafter, you're a cruller.
      **Wayne:** Oh, give it up.  I'll drop you a postcard from Vegas.
    **Frasier:** I'll tell you what, we are going to win this competition, 
             Mister.  And when we do, you will replace that chess set.
      **Wayne:** Okay, deal.  But if we win, you're showing up at our station 
             in your little field hockey uniform.
    **Frasier:** You're on, you fat scoundrel.
      **Wayne:** All right, shake on it.
    
    _Wayne offers his hand.  Frasier goes to take it, and he pulls it 
    away._
    
      **Wayne:** Psych!  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, that wasn't cool.  Here you go.
    
    _Frasier falls for it again, and Wayne again pulls back his hand._
    
      **Wayne:** Psych!
    
    _Frasier begins to exit._
    
      **Wayne:** Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, it's not a deal unless we shake 
             on it.  Come on.
    
    _Frasier's look says "I'm not falling for it again."_
    
      **Wayne:** Come on.  I wouldn't do it for a third time. [_He smiles._]
    **Frasier:** All right.
    
    _The hand is again pulled back when Frasier reaches for it._
    
      **Wayne:** Psych!  God, I missed you!
    
    _He laughs heartily.  FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT I
    
    ACT II
    
    Scene 4 - Frasier's apartment
    Niles and Daphne enter.  Niles has a whiplash brace on his neck._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, Martin!
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad!
    
    _Martin rises from his chair and takes in Niles's brace._
    
      **Niles:** How's Barney doing?
     **Martin:** Oh, he's doing a lot better today.
      **Niles:** Great.  I brought him a treat.  Millet and sunflower kernels 
             with added calcium for beak conditioning. [_Daphne goes toward 
             the kitchen._]
     **Martin:** Mmm.  What happened to your neck?
      **Niles:** Oh... [_He gives a sidelong glance at Daphne._] Fell out of bed.
     **Daphne:** He's been so accident-prone lately.  Every morning it's 
             something else.
    
    _She goes into the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** Shamu jump the tank again?
      **Niles:** Fortunately, I moisturized right before bed, so I squirted out 
             like a watermelon seed.
    
    _Frasier enters in a track suit, very winded._
    
     **Martin:** You all right, son?
    **Frasier:** Walked upstairs.
      **Niles:** Why did you walk upstairs?
    **Frasier:** Burning calories.
    
    _He begins to do calisthenics against the table behind the couch._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes, I saw you on TV.  You know, that Kelly Kirkland is 
             quite an actress.  I once saw her in a production of _Love 
             Letters_ with Bill Nye, the Science Guy. [_indicating_] Tears.
    
    _A beat as they take that in._
    
    **Frasier:** I've decided to rededicate myself to this diet.  The opposing 
             team is captained by my old high school nemesis, Wayne 
             Shafter.
      **Niles:**[_gasps, then_] Which one was he?
    **Frasier:** Thick neck, dead eyes... snapped your PBS umbrella.
    
    _Niles grimaces._
    
    **Frasier:** For the next two weeks, I shall be a speed-walking, calorie-
             burning, pound-shedding machine.  Daphne, didn't you purchase 
             some sort of stomach-tightening apparatus for Dad?
     **Daphne:** The Ab Blaster or the Flab Buster?
    **Frasier:** Right.  I'll tell you what.  Bring me both of them.  I'll put 
             them together, see if I can get a real good workout going.
    
    _He notices Niles and Martin caring for Barney._
    
    **Frasier:** So... is that bird nesting in my cashmere scarf?
     **Martin:** Yeah, we tried a whole bunch of them.  That's the one he likes 
             best.
    **Frasier:** All right, that's it.  I want that sky rat out of here.
     **Martin:** Oh, no!  Eddie will be crushed.  The bird's like his pet.
    **Frasier:** Eddie _is_ a pet.  He doesn't get to have a pet.
    
    _Frasier exits toward his bedroom._
    
      **Niles:**[_petting the bird_] Well, I guess Barney has pretty well 
             recovered. 
     **Martin:**[_wistfully_] Yeah, I guess.  Well, time to go, Barney.  Oh, 
             Eddie, don't worry.  He'll come back and visit you.
      **Niles:** It's kind of hard letting him go.  
    
    _They exit to the balcony._
    
      **Niles:** Now I know how you must have felt all those times when you 
             dropped me off at musical theater camp.  Sad and frightened...
    
    _He goes out the door, Martin lingers._
    
     **Martin:**[_with a meaningful pause_] Lots of emotions, son.
    
    _He follows Niles onto the balcony._
    
      **Niles:** Barney, remember us fondly as you spread your wings and soar 
             free.
    
    _Niles shuts his eyes and throws the bird upward.  Martin's eyes and 
    head follow the bird as he drops like a rock._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, my God!  Barney!
      **Niles:**[_searching the skies_] Where did he go?  Is he soaring free?
     **Martin:** He bounced off the railing, and landed on the Cunninghams' 
             balcony.
      **Niles:** Dad, look!  His wing just moved!  He's alive!
     **Martin:** I'll go get him.
      **Niles:** Hurry, hurry!
    
    _Martin goes back inside._
    
      **Niles:**[_yelling down_] Don't you die!  I love you, you tough old bird! 
             [_then_] Not you, Mrs. Cunningham.
    
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 5 - KACL
    Kenny is in the booth.  Bulldog enters.  Both of them are edgy._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, what did I tell you about smoking in the booth?
    
    _Roz enters from the studio holding a cigarette._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, bite me.  I need something to kill my appetite -besides 
             your STUPID, UGLY FACE!!
    
    _Bulldog backs off._
    
      **Kenny:** Gotcha, Bulldog.
    
    _Bulldog pinches Kenny's nipple, hard._
    
      **Kenny:** Ow!  What did I tell you about that?
    
    [_N.B. In fact, David Hyde Pierce is the only member of the regular 
    cast who does not smoke.  He also insists that Jane Leeves not have 
    a cigarette before any scene that requires him to kiss her._]
    
    _Gil enters._
    
        **Gil:** Thieves!  Brigands!  I had three-and-a-half ounces of sashimi-
             grade ahi in the fridge and one of you has stolen it.
    **Bulldog:** Not me.
        **Roz:** Well, it wasn't me!  And it wasn't Noel.  He thinks I'm going 
             to do him in Vegas, so he's barely eaten in two weeks. [_She 
             laughs._] That's why he keeps fainting.
    
    _They all stare at Kenny.  Roz drags her cigarette._
    
      **Kenny:** All right, I took it and I liked it!  What are you going to do 
             about it? [_Bulldog pinches his nipple again._] Ow!  It wasn't 
             even your fish! [_Bulldog pinches his other nipple._] OW!
    
    _Unseen before, Noel now rises from the floor, bumping his head on the 
    desk._
    
       **Noel:** How long was I out that time?
        **Roz:**[_suggestively_] Ten minutes, big boy.
       **Noel:** I've got a bump the size of an egg.
      **Kenny:** Don't say "egg."
       **Noel:** Don't tell me what to say.
        **Gil:** I'm still waiting for my ahi.
        **Roz:** Put a sock in it, Princess.
        **Gil:** How dare you?
        **Roz:** How dare you!
    **Bulldog:** Should I crack the egg, Noel, huh?
    
    _They all begin to scream at each other at once.  Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** People!  People, STOP IT!
    
    _They are silent._
    
    **Frasier:** Now, listen, I understand that we're all a bit cranky...
        **Gil:** Cranky?  We're starving.  I'm not sure I can hold on much 
             longer.
    **Frasier:** We've only got one day more to go.  We can't crack now when 
             we're this close to victory!  All right, everyone - take a deep 
             breath.
    
    _They all inhale.  Roz begins to hack in an obvious smokers' cough._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, Roz, cough it all up.  We don't want any extra phlegm 
    weight.
    
    _A crowd outside the studio begins to sing "Happy Birthday."_
    
       **Noel:** Whose birthday is it?
      **Kenny:** Gina in accounting.
        **Roz:** Who's Gina again?
    **Bulldog:** New chick.  So-so face, a little big in the can.
        **Gil:** Perhaps I'll go wish dear Gina well. 
    **Bulldog:** Hey, good idea.
    
    _They all agree._
    
    **Frasier:** Now, that's the team spirit!  We may be dieting, but we can 
             still nourish ourselves on some good office fellowship.  
             Please give Gina my regards
             as well.
    **Bulldog:** Okay, Doc, see ya.
    
    _They all say good-bye to Frasier and exit the booth._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to himself_] Oh, it's a good team... Good people...
    
    _Behind him, they all race past the window._
    
    **Frasier:**[_realizing_] Good God!  [_calling and running after them_] Wait!  
             It's not worth it!  It's sheetcake!
    
    _FADE TO:_
    
    **BYE BYE BIRDIE**
    
    _Scene 6 - Frasier's apartment
    The team are all there.  Bulldog is wearing a loud silver jumpsuit and 
    doing rapid step exercises, up and down the little step.  Gil is seated 
    on the couch, Kenny is in Martin's chair, Roz is smoking near the 
    balcony window._
    
        **Gil:** Will you stop that infernal bouncing?
    **Bulldog:** No, sir.  No, sir.  Gotta keep moving.  Constant movement 
             equals constant calorie burn.  You sure you guys don't want 
             some appetite suppressants?
    
    _Bulldog stops briefly and gulps down several pills from a bottle._
    
        **Roz:** What the hell are those things anyway?
    **Bulldog:**[_over-stimulated_] They're fine, they're fine, they're natural, 
             they have ginseng.
    
    _He takes another shot of them, and begins to do stair exercises again.  
    Frasier is standing in front of the door and is bumped when Niles and 
    Martin try to enter._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on in, Dad.
    
    _Martin and Niles enter, Niles carrying a bag._
    
     **Martin:** What's going on?
    **Frasier:** Well, we had a bit of a discipline breakdown.  We've all 
             agreed to spend the last twelve hours before the final weigh-
             in policing each other.  It's a good thing you had dinner out.  
             I've purged the apartment of all foodstuffs.
      **Niles:** Who's that gentleman on the floor?
        **All:** Noel.
    **Frasier:** He passes out from time to time, but not to worry, I'm sure 
             the next searing stomach cramp will bring him around.
    
    _Noel rises from in front of the fireplace with a loud groan._
    
    **Frasier:**[_patting Noel on the back_] There you are.  You can set your 
             watch by him.  All right, everybody.  I believe my bathroom 
             has probably finished its transformation into a steam room by 
             now.  If you'll all join me, we can relax and sweat off a few 
             extra ounces.
    **Bulldog:**[_excitedly_] Okay, you heard the doc, let's go, let's go, let's 
             go.
    
    _Frasier leads them all back, Bulldog shepherding them from the rear.  
    He slaps Noel's head as they go.  Niles and Martin approach the box on 
    the bookcase containing the bird._
    
      **Niles:**[_opening the box_] Hey, Barney.  How's my favorite patient?
    
    _Niles reaches a hand in._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, making progress.  He doesn't even flinch anymore at the 
             sound of your voice.
      **Niles:** He's letting me stroke his wing.  You know what?  I'm going to 
             put this birdseed in a bowl.
    
    _Niles goes back to the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:**[_to the bird_] Oh, you know, there's a sad little fellow who's 
             been dying to say hello to you all day.
    
    _He places the box on the floor next to Eddie._
    
     **Martin:** That's better.  Eddie, come on, say hello.
    
    _Eddie rapaciously sticks his head in the box and grabs the bird._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, my God, Eddie!  Eddie!
    
    _Eddie runs into the hallway carrying Barney in his jaws._
    
      **Niles:**[_o.s._] Hey, Dad?
     **Martin:** Oh, no.
    
    _He grabs the box and places it back on the bookshelf, closing the lid._
    
      **Niles:**[_coming out of the kitchen with a bowl_] I've been thinking.  
             You know...
     **Martin:**[_shushing him_] Shh.  Keep it quiet.  That wing rub you gave 
             him put him right to sleep.
      **Niles:** Well, that's kind of sweet.  Well, uh, I'll just go home.
    
    _He sets down the bowl of birdseed._
    
      **Niles:** You know, Dad, I think he may like me even more than he likes 
             Eddie.
     **Martin:**[_with simultaneous irony and truth_] No contest.
    
    _Niles exits.  Martin heads back.  
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene 7 - Frasier's bathroom
    The room is filled with steam.  The "team" are all there, only visible 
    as an odd arm and leg here and there.  Bulldog is still wearing his 
    jumpsuit, Roz is wearing a robe, and the other men are wearing towels._
    
    **Bulldog:** How much longer, Doc?
    **Frasier:** Another half an hour.
        **Roz:** I can't keep my cigarette lit.
    
    _Noel's voice comes from the floor, indicating he is lying down._
    
       **Noel:**[_weakly_] Roz, take my hand.
        **Roz:** Fine, Noel, I'll take your stupid hand. 
    
    _She gets up and fumbles around._
    
        **Roz:** Where are you...?
        **Gil:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Oh, my God!  Put on a towel, you perv.
        **Gil:** If I had known this sort of thing went on in steam rooms, I'd 
             never have let you lure me in.
    **Frasier:** All right, just relax, team.  Feel the steam literally melting 
             the pounds away.
    
    _A moment of silence._
    
      **Kenny:** Oh, I'm about to faint.  I'm going to grab some water. 
    
    _He exits._
    
    **Bulldog:** You sure you want to leave him alone out there?  He could be 
             on his way to Pizza Hut.
    **Frasier:** Good point.  I'll just go check on him. 
    
    _He exits.  By now everyone is practically invisible._
    
        **Roz:** It's weird, my skin tastes kind of salty.
    
    _Beat._
    
    **Bulldog:** Oh, I'd say mostly sweet, but a little salty.  Heh, heh, heh.
        **Roz:** That wasn't me, Bulldog.
        **Gil:** That was me you licked.  And if it happens again, I shall 
             consider it strike one.
    
    _CUT TO: Kenny walking toward the kitchen wearing a robe.  On the way he 
    sees the birdseed and samples it._
    
      **Kenny:** Mmm.
    
    _He walks back to the kitchen.  Frasier follows, belting his robe.  
    On the way, he observes the bird's feathers on the floor.  He picks 
    one up and releases it, horrified.  
    
    He opens the bird's box, sees the bird is gone, and jumps back.  
    
    Kenny enters from the kitchen, licking his finger and picking his 
    teeth.  Frasier eyes him with suspicion and shock.  Kenny looks 
    guilty._
    
    **Frasier:** Kenny... what did you just eat?
      **Kenny:**[_sucking his teeth_] Nothing.
    **Frasier:** You have a toothpick!
      **Kenny:** Oh, all right, I couldn't take it anymore.  I only had a 
             mouthful.
    **Frasier:**[_screaming_] Dear God!
    
    _The rest of the team rushes in.  Noel and Gil are now wearing robes,
    and Gil -- this kills me -- has a pink towel wrapped turban-style around
    his head._
    
    **Bulldog:** What happened?
    **Frasier:** This ravenous madman's just eaten a live pigeon!
      **Kenny:** No, I didn't!  I only had some seeds.
        **Gil:** If Kenny gets seeds, we all get seeds.
        **Roz:** Where are they?
    **Bulldog:** No, get away!  I saw them first!
    
    _They all rush toward the birdseed and struggle for it._
    
        **Roz:** No, give me those!
    
    _The bowl goes flying and scatters birdseed all over the floor.
    They clamber over Martin's chair, diving for the birdseed._
    
    **Frasier:** Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop this madness!  Look at yourselves!
    
    _They stop and look up.  Roz's hair is completely messed up._
    
    **Frasier:** Dear God, we are hours away from victory and look at you, 
             plucking around the floor like a clutch of crazed capons.  
             Try to conjure up some image to give us strength.  Imagine 
             yourselves winning.  Imagine yourselves in Vegas!
        **Roz:**[_whining_] I'm still hungry!
    
    _Martin enters from the hallway._
    
     **Martin:** Stay out of the hallway, Eddie just threw up a dead pigeon, 
             and now he's eating it again.
    
    _Martin exits.  They all rise saying such things as "Okay, that's it," 
    and "That'll do it for me."  Kenny spits out the seed residue in his 
    mouth.

    Scene 8 - Channel 6 Studio
    Kelly Kirkland introduces the segment._
    
      **Kelly:** Next up, the final weigh-in in our Fat to Fit Weight Loss 
             Challenge, so stay right here.
    
    _The team are in their KACL T-shirts._
    
    **Frasier:** Okay.  Everybody take off your watches, jewelry, hairpins, 
             shoes, anything that'll add just an ounce of weight.
    
    _The other team, led by Shafter, enters in their robes._
    
      **Wayne:** Hey, Crane!  Looking forward to seeing you in your field 
             hockey skirt.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah?  I'm going to be so busy playing with that new chess 
             set you're gonna buy me that I won't even have time to put on 
             my skirt... Not that I still have it!
      **Kelly:** Welcome back!  And here they are, come on in folks!  KPXY, 
             you're up first.
    
    _The KPXY team is weighed.  Instead of a one-person scale, for the 
    final weigh-in they've prepared a trampoline-sized scale for the whole 
    team, with a big electronic display._
    
    **Bulldog:** Okay, guys.  Huddle up, here's the plan.  I'll stand in the 
             middle.  You surround me, and lift me up, so I'm not even 
             touching the scale.
    
    _They stare at him._
    
    **Bulldog:** What?
    
    _The scale dings._
    
      **Kelly:** Wow, you have lost an impressive 44 pounds, 2 ounces.  Great 
             job, guys!
    
    _The KPXY team congratulates each other._
    
       **Noel:**[_delirious_] I see giant steaks with legs.
    **Bulldog:** You're hallucinating. [_He slaps Noel's head._] Just pull it 
             together.
      **Kenny:** Uh, no, he's right.  It's the Beef Council Dancers.  They're 
             on after us.
    
    _Noel slaps Bulldog's head._
    
      **Kelly:** Okay, Team KACL, up you go.
    
    _They mount the scale.  It dings._
    
      **Kelly:** Oh, my goodness!  44 pounds even.  You lose by two ounces!
    
    _They all begin to groan._
    
        **Roz:** No!  I'm not getting emphysema for this.
    
    _She reaches for her purse and grabs a pair of scissors, handing it to 
    Gil.  She then lifts her ponytail._
    
        **Roz:** Cut me!
        **Gil:** I can't!
        **Roz:** Cut me, damn it!
    
    _Gil grimaces as he does so.  Roz puts down her ponytail and the 
    scissors.  The scale now changes to 44 lb. 3 oz._
    
      **Kelly:** Oh, my God!  44 pounds, 3 ounces!  They're on their way to 
             Vegas!
    
    _The KACL team cheers (as does the studio audience).  The KPXY team 
    reacts with disgust, and appear to want to cry foul.  The KACL team 
    goes off to the side_
    
      **Kelly:** Don't go away!  When we come back, we have a little dance 
             number that's both "rare" and "well done."
    
    _She smiles broadly.  The show fades out to music.  Shafter approaches 
    Frasier._
    
      **Wayne:** Okay, Crane, you won.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I did, Shafter.
      **Wayne:** So, where do I pick up this chess set?
    **Frasier:** The Rook Nook.  Ask for Cyril.  Tell him you were sent by Dr. 
             Frasier Crane...
    
    _Frasier holds out his hand for Wayne to shake.  He takes the bait._
    
    **Frasier:** PSYCH...
    
    _He pulls his hand back as Wayne goes to shake it._
    
    **Frasier:**...iatrist.
    
    _The KACL team cheers, giving Frasier hugs and high-fives.  
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    _END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    The team is enjoying a small feast from a side table in the television 
    studio.  They all exit together, except for Noel, who indicates that he 
    will follow.  Roz is the last to leave.  Noel rushes back to the scale 
    area and picks up the lock of Roz's hair.  He sniffs it lovingly, and 
    tucks it inside his shirt, whereupon he rushes back in the direction 
    the team left.
