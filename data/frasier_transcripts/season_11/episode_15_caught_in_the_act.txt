## The Return of Nanny Gee...

    
    
    
    Nanette "Nanny G" Gooseman is a character that sometimes eludes even 
    the most ardent fans of _Frasier_ or _Cheers_ -- probably owing to the 
    fact that she has appeared on each show exactly once.  She is Frasier's 
    first wife.  He married her long before he met Lilith, or even before 
    he was engaged to Diane Chambers.  A hippie in youth, she became a 
    Raffi-like children's entertainer.  On the _Cheers_ episode 
    "One Hugs, The Other Doesn't," she was played by Emma Thompson.  She 
    appeared on _Frasier_ (in her youthful incarnation) played by Dina 
    Waters, in [[9.02]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_2/don_juan_in_hell_2.html "Don Juan in Hell \[2\]") "Don Juan In Hell[2]."
    
    In fact, there was a rumour that Emma Thompson originally agreed to 
    replay the part for this episode, but was forced to cancel - ironically, 
    because she cited "nanny problems."
    
    Frasier also refers obliquely to his first, failed marriage in [[5.13]](/frasier/transcripts/season_5/episode_13/the_maris_counselor.html "The Maris Counselor") 
    "The Maris Counselor" and [[7.02]](/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_2/father_of_the_bride.html "Father Of The Bride") "Father of the Bride."

    _ACT ONE
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa -- Morning
    Frasier is seated at a table.  Martin comes in, extremely full of 
    himself.
    _
     **Martin:** Large coffee to go, please. [_with heavy innuendo_] Black. 
             [_sits with Frasier_] Whew, didn't get much sleep last night 
             at Ronee's.  Don't ask why, �cause there are certain things 
             a gentlemen doesn't tell.
    **Frasier:**[_hoping he'll shut up_] Ah.
    _Martin crosses his arms with a smug, expectant grin on his face.  
    Frasier refuses to take the hint.  Martin lets out a naughty
    chuckle._
    **Frasier:** Dad, please?
     **Martin:** Well, all right, I'll tell you just a little.  She's got this 
             massage oil-
    **Frasier:** Would you stop it!  I do not want to hear about your dirty 
             weekend -- especially since the most erotic experience I've 
             had in six months was last week's trouser fitting.
    _Niles enters with a GAP shopping bag.  He seems taken aback to see 
    Frasier and Martin there._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
     **Martin:** Hi, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hi.
    **Frasier:** The GAP, Niles? I didn't know you shopped there.
      **Niles:** I just discovered it.  Apparently there are a number of them.
    _He sits down._
    **Frasier:**[_suspicious_] And what did you get there?
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, well, let's see... some wine glasses, and a bud vase-
    **Frasier:** That's Pottery Barn, you jackass!  Give me that!
    _Frasier snatches the shopping bag and pulls out a white cashmere sweater._
    **Frasier:** Just as I thought. You bought the Diego sweater.
     **Martin:** Well, what's the big deal?  It's just a sweater.
    **Frasier:** It is not "just a sweater," it is a work of art by Spain's 
             fabled master weaver Diego -- who uses only the soft chin hairs 
             of Andalusian mountain goats.  Our sweater man could only get 
             one this year.  Niles and I made a pact that neither of us 
             would buy it. [_to Niles_] You can't even keep a simple sweater 
             pact!
     **Martin:** Ah, Ronee -- now there's a gal who can keep a sweater "packed!"
    **Frasier:** Stop that! [_to Niles_] The least you can do is let me borrow it 
             sometime.
      **Niles:** Absolutely not!  You know Diego's weave conforms precisely to 
             the contours of one's body.  Five minutes on you, I'd never be 
             able to wear it again.  
    _Daphne enters._
    [_N.B. Jane Leeves is still wearing her maternity prop._]
    
     **Daphne:** Hello!
    _The three Crane men ad-lib hellos, and Daphne turns to the counter._
      **Niles:**[_lowers voice_] Not a word about this.  We're saving money for 
             the baby's college fund.  She'd kill me if she found out I 
             spent half a semester on a sweater.
    _Martin gets up as the waiter brings his coffee and Daphne comes back._
     **Martin:** You want this?  I'm leaving.
     **Daphne:** Where have you been?  You missed your massage this weekend.
     **Martin:**[_smug grin_] That's what she thinks.
    **Frasier:** Just go!
    _Martin leaves, and Frasier and Niles invite Daphne to sit._
      **Niles:**[_to the waiter_] Can I get a coffee? [_to Daphne_] No biscotti?
     **Daphne:** No.  I baked me own.  I decided a dollar-fifty was way too 
             much to spend on a cookie.  Anyone?
    _She takes a plastic bag of cookies out of her purse.  Her words have 
    given Frasier a wicked idea._
      **Niles:**[_nervous_] Oh, thank you, my angel of thrift.
    _Roz enters, looking exhausted and depressed.  They ad-lib hellos._
      **Niles:** Good morning!
        **Roz:** Yeah, maybe yours was.  I just spent the last two hours 
             waiting in line for this kiddie performer that Alice loves -- 
             Nanny Gee [_Niles and Frasier's ears prick up_] - and the second 
             I got to the window the show sold out.
      **Niles:** Nanny Gee?  Frasier might be able to pull a few strings for 
             you there. [_Frasier chuckles_]
        **Roz:** Do you know Nanny Gee?  What, did you like date her?
    **Frasier:** Actually, I married her.
        **Roz:** You married Nanny Gee?
    **Frasier:** Yeah well, briefly.  It was years ago.  I was a callow,  
             dreamy-eyed youth, and she was...
        **Roz:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I need tickets!  She's at Kid Books right 
             now, signing her new CD.  If you come with me...
    **Frasier:** Well, all right, all right, I'll see what I can do.
    _Roz drags Frasier to the door.  A waiter brings Niles's coffee._
      **Niles:** Thank you.  
     **Daphne:** Oh, and could you turn the heat up in here?  It's freezing.
    **Frasier:**[_as he's leaving_] Oh, Niles has a sweater.
    _To Niles's horror, Daphne reaches for the shopping bag and pulls out 
    the Diego._
     **Daphne:** Oh, and it's from the Gap -- good boy!  Now help me stretch the 
             neck out, I don't want to muss me hair.
    _Niles stares aghast as she gives the collar a hard tug and stretches it 
    wide open.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE**
    _Scene Two -- Kid Books
    A long line of parents are standing with their children.  Nanny Gee, 
    a woman in her early 40's wearing a brightly-colored costume and beret, 
    is signing books and CDs at a table.
    _
       **Girl:**[_getting her CD_] Thank you, Nanny Gee!
    _She walks back, passing Frasier, Roz, and Alice._
        **Roz:** So what was it like being married to Nanny Gee?
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh... we were so young and immature.  We had huge fights 
             over nothing.  But in the bedroom...
        **Roz:** Frasier! 
    **Frasier:** Sorry.
    _But despite the setting, Roz still wants to know._
        **Roz:**[_glances around_] So, uh, Nanny Gee gave you nice "hugs"?
    **Frasier:** Oh, big hugs.  
        **Roz:**[_chuckling_] No kidding.
    **Frasier:** We used to hug our brains out.  In fact, you know, the last 
             time we saw each other she wanted to have a little reunion hug, 
             but alas, I was still married to Lilith and settling for my 
             weekly handshake.
    
    [_N.B. The "Cheers" episode on which Nanny Gee appeared was entitled 
    "One Hugs, The Other Doesn't."  Also, a slight discontinuity here: in[[9.02]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_2/don_juan_in_hell_2.html "Don Juan in Hell \[2\]") "Don Juan In Hell[_2_], Nanette confessed that she made a lot of 
    distracting noises._]
    
        **Roz:** So, are you hoping for another hug?
    **Frasier:** Mmm?  Well, the thought had crossed my mind.  You know, 
             we used to have this wild attraction to each other -- it was 
             almost combustible!  Truth be told, it's been a while since,  
             I, uh... [_covers Alice's ears_] romped with abandon through 
             the perfumed gardens of Eros.
        **Roz:** Next time you say something like that, cover my ears.
    _They reach Nanny._
    **Nanette:**[_eyes on Alice_] And who's this for?
    **Frasier:** Frasier.  F-R-A-
    **Nanette:**[_looks up_] Frasier!  Oh, it's so good to see you again!
    **Frasier:**[_shakes her hand_] Nanette, hi.
    **Nanette:**[_to Roz_] And you, you look great!  I've never such color in 
             your cheeks...
    **Frasier:** Oh, this isn't Lilith.  This is my co-worker, Roz, and her 
             daughter, Alice. 
    **Nanette:**[_to Alice_] Hey, Alice.  How old are you?
    **Frasier:** I'm divorced now.
      **Alice:** Five.
    **Nanette:** Wow, five!
    **Frasier:** Single again.
    **Nanette:** You know what happens when you turn six?  You grow an extra 
             finger! [_Alice laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Footloose, fancy-free...!
        **Roz:** She's not biting.  Just get the tickets.
    **Frasier:** All right.  You know, Nanette, Alice was so hoping to see your 
             show.  But alas, all the tickets are sold.
    **Nanette:** Well, I think I can scare up three seats -- if you don't mind 
             sitting in the front row.
    _Alice jumps for joy, making Roz do the same._
        **Roz:** Oh, thank you, Nanny Gee!
    _Nanette's assistant, Donald, comes over._
     **Donald:** Can I have everyone's attention?  Nanny Gee has to go to the 
             theater now.  So... no more autographs.
       **Kids:** Ohh...
    **Nanette:** Gosh, I'm sorry.  But maybe we may have time for one more 
             thing.  Would you like to hear a song?
       **Kids:** Yeah!
    **Nanette:** Does everyone know the Peek-A-Boo Song?
       **Kids:** Yeah!
    **Nanette:** Well, then you know what to do!
    _Donald goes to a piano in the corner and plays the tune._
    **Nanette:**[_covers her eyes, singing_] Peek-A-Boo...
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo!
    **Nanette:** Peek-A-Boo...
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo!
    **Nanette:** Someone's there, but oh my gosh, I don't know who!
             Is it you?
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo!
    **Nanette:** Give a clue!
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo!
    **Nanette:** Guess I'd better go and sneak a Peek-a-Boo! [_uncovers her 
             eyes_]
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo!
    _Everyone laughs and applauds._
    **Nanette:** That was great!  And now it's your turn to sing back to me, 
             so I want everyone to cover their eyes!
    _All the kids do so._
    **Nanette:** Ah-ah!  I said everyone!
    _Frasier, chuckling, covers his eyes, as do Roz and all the adults.  
    Donald plays the tune again.  The kids start to sing..._
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo...
    **Nanette:** Peek-A-Boo!
       **Kids:** Peek-A-Boo...
    **Nanette:** Peek-A-Boo!
    _With that she turns and gooses Frasier.  As he uncovers his eyes in 
    shock, she grabs him and kisses him lustily._
       **Kids:** Someone's there, but oh my gosh, I don't know who!
             Is it you?
    **Nanette:**[_past his lips_] Peek-A-Boo!
       **Kids:** Give a clue!
    **Nanette:** Peek-A-Boo!
    _They break apart, and lest he confuse the meaning of everything she's 
    already done, she does a seductive grind while tugging at her breasts._
       **Kids:** Guess I'd better go and sneak a Peek-a-Boo!
    **Nanette:** Peek-A-Boo!
    _They uncover their eyes and everyone applauds, Frasier most 
    enthusiastically of all._
    **Frasier:** One more time!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Apartment
    Niles is waiting.  Martin is in his chair.  Frasier comes in with a 
    cake box.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, you guys.  I'm glad you're both here.  Guess who's 
             coming by for a drink -- Nanette Gooseman.
      **Niles:** Nanny Gee!
     **Martin:** I don't suppose she's bringing her checkbook.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God, Dad, will you let it go?
     **Martin:** I was still paying for that wedding six months after you two 
             divorced!  Nannette didn't have any family, so she got off 
             scot-free.
      **Niles:** Oh yeah, orphans get all the breaks. 
    
    [__N.B. A second discontinuity here -- according to [[9.02]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_2/don_juan_in_hell_2.html "Don Juan in Hell \[2\]") "Father of 
    the Bride," Frasier's first wedding was a quick affair dashed off 
    at city hall, presumably by a justice of the peace.__]
    
      **Niles:** Hey, Frasier, Dad and Ronee are joining us for dinner,
             why don't you two come along?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, Niles, I'm planning a bit of an intimate 
             evening myself.
      **Niles:** Really?
    **Frasier:** She wants me!
     **Martin:** Are you sure?  You said that last week about the cable lady, 
             and she just had something in her eye.
    **Frasier:** She hit on me in the children's bookstore -- where I bought her 
             CD. Trust me, the woman is a sexual volcano just waiting to 
             erupt!
      **Niles:**[_examining the CD_] Judging from some of these song titles, you 
             may be right.  "Nanny's Messy Bed," "I Feel Something Great 
             Inside Me," "Bannisters are Fun"...
    _Daphne enters with Eddie._
     **Daphne:** Hey. [_they ad-lib hellos_]
      **Niles:** My sweater -- weren't you wearing it when you went out?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, but Eddie was pulling me along so fast, I started sweating 
             like a blacksmith.  I could smell the lamb curry I had for lunch 
             just wafting out my pores.  But don't worry, it's right here.
    _She opens her purse, where the sweater is bunched into a ball.  
    She notices something._
     **Daphne:** Oh, great! [_extracts a cookie_] That was me last butterscotch, 
             now it's all fuzzy!
    _Niles is about to cry.  The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** That'll be Nanette!
    _He dashes over and opens the door to Nanette, wearing an evening dress.
    She grabs him again._
    **Frasier:** Nanette!
    **Nanette:** God, I could throw you down on this floor right now and... 
             [_sees the rest_] Hi!
    **Frasier:** Here, let me take your wrap.
     **Daphne:**[_aside to Martin_] Isn't she the children's entertainer?
     **Martin:** Yeah, SpongeBob Hotpants.
    _Frasier hangs up Nanette's wrap._
    **Frasier:** Nanette, you remember my dad, of course, and Niles, and this 
             is his wife, Daphne.
    _Nanette hugs Martin, then shakes hands with Daphne._
     **Daphne:** Hello, it's nice to meet you.
    **Nanette:** Oh, it's nice to meet you too. [_hugs Niles_] And oh, I don't 
             think I've seen you since the wedding!
     **Martin:** Oh, I remember that day.  All those nice friends of yours 
             came.  What was it - sixty, seventy?
    **Frasier:** Yes, okay, Dad.
     **Martin:** I know, because, only fifty RSVP'd.
    **Frasier:** It's all right.  You know, sadly, this bunch is going out this 
             evening, so it'll be just the two of us.
    _Donald knocks and sticks his head in._
     **Donald:** Hey!
    **Nanette:** And Donald.
    **Frasier:** Donald?
     **Donald:** Hey, put her there -- Don Burwell.
    **Frasier:**[_shaking hands_] Frasier Crane, uh...
    **Nanette:** Donald, here, does - well, just about everything for me.  
             He's my manager, producer, songwriter, publicist-
     **Donald:** Husband.
    **Nanette:** I was getting there.  And when I told him where I was going, 
             well he just had to come along to meet you.
    **Frasier:** Well, uh... gosh, who wants wine?  I know I do!
    **Nanette:** I'll help! [_follows him_] Donald, introduce yourself!
    _Reset to: Kitchen
    Frasier storms in, followed by Nannette._
    **Frasier:** And just when were you planning on telling me you have a 
             husband?
    **Nanette:** He produces my show, it's a marriage of convenience.
    **Frasier:** Well, at the moment it's not!
    **Nanette:** Come on, give Nanny some sugar!
    _She grabs him again._
    **Frasier:** Stop-stop it, stop it!  Donald will see us.
    **Nanette:** Well, say that you're short on something and send him to the 
             store.  He's good at errands!
    **Frasier:** I'm not going to send him on an errand.  He's your husband!
    **Nanette:** It's just business.  It's nothing compared to what we had. 
             [_fondling his chest_] Do you remember the passion... and the 
             wildness?
    **Frasier:**[_weakens_] Well, we are running low on cornichons...
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Donald is standing with his back to the kitchen, telling the rest about
    their recent tour.  Over his shoulder, all Martin, Niles and Daphne see 
    is Frasier and Nanette in a clinch against the refrigerator._
     **Donald:** Not only did we break house records in Boise and Topeka, but 
             she hasn't missed a show.  She just, she lives to entertain 
             children.
      **Niles:** Of all ages.  Don, come out and look at the balcony.
    _Niles hurriedly steers Donald onto the balcony.
    
    Reset to: Kitchen
    Frasier pushes her away._
    **Frasier:** Dear God!  Have we lost our minds?
    **Nanette:** Frasier, if you knew how bored I am, being "Nanny Gee." [_pours 
             herself a big glass of wine_] How trapped I feel...
    **Frasier:** You have a wonderful career.
    **Nanette:** But nothing ever changes!  Do you have any idea what it's like 
             to play the same character for twenty years?
    
    [_N.B. An inside joke here -- 2004 is Kelsey Grammer's twentieth year in 
    the role of Frasier Crane.  This line got the biggest laugh from the 
    studio audience, who had been told this in advance._]
    
    **Frasier:** But... you've brought joy to countless small children.
    **Nanette:** Yeah, well, there are times you want to bring joy to somebody 
             big enough to throw a little back at you.
    _She grabs him again, he pushes her away and carries out the tray of 
    wine glasses.
    
    Reset to: Living Room_
    **Frasier:** Who wants wine?
     **Daphne:**[_sotto voce_] Oh, that'll cool her right down.
      **Niles:** Uh, none for us, we really have to go.
     **Martin:**[_getting up as Donald reenters_] Yeah.  Uh, nice to meet you, 
             Donald.  And, uh, Fras, see you in a few hours.
     **Donald:**[_cheerfully_] So, looks like a threesome tonight.
     **Martin:** Maybe I'll just stay at Ronee's.
    _Martin, Daphne, and Niles exit.  Frasier and Nanette stand uneasily 
    with glasses of wine._
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, uh... here we all are.
    _Donald's cell phone rings -- it is set to the tune of "The Peek-A-Boo 
    Song."  Nanette looks like she wants to scream.  Frasier sits on 
    the couch and takes a big sip of his wine.
    _
     **Donald:** Hello?  Ar-are you sure? [_to the others_] Mr. Bunny's using 
             again. [_into phone_] Do you have anyone to replace him?
    **Nanette:** Donald, we are guests here!  Take that outside.
    _Donald does._
    **Nanette:** Honestly, the man has no manners.
    _She jumps on Frasier._
    **Frasier:**[_forces her away_] Cut that out!
    **Nanette:** Oh, I can't help myself.  I've never stopped thinking about you.
    **Frasier:** Nor I you, but this is wrong.
    **Nanette:** Oh Frasier, you're so good.  You always do the right thing.  
             I have the exact same problem.
    **Frasier:** Well, you're making great strides overcoming it.
    **Nanette:**[_checks the balcony_] Well, I'm tired of being good. [_sits up_] 
             I've sung my songs and cheered people up. [_lifts her glass_] 
             Haven't I earned the right to be a little bad?  Isn't there a 
             part of you that wants to be bad?
    **Frasier:** Yes, and three guesses which one.  I-I... I can't do it.
    **Nanette:** Come to my dressing room after the show tomorrow.  I have an 
             hour when Donald's busy.  I know an hour's not much...
    **Frasier:**[_overcome_] Trust me, an hour's more than ample.
    _She shushes him as Donald comes back in._
     **Donald:** Well, I just hope he shows up tomorrow.  That bunny suit is 
             just so darn tight on me.
    _Frasier gets up and crosses to the dining table, where he takes a tray 
    of pastries out of the cake box._
    **Frasier:** Donald, you know, you really must try one of these Gruyere  
             tarts.
     **Donald:** Oh, no thanks.  I'm watching the old cholesterol.
    **Nanette:** So am I -- but you know what?  I just feel like being bad 
             tonight. [_takes one_] What about you, Frasier?  Are you going 
             to be bad?
    _Frasier hesitates.  Donald takes the dish and holds it up._
     **Donald:** Ah, go on -- what's one little tart?
    _Frasier and Nanette eat their tarts, exchanging a complicitous smile.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Niles is at the window seat.  Frasier rushes in.
    _
    **Frasier:** Niles-
      **Niles:** Well, it shows its face.  What was that last night?
    **Frasier:** Relax, relax, nothing happened.  My problem now is that she's 
             invited me to her dressing room for an... _apr�s_ -show tryst.
      **Niles:** You're not going?
    **Frasier:** Well...
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Niles, if you had any idea how much pain she's in.  The woman 
             is reaching out to me to rescue her from a loveless marriage, 
             from-from a career she feels trapped in.  If I could help her 
             make a new beginning, wouldn't it be heartless of me to deny 
             myself to her?
      **Niles:**...Did you say something?  Your penis was talking so loud 
             I couldn't hear.
    **Frasier:** All right!  I want her and she wants me!
      **Niles:** She's-married.
    **Frasier:** Well, I married her first!  "Till death us do part," as I 
             recall!  Now you may not take those vows seriously, but I do.
      **Niles:** Will you listen to yourself?
    **Frasier:** Oh, this is more than just sex, Niles!  This is passion, 
             _kismet_!  A gift the gods bestow on only a chosen few.  
             Wouldn't the real sin be to refuse it?
      **Niles:** Isn't that your old second-piece-of-pie argument?
    **Frasier:** Well, maybe it is, _but I haven't had "pie" in six months!_
      **Niles:** Frasier, you can rationalize this any way you want.  But the 
             question is, if you do this, can you live with yourself 
             afterwards?
    _As Frasier considers that, Alice runs in, followed by Roz._
        **Roz:** Ready for the concert?
      **Niles:**[_rising_] Hey, Alice.
      **Alice:** Hi, Uncle Niles!
    _She gives him a big hug, making him laugh.  Seeing Frasier, she grabs 
    Roz and drags her out again._
      **Alice:** Come on, Mommy, let's go!
        **Roz:** Oh, oh, oh -- no hugs for Frasier?
    _As Roz is dragged out, Frasier slowly rises._
    **Frasier:**[_sadly_] No... no hugs for Frasier.
    _FADE TO:_
    **BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG PROBLEM**
    _Scene Five -- Theater Backstage
    Frasier knocks on a dressing room door.  The star says, "Nanny G."
    Nanette opens the door, dressed in her costume.
    _
    **Nanette:** Frasier, I thought you were coming after the show.
    **Frasier:** No, I can't.
    **Nanette:** Well, we have ten minutes, let me just get rid of- [_yells into 
             the room_] Donald!
     **Donald:**[_o.s._] Huh?
    **Frasier:** No, no. I can't do this at all.
    **Nanette:** What?
     **Donald:**[_o.s._] Huh?
    **Nanette:**[_into room_] Nothing, just sit there!
    _She steps into the hall and closes the door behind her._
    **Frasier:** God knows I'm tempted, but this is wrong.  I-I'm sorry you've 
             been so unhappy in your life lately, but... if you want to 
             talk, we can meet later, at the coffee shop next door.
    **Nanette:** Well, why can't we talk now?
    **Frasier:** Don't you have a show to do?
    **Nanette:** They can't start without me.  Here, come with me.
    _Scene Six -- Prop Room
    Nanette leads Frasier down some stairs to a room full of sets and props.  
    In the center is a king-sized bed draped with bright, playful covers.
    _
    **Frasier:** What is this place?
    **Nanette:** It's the prop room.  This is where I come before every show to 
             fight off the emptiness and the nausea that comes over me. 
    _She sinks onto a chair and cuddles a teddy bear._
    **Nanette:** You don't know how many times I've sat down here, curled up in 
             a ball, vomiting like a wino. [_chokes back a sob_] Hold me, 
             Frasier.
    **Frasier:**[_tempted again, but_] I can't.  You're married.  And these 
             shoes are suede.  Look, I-I realize that you're at a 
             crossroads right now, and if I can help you reach a 
             decision...
    **Nanette:**[_gets up_] I can't go on.
    **Frasier:** Then don't.  Make a break, redefine yourself-
    **Nanette:** No, I mean now.  This show, I can't go on.
    **Frasier:** What?  Cancel?
    **Nanette:** I can't go out there and sing and dance and pretend to be a 
             happy lady when the love of my life has just rejected me.
    _Weeping, she lays face-down on the bed -- making sure to push her behind
    up into the air.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_weakening_] Oh, Nanette, I... I realize that you're upset, 
             but-but think of little Alice, and-and the children.
    **Nanette:**[_lays on her back_] Oh, let them learn now that life is filled 
             with bitter disappointments.
    **Frasier:** But, Nanette...
    _Nanette rips open the front of her costume, exposing her neglig ee.
    _
    **Nanette:** Oh, make me a happy lady, Frasier.  And then I can go on.
    **Frasier:** For the children!
    _He jumps on her.  They embrace passionately for a moment, then Frasier 
    breaks away and quickly undresses._
    **Nanette:**[_helping him_] I'll get the belt...
    _CUT TO: Theater
    Alice and Roz are sitting eagerly in the front row.  Roz looks down the 
    aisle for Frasier, then checks her watch.
    
    CUT TO: Prop Room
    Frasier is down to his boxers, as Nanette lays back on the bed._
    **Nanette:** Take me, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Yes!  Yes!
    _He jumps on her, and she pulls the bedspread over them._
    **Nanette:** Oh!  Oh God!  How I've dreamed of this moment!  Have you?
    **Frasier:** Are you kidding? [_reaches down, pulls off his boxers, and 
             flings them away_] I dreamed of it twice last night!
    _They start necking passionately... then the ceiling opens above them 
    and the bed starts to rise on a hydraulic lift._
    **Nanette:** Oh my God!
    **Frasier:** Already?
    **Nanette:**[_pushes him off her_] Oh, no!  I thought we had more time!  
             Quick, get off the bed!
    _P.O.V. Looking down through the opening as the bed rises toward the 
    light, as Frasier and Nanette scramble:_
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!  Why is the ceiling opening up?!
    **Nanette:** This is how I make my entrance! [_re-buttoning her costume_] GET 
             OFF THE BED!
    **Frasier:** I can't, I can't!  I'm tangled in the sheets!
    **Nanette:** Oh, my God!  Jump!
    **Frasier:** Jump?  It's too high!
    **Nanette:** Aim for your clothes!
    **Frasier:**[_realizing_] Dear God, my clothes!
    **Nanette:** Oh, hide!  For God's sake, just hide!
    _They both duck under the covers._
    [_N.B. All of the following scenes were shot earlier at the Bogart Theater 
    in Los Angeles.  The audience was shown the scenes on the monitors, to 
    record the laugh track.  In fact, the audience laughed so loud the volume 
    had to be decreased for the broadcast just so the action could be heard._]
    _As the bed rises into a playful bedroom set, the orchestra strikes up, 
    and the audience cheers, waving "NANNY G" pennants.
    
    Under the covers:_
    **Nanette:** You have got to get out of this bed!
    **Frasier:** Can't I just hide here until the show's over?
    **Nanette:** Trust me, that ain't gonna work.
    _Finished re-buttoning her costume, she sits up, with a big smile 
    on her face.  The audience applauds, and as the orchestra starts 
    the first number, she stretches her arms over her head and yawns.  
    A rooster crows._
    **Nanette:**[_singing_] When it's time to rise, I yawn and rub my eyes,
             because I'm such a sleepyhead
             But rise I do, �Cause I'm dying to see what's new
             In Nanny's messy bed
    _Frasier risks lifting the covers enough to see out, and quickly ducks down 
    again when he sees the whole audience in plain view._
    **Nanette:** There might be treats, Last week I found a pizza
             And a chimpanzee named Fred
             [_gets out and starts dancing_]
             So kids, what say, we see what we find today
             in Nanny's messy bed?
    _Four actors wearing animal costumes enter from behind the bed and jump on it -- 
    and Frasier -- before jumping down to the stage to dance.
    _
    **Nanette:** There's always something new
             It's Mr. Kangaroo!
    **Bunnies:** Some bunny rabbits, too!
      **Panda:** And a Panda!
    _Instrumental.  As Nanette and the animals dance around the bed, 
    Frasier peeks out and whispers to the nearest one._
    **Frasier:** Psst!  Panda!
      **Panda:**[_keeps dancing_] Who the hell are you?
    **Frasier:** Dr. Frasier Crane, a noted psychiatrist.  When does the bed 
             go back to the basement?
      **Panda:** A new set comes on, the bed flies out to the rafters -- fast.
    _Nanette stands on the bed and lifts the cover over herself -- seeing Frasier 
    but keeping him covered from the audience.
    _
        **All:** What a mess!  
             What a mess!  
             What a messy, messy, messy, messy bad!
             What a mess! 
             Nonetheless...
    **Nanette:** With all the time I spend in it, it's nice to have a friend in  
             it!
    _She peeks under the cover._
    **Frasier:** You have got to get me out of here.  The thing's about to fly 
             up to the rafters!
    **Nanette:** Gee, I didn't know that, having only done this show 12,000 
             times!
    _As the others continue singing, she ducks under the covers and pulls 
    something out of the front of her costume._
    **Nanette:** Put this on.
    **Frasier:** You can't be serious!
    **Nanette:** Just put it on now!
    _She comes back up as the others finish singing._
     **Actors:** Messy bed...
    _They finish.  The audience applauds._
     **Nanette:** Oh, hi boys and girls!
    **Audience:**[_including Roz and Alice_] Hi, Nanny Gee!
     **Nanette:** Well, I guess I guess I'd better make my bed!
    **Kangaroo:** You don't have to, Nanny Gee!  I have a magic wand that can 
              make it fly away until it's nighttime again! [_waves the wand_] 
              Al-a-ka-
     **Nanette:** WAIT! I think there's something in there that I haven't found 
              yet! [_looks and gasps_] It's the best surprise ever -- it's a 
              new baby brother!
    _She flips the sheet up, revealing Frasier wearing nothing but an oversized 
    comedy diaper and baby bonnet.
    
    The audience roars with laughter.  Alice puts a hand to her mouth, giggling.  
    Roz just stares._
     **Nanette:** Oh, what's the matter, little guy?  You look kind of sad.  
              Are you going to cry? [_urges him with her eyes_]
     **Frasier:** Waaaa!
     **Nanette:** Oh, sounds like somebody could use some cheering up.  
              Let's sing him the "Hoppity-Hop" song.
    **Kangaroo:**[_under his breath_] We cut "Hoppity-Hop" in Detroit.
     **Nanette:**[_through her teeth_] Well, put it back in!
    _The orchestra master changes his sheet music, and begins.  The animals 
    form up._
    **Nanette:**[_singing_] When I'm blue, just like you
             When it's not my day
             I hop, hop, hoppity-hop
             Hop my troubles away
             [_to Frasier_] Come on!
    _Nanette and the animals dance around the bed.  Frasier has no choice 
    but to get off the bed and do the same._
        **All:** When a bee stings my knee
             When I lose a toy
             I hop, hop, hoppity-hop
             and soon I'm jumping for joy!
    _Frasier struggles madly to ape their choreography and lip-sync 
    the words, darting glances at Nanette and the others.  Roz looks 
    incredulous._
        **All:** We were feeling sad
             Now we're feeling snappy
             We were hopping mad
             Now we're hopping happy!
    
             So when you think people stink
             Let your knees just bend
             And hop, hop, hoppity-hop
             and watch your grumpiness end!
    _As they reach stage left, Frasier tries to slip offstage, but runs 
    headlong into Donald, who is staring at him, enraged.  Frasier can
    only continue back across the stage, dancing in a line with Nanette
    and the animals._
        **All:** Hop, hop, hoppity-hop
             and soon you'll make a new friend...
    _Roz puts a hand over her eyes.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    The actors are sitting around a table in the prop room, smoking and
    playing cards.  Donald comes down the stairs, and asks where to find
    Frasier.  They say they don't know.  Irritated by the smoke, Donald
    quickly leaves.  Frasier emerges from behind a prop chest, dressed.
    He thanks the gang, and they send him on his way.
