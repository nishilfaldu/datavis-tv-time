    [N.B. The transcript has not been divided cleanly in half, owing to
    the extended length of the U.S. broadcast version.  So, Acts One 
    and Five have been transcribed by Nick Hartley, and Acts Two, Three 
    and Four by Mike Lee.]
    
    **Skyline:** A rainbow arcs out of the building line and touches the 
    first letter of the title.
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- An Airplane Cabin
    A rather pensive Frasier Crane is sitting on a plane, looking out of 
    the window. It would seem the plane is going through some turbulence - 
    a jolt of which is especially felt by Anne, the young lady in black 
    sitting next to him._
    
    **Frasier:**[_calmly_] You all right?
    _Anne takes a deep sigh and turns to him, still pressing herself into 
    the seat._
       **Anne:**[_embarrassed smile_] I hate flying.
    **Frasier:** Just a little turbulence, we'll be through it in a minute.
    
    _Another jolt makes Frasier doubt his words._
    
    **Frasier:** Mother of God!
       **Anne:** This is so embarrassing.  I mean, I treat people for this. 
             I'm a psychiatrist.
    **Frasier:** Well, there's a small world, I'm a psychiatrist too. 
             [_putting out his hand:_] Dr. Frasier Crane.
       **Anne:** Ooh, I've heard your show. [_returning the handshake:_] Dr. 
             Anne Ranberg.
    
    [_N.B. Anne Ranberg is a blend of the names of two previous Frasier 
    writers; Anne Flett-Giordano and Chuck Ranberg._]
    
    **Frasier:** Lovely to meet you.
       **Anne:** Nice to meet you.  Now, don't let me interrupt you.  You 
             seemed kinda deep in thought.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I suppose I was.  It's been a rather eventful three 
             weeks for me.
       **Anne:** Well, if you want to talk about it, it might get our minds 
             off the flight.
    **Frasier:** It's really rather personal... It's nothing you'd be 
             interested in.
       **Anne:**[_accepting_] Okay, then.
    _They sit back comfortably into silence but after another jolt of 
    turbulence..._
    **Frasier:** So I was dating this woman...
       **Anne:** Mmm-hmm...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Bedroom
    The scene takes us back with Frasier's story.  Frasier and Charlotte 
    are wrapped in each other's arms in his bed.  They look perfectly 
    serene._
    
    **Charlotte:**[_drowsily_] Weren't we on our way to lunch?
      **Frasier:** Yes, but then you followed me in here when I came to get 
               my briefcase and uttered the fatal phrase that no man can 
               resist.
    **Charlotte:**[_laughing_] I said I liked your pillow shams.
      **Frasier:** Nice try, my little temptress, but I'm down for at least 
               an hour.
    **Charlotte:**[_laughs and caresses his face_] Do you still have time for 
               lunch before work?
      **Frasier:** Well, my show doesn't start till two, and it's only...
    _Frasier looks at the clock to see how many more Frasier hours 
    Charlotte will be able to clock up._
    
    **Frasier:**[_jumps up in bed_] Oh dear God!
    
    _It is two o'clock.
    
    SMASH CUT TO: Radio Station
    Roz is stressing on the phone as an even more anxious Kenny bursts 
    in._
      **Kenny:** Where the hell is he?
        **Roz:** I don't know. [_hanging up_] I called his cell, I called his 
             house... You're going to have to go on for him.
      **Kenny:** Me?!
        **Roz:** Yeah, you -- well, I'm not.  Last time I did it, it was a 
             total disaster! 
    
    [_N.B. An obvious reference to[[10.02]](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_2/enemy_at_the_gate.html "Enemy At The Gate") "Enemy at the Gate," when an 
    overconfident Roz took over Frasier's show, and ended up letting
    slip over the air that she and Frasier had slept together._]
    
        **Roz:** Aren't you always saying you used to be a DJ?
      **Kenny:** Oh, twenty years ago, I can't do that anymore!
        **Roz:** Well, it better come back to you, you've got five seconds.
    
    _Roz pushes him into the presenter's booth._
    
      **Kenny:** I can't!  I'm a nervous wreck!  My palms are sweaty, my 
             mouth is like cotton...
    _Roz directs him to the microphone and instantly Kenny becomes a 
    hideous D.J. monster with a voice sounding like the voice-over 
    narrator on movie trailers after a bad dose of helium._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, Emerald City, Kenny Daly heerrre!  Master of the Mike, 
             Baron of the Booth, the Man of the Hour, too sweet to be 
             sourrrr! [_puts on headphones_] The doctor's ouuuut today, 
             but Kenny's heerrre - filling the seat, takin' the heat!  
             I might even throw in a call or two to Grandma Gert. 
             [_typical old lady's voice:_] But no kids, I hate kids! 
             [_back to the voice of D.J. Daly Hell_] Whoo-hoo, she's in 
             a mood today!
    _Kenny looks up at an unbelieving Roz.  However, he fails to translate 
    the signals being made by her boggling eyes, and just grins.
    
    CUT TO: Frasier's Bedroom
    Meanwhile, back in the bedroom... Charlotte is listening to Kenny's 
    ramblings as Frasier dresses in the bathroom._
    
      **Kenny:**[_v.o. from the radio:_] Who's this coming into the booth?  
             Why, it's Percy Von Snootenheim! 
    **Frasier:**[_o.s. from the bathroom_] Turn that off!
    _Charlotte complies as Frasier comes out of the bathroom dressed for 
    work._
      **Frasier:** I'm sorry I have to rush off.  I wish we could spend the 
               whole day together. [_leans in to kiss Charlotte_]
    **Charlotte:** I don't leave for Chicago until midnight.  I'll, I'll 
               come over and make you dinner.
      **Frasier:** Oh that sounds great, I'd love that.
    
    _They touch hands and then part._
    
    **Charlotte:** Any requests?
      **Frasier:** Uh... I liked what I had for lunch.
    **Charlotte:**[_blushing_] Why don't I just surprise you?
      **Frasier:** Still sounding like lunch. 
    _He laughs and leans in to kiss her again.
    
    CUT TO: Radio Station
    Back in the studio, Roz's mind begins to shut down as she listens 
    to Kenny embarrass himself further.  He is sat with his feet on the 
    console, and the microphone in his hands._
    
      **Kenny:** Isn't that a great song, people?  Really brings back the 
             memories.  Sorry I kinda forgot the words there in the 
             middle.  So let's toss it to the news! [_clicks a button 
             with vigor_]
    
    _Frasier sneakily enters from the producer's door._
    
        **Roz:** Where the hell have you been?
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I am sorry.  I had a doctor's appointment, it 
             couldn't be helped!
    _Frasier enters the presenter's booth and relieves Kenny of his 
    duties._
      **Kenny:** Just in time, Doc.  This turned out to be one of your 
             better shows.
    **Frasier:** Well thank you, Kenny.
    _Frasier sits in worry to find his angst rising when an old friend 
    suddenly appears in the booth.  Behold, the return of Special Agent 
    Bebe Glazer -- licensed to make you a star!_
    
       **Bebe:** Darling!
    **Frasier:** Bebe?!  What are you doing here?
       **Bebe:**[_flinging her arms around him_] I just came by to see my 
             favorite client, [_kisses him on the cheek, then turns to 
             Kenny_] and the wonderful man who's giving him such a 
             happy, happy home.
      **Kenny:** Ah, you're the best, Bebe!
    _Bebe smiles as she shuts the door on him, and then in a heartbeat 
    turns to Frasier and says:_
    
       **Bebe:** Good news, I'm busting you out of this hellhole!
    **Frasier:** What?!
       **Bebe:** Did you ever hear of Dr. Mark Reisman?
    
    [_N.B. Mark Reisman is a reference to a man of the same name who 
    previously worked on "Frasier" as a producer._]
    
    **Frasier:** The San Francisco radio psychiatrist?  Yes, we had a nice 
             encounter once at a conference.
       **Bebe:** Well, last week he had a not-so-nice encounter with a 
             falling air conditioner. 
    _She sticks her tongue out and gestures to her throat as if to slit 
    it._
       **Bebe:** Anyway, they want you to replace him and the money's huge!
    **Frasier:** Poor Mark... what a ghastly way to die!
       **Bebe:** Yes, I cried so hard it was all I could do to stuff your 
             demo tape in the Fed-Ex pouch.  But they want you!
    **Frasier:** Well, it's very tempting, Bebe, but I'm very happy here in 
             Seattle.  I don't want to leave.
       **Bebe:** Darling, it's San Francisco!  Do you know what life is like 
             there for a good-looking straight man?  You'll be like a 
             Snickers bar at a fat camp!
    _She knows just what to say to tempt him mightily.  He considers it 
    for a moment, then..._
    **Frasier:**[_resisting the Bebe temptation_] Uhhh... No.  My answer is 
             still no, Bebe.  I've got to begin my show. [_sits down_]
    
    _Bebe heads to the door and to the next stage of her plea._
    
       **Bebe:** Well, that's gratitude for ya!  Do you have any idea the 
             lengths I went to to make this happen? [_opens the door_]
    **Frasier:** Wait a minute.  You were in San Francisco last week.  Don't 
             tell me...!
       **Bebe:** I was nowhere near that air conditioner. [_teasing:_] You're 
             worse than the police.
    _Bebe giggles like the Devil and leaves Dr. Faust-ier without his 
    soul.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **THE GULFS MAY WASH
    US DOWN**
    
    _Scene Three -- Frasier's Apartment - Kitchen
    We are presented with a visual image of Charlotte's opening line:
    her cooking at the stove, Frasier behind her with his arm wrapped 
    around her waist, nuzzling her affectionately.
    _
    **Charlotte:** We are such a cliche!  Little woman at the stove, big 
               rugged man with his brawny arm...
      **Frasier:** Oh, the hollandaise is breaking!
    _As she turns her attention to the imperilled sauce, Frasier removes 
    his brawny arm and enters the living room, carrying a bottle of 
    wine.  
    
    Reset to: Living Room
    The table is set for two.  Martin, dressed in his suit, enters from 
    his bedroom._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, I thought you were going out with Niles and Daphne?
     **Martin:** I'm waiting on Ronee.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, Charlotte is leaving for Chicago in three hours.  
             This is our farewell dinner.
    
    _Charlotte enters, carrying two plates._
    
    **Charlotte:** Oh, hi Martin.
       **Martin:** Oh, hi, how are ya?  Don't worry, we're leaving.  I'm not 
               going to spoil your romantic mood. [_shouts down the 
               hallway:_] Hey, Ronee, what, did you fall in?!
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** Good heavens, I thought that you were meeting them 
             downstairs.
     **Martin:**[_heading to the door_] That's what I thought too.
    
    _Martin opens the door to find a befuddled Kenny Daly._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, Martin.  Oh, thank God you're home, Doc.  I'm going a  
             little crazy, I need some advice.
    **Frasier:**[_trying to excuse him_] Kenny, we just put dinner on the 
             table.
      **Kenny:** Oh thanks but I'm too worked up to eat.  Doing your show 
             today, I... I got the fever! I want to get back behind the 
             mike.  But should I quit my job, throw away my whole career 
             and financial security just to chase some cock-a-mamie 
             dream?!
    **Frasier:**[_with a big smile_] Yes!  Off you go!
      **Kenny:** You didn't even have to think about it!  You always 
             believed in me, Doc!
    _Kenny throws his arms around Frasier in a zealous hug.  He suddenly 
    spots Charlotte and, whilst still hugging Frasier, holds out his 
    hand._
    
        **Kenny:** Hi.  Kenny Daly.
    **Charlotte:**[_shakes hand_] Hi, nice to meet you.
      **Frasier:** This is Charlotte.  
        **Kenny:**[_welling up_] I'm getting all messy here.  Let me just pop 
               into the powder room real fast.
    _Kenny leaves to the powder room as Martin shouts back down the 
    hallway._
     **Martin:** Ronee!  While we're young!
      **Ronee:**[_enters_] Too late! [_to Frasier_] Well, have a great evening, 
             you two.
    **Frasier:** Yes, thank you.  Bye.
      **Ronee:** Oh damn it, my contact slipped, hang on.
    
    _Ronee opens the powder room door._
    
      **Kenny:**[_o.s. from the bathroom_] Whoa!
      **Ronee:** Whoa yourself. [_closes door_] Do we know him?
    _The front door opens revealing the terrible twosome... nearly 
    threesome._
      **Niles:** Knock-knock.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake!
      **Niles:** Now, I know it's your special night but my very pregnant 
             wife insisted we come up.
     **Daphne:**[_holding up her hands, pushing her legs together_] Oh sorry, 
             won't be a minute.
    
    _Daphne goes for the powder room door._
    
        **Kenny:**[_o.s. from the bathroom_] Whoa!
       **Daphne:**[_closes the door_] Oh, sorry!  I'll just run down the 
               hall.
    **Charlotte:** Maybe I'll start over on that dinner.
    _Daphne leaves as Charlotte excuses herself to the kitchen.  Martin, 
    Niles, and Ronee, to Frasier's great frustration, sit down to wait 
    for Daphne._
    
      **Niles:** I'm sorry for intruding, but nowadays Daphne can't go ten 
             minutes... we're late for everything.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, you know how Chez Henri hates it when people are 
             Late, so I tell you what, why don't we call for that 
             elevator right now...  
    _He energetically goes to the door, urging everyone to follow him._
    **Frasier:** And tell Henri that the first round of drinks is on me!
    _Frasier opens the door to find another surprise.  A drunken 
    surprise.  Of English heritage._
    
      **Simon:** Whiskey, please!
    **Frasier:** Simon?!
      **Simon:** Oh Frasier, how are ya? [_greets Frasier with a hug_]
    **Frasier:** Please leave immediately.
    
    _Simon bellows a laugh as Daphne returns._
    
      **Simon:** Hey!  Oh, there's my little sister.  You're not so little 
             any more now, are you? [_he advances to her pregnant bump_]
     **Daphne:**[_stands back from the drunk smell_] Simon, what are you 
             doing here?
      **Simon:** Well I heard you was knocked up so I, er, brought you a 
             present.  Come on in, lads!
    _Richard E. Grant and Robbie Coltrane enter... um, sorry, I mean 
    Daphne's brothers, Michael and Stephen Moon, enter from the hallway.  
    Daphne greets them with excitement.  Frasier and Niles greet them 
    with immediate concern._
    **Michael:** Hello, sis!
     **Daphne:** Oh my God, Michael! [_hugs him_] And Stephen! [_hugs him_]
      **Simon:** We knew you'd be here when we went to your house and you 
             wasn't there.
    **Stephen:** So we took the liberty of leaving our things in your guest 
             room.
      **Niles:** How did you get in?
    **Michael:**[_mumbled, pointing at Niles_] How did we...
    _They burst out into a fit of boisterous laughter.  
    
    It should be noted that all of Michael's speech is mumbled, which 
    combined with his thick accent makes his speech very hard to 
    understand.  Think of the character of Joseph in "Wuthering Heights" 
    and move west over the Pennines.  
    
    I must say, Coltrane's attempt at the Mancunian accent is easily the 
    best seen so far on the show.  Interestingly, he is also a Scot in 
    reality, just like Brian Cox, who played Daphne's father, Harry.
    --Nick Hartley_
    
    [_N.B. Think also of Brad Pitt's character in Guy Ritchie's "Snatch."
    However, I notice that Nick is uniquely qualified to make some sense
    of it.  The American transcribers doing the closed captioning for 
    the episode simply wrote, "unintelligible gibberish." --Mike Lee_]
    
     **Daphne:** Stephen and Michael, this is my husband, Niles. [_hand 
             shakes occur_] Oh and his brother, Frasier.  And this is 
             Martin and his fiancee Ronee.  And, er, [_looking over at 
             the previous occupant of the bathroom_] sorry, your name 
             again?
      **Kenny:** Kenny.
     **Daphne:** Kenny.
    **Michael:** So, lads, I tell you what... [_mumbling_] You've a lovely 
             �ouse. [_motioning around the room_] It's come rhand thee're, 
             rhand thee're... [_mumbling unintelligibly_] he's done bloody 
             well for himself.
      **Simon:** That's right, Michael.  Frasier does very well for himself.  
             Tell you what, let's take the tour.
    **Frasier:**[_hands up_] There will be no tours!
     **Martin:** Listen, uh, why don't you guys join us for dinner?
    **Stephen:** Good, I'll lay the table. [_picks up cutlery_] Is this real 
             silver? [_attempts to bend it_]
    **Frasier:** Give me that! [_takes it off of him_]
    _Michael, meanwhile, is man-handling Frasier's Chihuly glass 
    sculpture._
    **Michael:** Oh, wow, see, platey, platey, platey... [_mumbling 
             unintelligibly_] It's a bloody great ash tray.
    **Frasier:**[_shrieks in terror_] Put that down!
    _He rushes over and takes it from him in disgust._
    [_N.B. Since the Chihuly is genuine and valued at upwards of $75,000,
    what Robbie Coltrane and Kelsey Grammer are juggling may well be a
    replica._]
    _CUT TO: Kitchen
    Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Charlotte is back cooking at the stove, 
    smiling happily - unaware that Simon is the man fondling her from 
    behind._
    **Charlotte:**[_teasing:_] You know, we could have some real fun if you 
               got rid of some of those people.
        **Simon:** Oh, just give us a minute then, love...
    _Charlotte screams and runs into the lounge.  Simon follows.

    Frasier runs over to catch Charlotte coming out._
    **Charlotte:** Who is that creep?
        **Simon:** You know, I'm getting some very mixed signals.
      **Frasier:** All right, that's it!  I want you all out of here! [_pushing 
               Simon_] And I do not mean a leisurely exit, I mean a 
               break-neck, trampling-each-other, this-theatre's-on-fire 
               stampede!
    _They all leave but Simon holds up for a second._
      **Simon:** Yeah, all right, okay, I can take a hint, Frasier!  Right.  
             Look, that's a lovely woman that you've got for yourself.  
             Congratulations.
    _He hugs Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Yes, thank you.
      **Simon:** Yeah, yeah. [_looks over Frasier's shoulder at Charlotte and 
             gestures to her_] Give us a call, I'll be at Daphne's...
    **Frasier:** Oh, get out of here!
    _Frasier pushes him out and finally slams the door on them for the 
    peace with Charlotte he desired.

    Scene Four -- Apartment, three hours later.
    Frasier and Charlotte are finishing up their final game of Scrabble.
    _
      **Frasier:** Because it's not a word.
    **Charlotte:** Yes, it is.
      **Frasier:** No, it's not.
    **Charlotte:** Yes, it is.
      **Frasier:** Use it in a sentence.  
    **Charlotte:** "Her grandmother's bed was warm and... quilty."
      **Frasier:**[_looking at another of her words_] And why is she lying 
               there?  Because she's feeling all "befevered" again?
    **Charlotte:**[_smiling sweetly_] Could I borrow your "F"? I've got a 
               little message for you.
    
    _He chuckles.  Charlotte's mobile rings.  She answers._
    
    **Charlotte:** Hello.  Okay, thanks. [_hangs up_] My car's here.
    
    _Frasier murmurs in understanding._
    
    [_N.B. In Laura Linney's recent film, "Love Actually" the trademark
    of her character was a stubborn refusal to turn her mobile off, no 
    matter how many times it rang at just the right moment to kill 
    romance._]
    
      **Frasier:** I still don't know why you won't let me drive you to the 
               airport.
    **Charlotte:** No, I can't stand all that airport goodbye stuff.  This 
               is better. [_goes to gather her belongings_]
      **Frasier:** Right.  Uh, well then...
    
    _Frasier and Charlotte walk towards each other._
    
    **Charlotte:** Let's not...  
      **Frasier:**...right.
    **Charlotte:**[_tearing up_] Because if you start...
      **Frasier:** Yeah.  Me too.  Okay.  Well then, uh, good luck in 
               Chicago.
    _Charlotte and Frasier look into each other's eyes.  Frasier is in 
    the middle of yet another goodbye.  They hug dearly._
    
    **Charlotte:** Thanks.
      **Frasier:** Got your ticket?
    **Charlotte:**[_looks in bag_] Uh, yeah.
      **Frasier:** Great, great.  Oh, oh, [_darts to set of drawers next to 
               toilet_] listen, I have a little something here for you.
    **Charlotte:** Damn it.  I knew you were going to do something sweet 
               like that.  I didn't get you anything.
      **Frasier:** It's just a hair band I found in the shower drain.
    
    _He presents the lost band to her._
    
    **Charlotte:** Thanks.
      **Frasier:** Yeah. [_chuckles_] Uh, let me get your coat. [_he does_]
    **Charlotte:** This wasn't supposed to be so hard.  
      **Frasier:**[_helping her on with her coat_] I don't know about you, 
               but I've had enough easy goodbyes.  I'm kinda glad to 
               have the chance to have another tough one.
    **Charlotte:**[_putting her hand in his_] Thank you for a great three 
               weeks.
    
    _They kiss goodbye._
    
      **Frasier:** Bye, Charlotte.
    **Charlotte:** Bye, Frasier.
    _She leaves.  Frasier looks back at his empty apartment and begins to 
    slowly walk back to the sofa.  He is stopped by a knock on the door.  
    He opens it to find Charlotte back again._
    
    **Charlotte:** Forgot my scarf!
      **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh, my fault. 
    _He tenderly winds it around her neck._
      **Frasier:** Right.
    
    _They tentatively kiss once more goodbye._
    
      **Frasier:** Bye.
    **Charlotte:** Yeah.
    _She leaves.  Frasier looks back again at his once more empty 
    apartment and begins to slowly walk back to the sofa only to 
    find another, albeit similar, interruption.  He opens the door 
    again..._
    **Charlotte:** Cell phone.
      **Frasier:** Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, here.
    _Frasier goes round the room to take the cell phone off of the table.  
    Charlotte chooses a different route.  They make a move at the same 
    times and bang their heads together._
    
         **Both:** Ow!
      **Frasier:** Sorry.
    **Charlotte:** No, it's my fault.
      **Frasier:** My word.  Ah....
    
    _They look back at each other, clutching their heads._
    
    **Charlotte:** See ya.
      **Frasier:** See ya.
    
    _She leaves.  Frasier looks back and... you know the drill._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh for God's sake, what now?
    _He opens the door and finds Charlotte open-armed.  They hug 
    passionately._
    **Charlotte:** We couldn't say goodbye on a head butt.
    
    _They kiss passionately._
    
    **Charlotte:** Feel better?
      **Frasier:** Positively quilty.
    
    _They part.  For real.

    ACT TWO_
    
    _Scene Five -- Apartment
    The next morning.  Martin opens the door to Niles, carrying a shopping 
    bag.
    _
     **Martin:** Oh hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** What are you doing here?
      **Niles:** Escaping.  I woke this morning to find Daphne's brothers 
             playing a game called "I Can Reach It From Here."  Give you 
             a hint, the "It" was a toilet.  And there were no winners.
    _They sit at the dinner table._
      **Niles:** Oh, also I stopped by to see how Frasier's holding up.
     **Martin:** Well, he was asleep when I got home, and he's still in bed.
      **Niles:** He's probably depressed.  I'm sure this whole Charlotte thing 
             has got him bereft...
     **Martin:** Ooh, shh, shh!
    _Frasier has entered -- looking rested and serene.
    _
    **Frasier:** Morning, Dad.  Hey, Niles.
    _They ad-lib greetings._
     **Martin:** Let me get you a cup of coffee. [_goes to the kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Well, I can get it.
      **Niles:**[_takes out a bag_] I brought you some of those cookies you 
             like.
    **Frasier:** Milanos!  Oh, well thank you.
    _Martin brings a tray from the kitchen._
     **Martin:** Now you just sit down, I made you a little breakfast.
    **Frasier:** I see what's going on.  You think I'm in tatters because 
             Charlotte's gone back to Chicago.  Well, I'm not. [_sits down_] 
             I'm not going to say I won't miss her like crazy.  But we knew 
             going in that our time was limited.  We made the most of it.  
             I have no regrets.
    _The door opens to admit Simon, Michael, and Stephen._
      **Simon:** Morning!
    **Frasier:** Except for leaving that door unlocked.
    _Daphne follows them in._
     **Daphne:** We thought you might like to join us for brunch.
    **Frasier:** Darn! ...Niles and I just reserved a squash court.
      **Niles:** Yes!  And we're on thin ice with the appointments director as 
             it is.  He's already moved our lockers next to the flip-flop 
             drop.
    _Simon has already flopped down onto the couch.  Daphne lowers herself
    into Martin's chair._
    **Michael:**[_mumbling unintelligibly, gesturing around the apartment_] 
             ... this whole place... [_mumbling_]
      **Simon:** That's right, Michael, Frasier has a very nice flat.  But you        
             was here last night.
    **Michael:**...Was I?
     **Daphne:** I think I need to sit down a minute before we go. [_sinks into 
             Martin's chair_] Can you believe this baby might be two weeks 
             late?
    **Stephen:**[_patting her belly_] He's a Moon, all right!  Every lad in 
             our family was at least two weeks late.  Once we get comfy, 
             nothing budges us.  Right, lads?
    **Simon/Michael:** Right!
     **Daphne:** Could I get a glass of water, please?
      **Niles:** Glass of water, yes. [_motions toward kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Right, right...
    **Michael:** Oh, Fras-or?  Be a good lad... [_mumbling, miming the shape of 
             a can with his hands_] nice big... [_mumbling_] Right, lads?
    _Stephen and Simon yell and raise their hands._
    **Michael:**[_holding up four fingers_] Three!
    _Frasier and Niles, at a loss, go into the kitchen.
    
    Reset to: Kitchen
    Frasier gets Daphne's water while Niles removes some kind of electronic 
    device from the shopping bag he's carrying._
    **Frasier:** Do you have any idea what he's saying?
      **Niles:** Not a word.  Apparently Stephen was dropped as a child.
    **Frasier:** Well, I thought the mumbler was Michael.
      **Niles:** He was dropped on Michael.  The idea that our son might take 
             after them is making me crazy!
    **Frasier:** Now Niles, just remember, those hearty Crane genes are in 
             there too.
      **Niles:** Oh, please.  Those Moon genes have probably beaten our genes 
             up and stolen their lunch money!  That is why I am taking 
             action.  I was going to wait to do this until tonight, but I 
             can see that every minute is critical.
    **Frasier:** What's this?
      **Niles:** This is called "The Born Musician."  You put this speaker on 
             the mother's stomach, and it bombards the baby with classical 
             music, thus instilling a taste for higher culture.
    **Frasier:** Huh.  Closest thing we had to that was Dad bongo-ing out 
             "Babalu" on Mom's belly.
    _They go back out.
    
    Reset to: Living Room
    Daphne is admiring a new watch on her wrist as Stephen looks on._
    **Frasier:** Here we are.
     **Daphne:** Niles, look what Stephen just gave me.  You know who'll be 
             jealous?  Mrs. Zicklin from our building.  Doesn't she have 
             one just like this?
      **Niles:**[_knowingly_] No, I don't think she does.
    _He exchanges a look with Stephen, who grins and swaggers back to
    the couch._
      **Niles:** I brought you a present too.  This plays soothing music 
             for the baby.  You put this speaker here [_places it on 
             her stomach_] just like that, and then if you want to hear 
             a selection of, say - oh, I don't know, Vivaldi? -- you turn 
             this dial, and then...
    _As Simon and Stephen sit up with interest, the baby kicks, knocking
    the speaker to the floor._
     **Daphne:** Oh, goodness!  He's never kicked like that before.
    **Stephen:** We've got a little foot-baller in there!
      **Simon:** Finally we got something we can drink to!
    **Michael:** Well, let's go to the pub!
    **Stephen/Simon:** YEAH!
    _They immediately rise and go to the door._
    **Simon/Michael/Stephen:**[_singing_] We hate Nottingham Forest, we hate 
                           Liverpool too...
                    **Simon:** And Leeds!
    **Simon/Michael/Stephen:** We hate Manchester City...
    _They exit, leaving Niles even more anxious._
     **Daphne:** Are you coming, Martin?
     **Martin:** Oh, I'm still waiting on Ronee.  We'll meet you at the 
             restaurant.
     **Daphne:** Okay.
    _Daphne exits.  Ronee enters with the cordless phone._
      **Ronee:** Marty?
     **Martin:** Hmm?
      **Ronee:** I just got off the phone with the Branford Inn.  They called 
             to confirm our wedding reservation -- for May 15th.
     **Martin:** But we're getting married July 15th.
      **Ronee:** Yes, but they have us down for May.  Apparently July 15th 
             is booked, along with every other weekend between now and 
             October.
     **Martin:** What happened?
      **Ronee:** I don't know, you made the reservation.
     **Martin:** For July 15th! [_to the boys_] Well, I love how she blames me!
    _Ronee goes into the kitchen._
     **Martin:** Why would I randomly pick a...? [_realizes_] Oh, no.
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** May 15th -- Eddie's birthday.
    _Ronee comes out of the kitchen, Martin hugs her._
      **Niles:** Well, I'm-I'm sure you can find someplace else.
     **Martin:** Oh, but we had our hearts set on the Branford Inn.  It's where 
             we had our second date.
      **Ronee:** Yeah, we had a little too much wine, and the couple at the 
             next table said "get a room," and so we did.  Oh, well, 
             guess we better start thinking about Plan B.
    _She exits._
     **Martin:** Oh, damn.  Well, I just feel sorry for Ronee.  You know, her 
             first wedding was kind of bare-boned, and that's why she had 
             her heart set on something special.  You know, a fancy menu, 
             swing band, flowers everywhere.  You need that once in your 
             life.
    _While he has been saying this, Frasier and Niles have been exchanging 
    looks with growing delight._
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad... Niles and I have been wondering what to get 
             you for your wedding, and... maybe we could just give you the 
             wedding.    
      **Niles:** You still have the Branford Inn on the 15th.
     **Martin:** But that's, that's eight days away!  You have to get a 
             caterer, a justice of the peace...
    **Frasier:** Well, I can officiate.  I still have my license from that time 
             I married those commitment-phobes on my Valentine's Day show.
      **Niles:** Are they still together?
    **Frasier:**[_raises a hand_] Not the time, Niles.
    _Ronee comes back in with her purse._
     **Martin:** Ronee, the boys think they can throw a fancy wedding together 
             by May 15th.
      **Ronee:** But that's in eight days!
    _The boys rise._
      **Niles:** Well, it only took us four days to throw together our seafood-
             themed "Friends of the Marina Bouilla-bash."
    _Frasier raises a hand, inviting applause._
      **Ronee:** Well, all right, that-that's great of you guys, thank you! 
    _Martin and Ronee head for the door._
     **Martin:** Wow, what do you know?
      **Ronee:** Yeah, leave it to the Duke and Duchess to save our behinds!
     **Martin:** Yeah...
    _Frasier and Niles stop grinning and look up._
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, leave it to whom?
      **Ronee:** What, they don't know about that one?
     **Martin:** Just keep walking.
    _They exit, leaving Frasier and Niles._
       **Both:**[_pointing_] Well, obviously you're the duchess...
    _They start arguing hotly.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE HAPPY ISLES**
    _Scene Six -- The Branford Inn
    Jazz music is heard playing.  The scene fades in on the dining room of 
    the Branford inn, which has been sumptuously prepared.  Caterers are 
    still rushing about the room.  Champagne and hors d'oeuvres have been 
    laid on a buffet table, flowers adorn the windows -- the whole nine 
    yards.
    
    As the scene fades in, Frasier, wearing a morning suit, claps his hands 
    and halts a group of dancers who have been rehearsing a swing routine.  
    The male dancers are dressed like cops, the female dancers like 
    showgirls.  The music stops.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dancers, rehearsal is over.  Please wait upstairs.  I don't 
             want anyone to see you until the floor show.
    _The dancers exit.  A guest taps on the glass door leading outside, 
    rather urgently.  Frasier runs over and cracks the door._
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, we're still setting up.
    _He closes the door in the man's face and addresses Clint, the Inn's 
    host._
    **Frasier:** Clint, would you please go outside and tell everyone they 
             can't come in here until after the ceremony.  It will spoil 
             the entire reveal.
    _Niles enters, adjusting the coat of his morning suit._
      **Niles:** You can't blame them, it's ninety degrees out there.  It's 
             dripping wet- [_realizes_] I hope our Chinese acrobats are 
             sufficiently rosined.
    _Frasier re-locks the door.  Martin and Ronee enter, casually dressed._
     **Martin:** Holy Mackerel!
      **Ronee:** You guys are amazing!
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad you like it, you two, but listen, you've gotta 
             go get changed, you're getting married in ten minutes.
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, sorry, traffic was bad.  We got stuck behind this old 
             bus.  A church group, I think.
    **Frasier:** Good, our gospel choir is here!  Niles, go make sure they're 
             fitted with their angel wings and give them all a meal 
             voucher!
    _Niles, Martin and Ronee exit.  Roz knocks on the glass._
        **Roz:** Frasier!
    _Frasier cracks the door._
    **Frasier:** Roz, I'm sorry, I can't let you in, I know it's warm out 
             there.  I'll tell you what, go have a cool drink with Kenny.
        **Roz:** I just did, he told me all about his new D.J. job.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well good for him!  I'll come down and give him a hug.
        **Roz:** Well, bring a towel, he just sweated through a hammock.  
             This sucks!  The softest boss we ever had is leaving.  
             Come on, Frasier, let me in.
    _He protests, but she pushes past him and immediately takes off her jacket._
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right, Roz.  I can't say I blame you, it's like the 
             Ninth Circle of Hell out there!
    _Bebe sweeps into the doorway._
       **Bebe:** Do you love this weather or what?
    **Frasier:** Bebe!  What are you doing here?
       **Bebe:** Your strategy worked, you genius.
    **Frasier:** What strategy?
       **Bebe:** Turning down the San Francisco job.  They've offered you 
             twenty percent more money, and thrown in a weekly TV gig 
             on the morning news.
    **Frasier:** Television... well, that certainly sounds tempting, but, but 
             my home is here!  There are more important things than money!
       **Bebe:** Yes, I know.  There's power.  But money can buy that.
    **Frasier:** Bebe!
       **Bebe:** Fine!  
    _Bebe goes back to the open door._
       **Bebe:** You don't like the terms of the deal, I'll have another swing 
             at it. [_looks out_] Did that old man just faint?
    **Frasier:** What? [_runs out beside her_] Oh, good lord!  That's my cannon 
             operator!  At the end of the ceremony, he's supposed to fire 
             that antique cannon.  I'm not sure there's anybody else who 
             knows how to work the damn thing.  Oh...
    _He shuts the door and turns back just as Niles comes running back in._
      **Niles:** Frasier...!
    **Frasier:** Niles...!
       **Both:** Disaster!
      **Niles:** Dear God, you first.
    **Frasier:** Our cannon man is down -- heatstroke.
      **Niles:** Our flower girl is down -- drunk.
    **Frasier:** The flower girl?!
      **Niles:** Apparently someone gave her champagne.
    **Frasier:** Who would give liquor to a six-year-old girl?
    _He had to ask? - Simon, Michael, and Stephen enter in their suits, 
    with cigarettes and glasses of champagne._
      **Simon:** Party's here, lads.
    **Frasier:** Simon!  Did you give our flower girl champagne?
      **Simon:** I may have. [_off Frasier's glare_] Well, the poor little thing 
             was nervous about getting her part right.
    **Michael:** Nervous.
    _Daphne enters, leading Eddie wearing a little tuxedo and a lacey 
    cushion strapped to his back._
     **Daphne:** Here's our little ring-bearer.  Ronee will be down in two 
             minutes.
    **Frasier:** Oh, great!  Still no flower girl, and now no one to fire our 
             cannon!
    **Michael:**[_looks up_] Cannon?
    _Frasier and Niles look at him, surprised._
    **Stephen:** If it's a cannon you need fired, Michael's your man.
     **Daphne:** Oh yeah, he's a great one for shooting things.  Which foot is 
             it that's missing two toes?
    **Michael:** Um... [_looks from one foot to another, then points to Simon's_] 
             That one!
    _The three brothers bellow with laughter again._
    [_N.B. Michael, of course, lost at least one toe to frostbite as a child -- 
    after his brothers rolled him across thin ice on a frozen lake.  He'd 
    be missing more if his family hadn't stopped him from sawing off the 
    rest of them.  For the full story, read [[6.19]](/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_19/iq.html "IQ") "IQ."_]
    
    **Frasier:** All right then, come along, all of you.  See if you can figure 
             out this thing.  
    _He leads Michael to the door._
    **Frasier:** Now your cue to fire it is when I say, at the end of the 
             ceremony, "ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane."  
             You got it?
    **Michael:** Right... [_mumbles unintelligibly at length_]... Boom!
    _He walks outside, leaving Frasier more uncertain than ever._
      **Niles:** Is Eddie growling?
     **Daphne:** It's his stomach.  The poor thing hasn't eaten since morning.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sakes, we can't have him rumbling up the aisle.  
             Uh, give him some of that pate over there.
    _As Daphne and Niles lead Eddie to the buffet table, Roz enters with 
    Alice._
    **Frasier:** Ooh, Roz!  Do you think that we could enlist Alice to be our 
             flower girl?
        **Roz:** What do you say, honey?
      **Alice:** Sure!
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's splendid news!  Here, here, take these rose petals.  
             [_gives her a basket_] You're supposed to strew them in the 
             aisle as you lead the procession in and out.  
      **Niles:** You know what, I guess I'd better give our ring-bearer his 
             precious cargo.
    _Frasier sends Roz and Alice outside and shouts after them as Niles 
    spoons some pate into a little dish and puts it on the floor.  Niles 
    takes the ring out and lowers it to the basket..._
    **Frasier:** Roz, her cue to lead the procession out at the end of the 
             ceremony is when I say, "ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. 
             Martin Crane!"
    _BOOM!  Screams come from the guests outside, and Frasier jumps.  
    Inside, Niles jumps higher, sending the ring flying up into the 
    air._
    **Frasier:** NOT NOW!
    _His nerves nearly shot, he closes the door, exhaling -- then from 
    outside comes the sound of tires squealing, a horn blaring, and a 
    very heavy THUD.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_Walter Matthau_] What the hell was that?!
    _He runs out of the dining room, through to another exit.  Daphne 
    notices Niles peering around the floor._
     **Daphne:** What are you looking for?
      **Niles:** The ring.  I dropped it when that cannon-
     **Daphne:**[_sees it_] It's in the pate!  Eddie, no!
    _Too late.  Eddie has scarfed the pate and swallowed the ring.
    
    Frasier runs back in._
    **Frasier:** This is just our luck!  When the gun went off, it startled 
             a truck driver, he slammed into a lamppost.  Now the entire 
             roadway is blocked!  Can anything else go wrong at this 
             wedding?
    _He looks up and sees Niles and Daphne's shifty looks._
    **Frasier:** What?
    _FADE OUT
