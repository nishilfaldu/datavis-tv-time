## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    **Skyline:** A silver dirigible floats above the skyline.
    [_N.B. This episode was originally scheduled to air February 3rd, and then
    March 23rd._]
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa
    Niles and Daphne are sitting in the window box.  Daphne gives an order 
    to the waitress.
    _
     **Daphne:** And one of those cinnamon buns, please -- extra frosting.
    _Brad and Cindy, another expecting couple, enter.  Cindy's bump is 
    very prominent._
      **Niles:** Oh, here they are.
    _They warmly greet each other, and everyone sits._
      **Cindy:** We were so excited when you guys asked us out.  You're like 
             the A-list couple in Lamaze class.
      **Niles:** Oh well, that's good to hear.  We were afraid we were in the 
             "C-section."
    _Daphne laughs (apparently she's lived under his roof long enough to 
    find that funny).
    
    Brad unpacks some plastic containers and a thermos filled with a green-
    colored smoothie._
       **Brad:** We bring our own food everywhere.  Cindy doesn't put anything 
             unhealthy in her body.  No refined sugar, white flour or 
             gluten.  I'm sure you're the same.
     **Daphne:** Oh, of course.
    _The waitress comes back with a plate._
    **Waitress:** Cinnamon bun.
      **Daphne:** Oh, no thank you, I'm pregnant.
    **Waitress:** But you said-
      **Daphne:** I said no!
    _The waitress takes it away as Cindy tucks into her food._
       **Cindy:** Sweetie, this is your best yam loaf yet. [_to Niles and 
              Daphne_] He's a saint.  He cooks my food, rubs cocoa 
              butter on my belly...
        **Brad:** I just wish I could go through the birth for her.
    _By now Niles and Daphne are both feeling extremely inadequate._
       **Brad:** Hey, what are you guys doing with your placenta?
      **Cindy:** Ours will nourish the roots of a special tree we plant in our 
             yard.
       **Brad:** Well, we live in an apartment.  Although that ficus in the 
             study is looking a tad droopy.
      **Cindy:** By the way, if you need a doula-
       **Brad:** Cindy, I'm sure they already have one.  Everybody has a doula.  
             Ours is a treasure.  She'll be there through the whole delivery.  
             Focusing our energies, giving us emotional support -- I don't 
             know how people do it without one.
      **Cindy:** She's really helped Brad.  He's having a really tough sympathy 
             pregnancy.
       **Brad:**[_rubs his stomach_] Oh, boy.
      **Cindy:** Honey?
       **Brad:** I'm just... I'm feeling a little sick again, I'm sorry.  
             I just need some air.
    _He gets up and walks outside.  Cindy gets up to follow him._
      **Cindy:** We're so in sync.  He feels everything I'm feeling: nausea, 
             weight gain, food cravings.
      **Niles:** Well, you know, in psychological terms, that's called Couvade 
             Syndrome.
      **Cindy:**[_shrugs_] We just call it love.
    _She exits._
      **Niles:** I don't like them.
     **Daphne:** They're getting so much more out of this than we are.  
             We don't even have a placenta plan!
      **Niles:** No, wait -- let's not panic.  All we need is expert help.  
             We'll hire one of those doula people.  I'll get the number 
             from Brad.
    _Brad and Cindy come back in and sit down._
       **Brad:** Sorry, sorry.  Oh, this pregnancy is taking it out of me. 
             [_rubs his nipples_] Oh, my breasts are so tender today.
      **Niles:**[_jumps on the bandwagon_] You know what?  I'm starting to feel 
             a bit nauseous.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Office Building
    The elevator doors part to reveal Frasier, with his nose buried in 
    a newspaper, and another man.  Both get off the elevator.  The man 
    continues down the hall, while Frasier walks down a few steps and, 
    with his eyes still on the paper, inserts his key into his office 
    door.
    
    Only the key doesn't fit.  Just as he looks up and realizes it is 
    the wrong door, it is pulled open by a smiling woman, Charlotte.
    _
    [_N.B. Laura Linney also voiced the guest caller Mindy in[[10.17]](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_17/kenny_on_the_couch.html "Kenny On The Couch"), 
    "Kenny on the Couch."_]
    
    **Charlotte:** Hi!  Welcome to Charlotte's Web: a matchmaking service.  
               Come in!
      **Frasier:** Well, I'm-I'm sorry, isn't this...?  Oh, I see what 
               happened.  I must have been so engrossed in my paper 
               I went right past my floor.
    **Charlotte:** Of course.  It can be a little embarrassing to admit you 
               need help in the romance department, please come in.
      **Frasier:** No, this was a mistake.
    **Charlotte:** I understand. [_more insistent_] Come in.
      **Frasier:** Trust me, you are comically incorrect.  I do not need a 
               matchmaker.
    **Charlotte:** So you're married?
      **Frasier:** No.
    **Charlotte:** Dating someone?
      **Frasier:** I date plenty.  In fact, I often need the proverbial stick 
               one uses to beat women off... with.  I... [_rallies_] I believe 
               my point is made. [_turns back to the elevator_]
    **Charlotte:**[_holds out a_] Why don't you just take my card?
      **Frasier:** I don't need your card.
    **Charlotte:** In case you change your mind.
      **Frasier:** I won't change my mind.
    **Charlotte:** For a friend.
      **Frasier:** I have no friends. [_realizes_] ...who are in need of your 
               services.  You see, I am a bit of a local celebrity, so 
               I have no trouble getting dates. [_calls the elevator_]
    **Charlotte:** Really?
      **Frasier:** Yes.
    **Charlotte:** What's your name?
      **Frasier:** Dr. Frasier Crane.
    **Charlotte:** Oh! [_then_] Sorry, doesn't ring any bells.
    _The elevator arrives.  Several passengers exit, leaving an attractive 
    young woman (Ellie).  Frasier steps on with her._
      **Ellie:** Frasier Crane?
    **Frasier:** Why, yes it is.
      **Ellie:** Well, my God, what are you doing here?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, I have an office one floor down.
      **Ellie:** Really?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Ellie:** I'm on 18.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, why don't I ride up with you?  I could use the 
             exercise.
    _They laugh.  Vindicated, Frasier waves goodbye to Charlotte._
    **Frasier:** Bye-bye.
    _The doors close.
    
    Reset to: Inside Elevator_
      **Ellie:** It's so funny seeing you here.
    **Frasier:** It's funny for you, delightful for me.  It's always nice to 
             meet a fan, especially one so attractive.
    _Beat._
      **Ellie:** You don't remember me?
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course I remember you!  It's you.  Hey, you.
      **Ellie:** I can't believe you don't remember.  We dated -- three times!
    **Frasier:**...Jennifer.
      **Ellie:** Ellie.
    **Frasier:** Ellie! [_elevator stops_] Oh well, here's your floor.  Nice 
             catching up with you.
      **Ellie:** Oh, brushing me off - that sounds familiar.
    _Reset to: Hallway
    Charlotte is waiting for the elevator.  The doors open on a scene 
    completely different from the one they closed on._
      **Ellie:** Oh, not that I'm surprised you forgot me.  You spent every day 
             talking about yourself, and then, after we slept together...
    **Frasier:**[_stumbling out_] I'm so sorry.  Sorry...
      **Ellie:** But you could've CALLED me!
    **Frasier:** Sorry!  Again, so sorry.
    _The doors close.  Frasier stands there, facing the elevator.  Charlotte 
    has kept her mouth shut and her eyes down.  They stand in silence for 
    a moment, then as one they turn back into the hallway, and he follows 
    her into her office.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **MATCH GAME**
    _Scene Three -- Office
    Frasier is pacing the office and telling Charlotte his history.
    _
      **Frasier:** And so it seems I have dated every woman in Seattle!  The 
               well is dry.  The cupboard is bare.  There are no more fish 
               in the sea.  Meanwhile my dad is engaged, my brother is 
               expecting his first child, while I am left to spin aimlessly 
               on the dating hamster wheel.
    **Charlotte:** You like your metaphors, don't you?  Well, don't worry, 
               Frasier.  Somewhere in Seattle there's a woman you haven't 
               pissed off, and I'm gonna find her.
      **Frasier:** You seem awfully sure of yourself.
    **Charlotte:** I am.  I've successfully matched hundreds of couples.  So...
    _She motions him to a chair, and sits at her desk with pen and paper._
    **Charlotte:** What kind of woman are you looking for?  And don't just say 
               smart, sexy, and sophisticated.
      **Frasier:** Why, don't you have any of those?
    _She looks at him expectantly._
      **Frasier:** All right.  Well, it's hard to say what I want.  It's been 
               so long since I've really fallen for someone.  You know that 
               feeling you get after a first date, when you can't even sleep?  
               You just lie there in bed awake, thinking about her.  That's 
               what I want.
    **Charlotte:** You're going to make me work for my money, aren't you?  
               Uh, by the way, I do require a payment up-front.
      **Frasier:** Oh, of course.
    **Charlotte:** My fee's $10,000.
      **Frasier:**[_after a beat_] That's awfully steep.
    **Charlotte:** And those ten years of bad dates, how much did they run you?
      **Frasier:**[_after another beat_] I'll write you a check.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier is having coffee with Roz.
    _
    **Frasier:** So I gave her the money and I filled out the questionnaire.
        **Roz:** Hm.  You fudged a little bit on your answers, right?
    **Frasier:** No, of course not.  Why would I?
        **Roz:** Because nobody's honest on those things.  There's a code 
             people use.  Like "mature" means old, "athletic" means flat-
             chested, and, uh... oh, "not model thin" means circus fat.
    **Frasier:** Well, gosh.  She's already sent me out on a date this evening.  
             But I assure you, I am more interested in personality than 
             looks.
        **Roz:** Did you see a photo at least?
    **Frasier:** Well, of course I saw a photo.  She's got a personality you 
             can bounce a quarter off of.
    _They share a naughty laugh._
        **Roz:** So where you taking her?
    **Frasier:** Claret - I intend to take all subsequent dates there as well.  
             That way I can compare them objectively, you see.  As the 
             woman will be the only variable.  It's basic science!
        **Roz:** Yeah, that's been your dating problem -- not enough science.
    _Frasier gives her a wry smile.  Niles and Daphne enter._
     **Daphne:** Hey, you two!
    _They ad-lib greetings.  Frasier gives up his seat to Daphne, and takes 
    another as she and Niles sit._
      **Niles:** We can only chat for a moment.  We're meeting our doula.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  Your doula.
        **Roz:** Anybody need anything?  I'm getting more coffee.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no thanks, we brought fennel tea and some healthy snacks 
             to nibble on.
    _Roz goes to the counter.  Daphne unpacks her purse._
    **Frasier:** Oh, peanut butter and carrots.  Looks like somebody has 
             pregnancy cravings.
      **Niles:** Yes, I just can't help myself. [_reaches for some_]
    **Frasier:** Oh dear, Niles -- Couvade Syndrome?
      **Niles:** We just call it love.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well... I have a date.  I've signed up with a matchmaking 
             service.
    _He rises and gets his coat._
      **Niles:** Wait, Frasier, a matchmaker?  I'm surprised you'd use a 
             professional for something as personal as your love life.
    **Frasier:** Well, I could say the same thing about you and your doula.
      **Niles:** Well, our professional comes highly recommended.
    **Frasier:** So does mine.
      **Niles:** Well, our professional is at the top of her field.
    **Frasier:** As is mine.
      **Niles:**[_while Daphne looks weary_] Well, our professional charges $200 
             an hour.
    **Frasier:** Mine charges 10,000!
      **Niles:**[_taken aback_] She sounds fantastic!  Congratulations, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Niles.  Wish me luck!
      **Niles:** Good luck. [_still impressed_] Wow.
    _Frasier exits, passing a fey woman wrapped in an afghan with her arms hugging 
    her body._
    **Harvest:**[_ethereal voice_] Daphne and Niles?
      **Niles:** Oh, you must be Harvest.
     **Daphne:** So nice to meet you. [_Roz comes back_] Oh, this is our friend 
             Roz.
        **Roz:** Hi.
    **Harvest:**[_hands to Niles_] A resume detailing my 15 years of experience, 
             plus a syllabus for further reading.
      **Niles:** Well, I am "doula impressed."
    **Harvest:** Now, on page five you'll find details about my support staff.  
             There's a masseuse, a shaman of course, and a drummer.  He 
             used to tour with the Doobie Brothers.  Very talented.
      **Niles:** My, sounds expensive.  I can't wait to tell Frasier.
    **Harvest:** And of course I insist on a drug-free birthing environment-
        **Roz:** Whoa, back up.  No drugs?
    **Harvest:** Oh, I want Daphne to be awake and connected to the moment.  
             A natural childbirth needn't be painful.
        **Roz:** It needn't be, but it be.
     **Daphne:** How painful?
        **Roz:** Would you have a tooth pulled without Novocaine?
     **Daphne:**[_afraid_] No.
        **Roz:** Well, a tooth is this big. [_measures with her fingers_]
    **Harvest:** Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you wanted to be emotionally present 
             for the birth of your baby. [_rises and takes back her papers_] 
             But I see that you just want somebody to dope you up, strap 
             you down, and yank it out.
      **Niles:**[_rises_] Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, don't go.
     **Daphne:** Yes, our friend was just leaving. [_glares at Roz_]
        **Roz:** All right. [_gets up_] You're right, I'm sorry.  This is a 
             private matter. [_strokes Daphne's head supportively_] You 
             need to do what's right for you.
    _Daphne nods, smiling -- and Roz yanks a hair out of her head.
    _
     **Daphne:** Ow!
        **Roz:** Times a million.
    _Roz walks out, as Niles rubs his temples and Daphne worriedly 
    puts a hand to her head.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **DATING GAME**
    _Scene Five -- Claret
    Frasier pulls out the chair for his date, an attractive blond.
    _
    **Frasier:** Here we are.
     **Date 1:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** There's something wonderful about first dates, isn't there? 
             [_the waiter hands them their menus_] Oh, thank you very much.
             That tingle of anticipation as two perfect strangers march 
             toward endless vistas of possibility.
     **Date 1:** Well put, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, thank you.
    
    [_N.B. Throughout the following scene(s), the camera angle switches 
    between Frasier's side of the table and his date's._]
    
    **Frasier:** And what do you do?
     **Date 1:** I'm a science teacher.
    **Frasier:** Ah, serendipity.  I'm a science man myself.  I suppose that's 
             why Charlotte got the two of us together.  Well then, what's 
             your field?
     **Date 1:** Well, my field is biology, but my specialty is creationism.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, I find that... excuse me?
     **Date 1:** You know, they're only in first grade, so they don't understand 
             everything.  But Brother William, he's our leader, he likes us 
             to get them started young before they get their minds warped by 
             all that fossil nonsense.
    
    [_N.B. For the benefit of readers in Canada or Europe, where this debate 
    is probably not as lively, or even extant: creationism is the belief 
    that takes the Book of Genesis literally, that the earth and humanity 
    were created by God in seven days, and that the earth is only as old as 
    human history - a few tens of thousands of years.  The theory deliberately 
    rebutted Charles Darwin's theories that the earth is several hundred 
    million years old, and that all species, including man, gradually 
    evolved from lesser ones.  Particularly offensive to creationists is
    Darwin's theory that humans are descended from apes.
    
    This debate was particularly heated in the American South, where several 
    states passed laws prohibiting the teaching of Darwin's theories in 
    elementary schools -- which led to the highly public "Scopes Monkey Trial" 
    in the 1930's, upon which the play "Inherit the Wind" was based.  See 
    also Frasier's reference to it in [[2.13]](/frasier/transcripts/season_2/episode_13/retirement_is_murder.html "Retirement Is Murder"), "Retirement is Murder."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I-I realize that Darwin had his detractors, 
             but to call it nonsense seems a bit cavalier, don't you think?
     **Date 1:**[_leans back_] Oh, dear.  You're one of those. [_Frasier looks 
             confused_] You think we're descended from apes?
    **Frasier:** Well, not recently, no.
     **Date 1:** Do I look like an ape to you?  Do I have hairy palms and a big 
             hairy back?
    **Frasier:** Would you like a drink?
    _SWITCH: the woman on the other side of the table is now Frasier's 
    second date -- a short brunette woman with a voice and manner as coarse
    as burlap.
    _
     **Date 2:** Oh yeah, bring it on.  But I got to warn you -- I'm a horny 
             drunk.  Last Spring in Cabo, I wake up one morning under a 
             beach umbrella, stark naked, tequila bottle in one hand, and 
             some guy's tightie-whities on my head!
    
    [_N.B. She makes Sherry Dempsey from Seasons 4 and 5 look like a 
    Victorian headmistress._]
    _Frasier's smile is frozen on his face.  The waiter happens by with a 
    long pepper mill._
     **Date 2:**[_to the mill_] Whoa!  Don't I know you from Cabo? [_braying 
             laugh_] Remind you of anything? [_laugh_] You wish, right? 
             [_laugh_]
    **Frasier:** That's, uh, very amusing.  So what do you do for a living?
    _SWITCH: Date #3_
    [_N.B. Though Frasier's lines function both as responses to his last 
    date and prompts for his next one, he's wearing a different suit
    in each take, also indicating the change._]
    _An older woman with a pageboy haircut._
     **Date 3:** Well, right now I'm back in school.  You see, I've loved 
             animals my whole life...
    _She reaches up and scratches her head, causing her hair to shift back 
    and forth and reveal a bed of stubble underneath -- it's a wig.
    _
     **Date 3:** So I figured, why not really go for it, you know?  So I'm  
             going to become a taxidermist.
    _Almost fearfully, Frasier reaches up and strokes his own thinning hair._
     **Date 3:** Is something wrong?
    **Frasier:** No.  I was just, uh, admiring your ensemble.
    _SWITCH: Date #4
    A heavyset woman with pigtails, dressed in a hideous, psychedelic 
    patchwork tunic stitched from old plaid quilts._
     **Date 4:** Thanks.  I made it myself.  You know, I have a lot of this 
             fabric left.  I could make you a shirt with a matching hat.
    **Frasier:** Don't go to any trouble.  Would you like some wine?
    _SWITCH: Date #5
    A teenager in a denim jacket, slouched back in her chair and chewing gum._
     **Date 5:** Nah, the cops took my fake I.D., and my dad'll kill me if 
             I get busted again.  So what are you, like fifty?
    _Frasier has poured himself a big glass of wine._
    **Frasier:** Something like that.
    
    [_N.B. An interesting hedge here - Frasier's birth year is given as 1952, 
    so he'd be fifty-two now.  Kelsey Grammer, on the other hand, is only 
    forty-nine._]
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Six -- Frasier's Apartment
    Niles and Daphne are seated on the couch.  Niles is snacking on 
    something.  Martin is reading the paper in his Armchair.
    
    Frasier comes out and gets his coat.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_taut singsong_] Well, I'm off.
     **Daphne:** No, you can't.  Our doula is coming specifically to meet you 
             and your father.
      **Niles:** She insists on knowing all the members of the baby's energy 
             circle.
     **Martin:** Oh, what kind of a kook is she anyway?
      **Niles:** Harvest is not a kook. [_starts rubbing his nipples_] She's 
             assisted at the birth of more than 600 babies -- and two 
             giant pandas.
    **Frasier:** Well, she better get here quickly -- I do have a date.
      **Niles:** Another one?
    **Frasier:** Yeah.
      **Niles:** You're doing fairly well by this matchmaker.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hardly. [_drops his coat_] A monkey throwing darts at the 
             Seattle phone book would find me a better mate.  Hell, a dart-
             throwing monkey would be a better mate.
     **Martin:** Why don't you fire her?
    **Frasier:** Don't think I haven't considered it.  If tonight's a bust, 
             I'm going to demand my money back.
    _Niles rises awkwardly, and walks to the dining table.  He has obviously 
    gained weight, and his bulging stomach has turned his normal arrow-
    straight walk into something unrecognizable._
    **Frasier:** Niles, have you gained weight?
      **Niles:** Yes, but you know, you always put on a lot with your first baby.  
             The hardest part is the mood swings.
    _He gets a large piece of something from the table and takes a bite.  
    The others just look at Daphne, who shrugs helplessly._
     **Martin:** Geez Niles, don't you think you're taking this sympathetic 
             pregnancy thing too far?
      **Niles:** I'm simply giving in to the primal cycle of... [_sinks down 
             onto the couch gratefully_] life.  I have no control over it.
    **Frasier:** In that case, get off my Chanel couch before your water 
             breaks.
    _He opens the door just as Harvest is about to knock on it._
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
    **Harvest:** Harvest Finkleman, delighted. [_raises her hand, but does not 
             shake his_]
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Well, I'm sorry, I can't stay.  Niles and Daphne you know 
             of course, and this is my dad.  Martin Crane, Ms. Finkleman-
             Delighted.
    _Frasier leaves._
    **Harvest:** Nice to meet you, Martin.
     **Martin:** Likewise.
    **Harvest:** So are you planning to participate in your grandchild's birth?
     **Martin:** Oh no, I'm kind of old school.  Clean the kid up, slap a bow 
             on her head, then call me in.
    **Harvest:** Oh!  Guess who had their baby -- Brad and Cindy?
      **Niles:**[_overcome, high-pitched with crying_] Oh, I'm so happy for them!
     **Daphne:** He gets very emotional lately.
    **Harvest:** It was a beautiful experience.  I made a tape if you'd like to 
             see it.
     **Martin:**[_lifting his paper_] I would like to NOT see it.
      **Niles:** No, no!  This would be good for us, play it.
    **Harvest:**[_hands the tape to Daphne_] It was an 18-hour labor.  
    _She sits cross-legged in front of the TV as Daphne puts it into the VCR.  
    The tape starts, and there is a sound of a bongo drum being played softly.
    Daphne turns to step back to the couch._
    **Harvest:** This should be about two hours into it.
      **Niles:** I'm so excited.  Daphne, I can't wait until this is us.
    _A scream of pure, hellish agony rips from the TV.  Daphne jerks around 
    to stare, Niles and Martin rear back in horror._
    **Harvest:**[_enraptured_] Oh, look at Cindy glow!
      **Cindy:**[_on TV_] Mother of God, just kill me! [_scream_]
     **Daphne:**[_nervously_] She seems like she's in a little pain. [_scream_]
    **Harvest:** Oh, pain is just fear leaving the body.
     **Martin:**[_staring at the TV_] That's a boatload of fear. [_scream_]
      **Cindy:** STOP THAT DAMN DRUM BEFORE I PUT YOUR HEAD THROUGH IT! [_scream_]
    **Harvest:** She laughed at that afterwards. [_scream_]
     **Daphne:** I've seen enough. 
    _She stops the tape, cutting off the latest scream._
    **Harvest:** Wait, wait!  You'll see how Cindy pushes through the pain.
     **Daphne:** I'm not pushing through anything.  I'm having my baby the way 
             God intended -- in a hospital, numb from the waist down.  
    _As she escorts Harvest to the door, Martin nods in approval and reaches 
    for his goldfish crackers._
     **Daphne:** Now, take your incense and your woo-woo stick and get out.
    _She shuts the door on Harvest, then turns.  Niles is rubbing his 
    nipples again._
     **Daphne:** And you, stop acting pregnant -- you're a man, for God's sakes.
    _Niles drops his hands.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven -- Claret
    Frasier is back at the same table, twiddling his thumbs and waiting for 
    his latest date.  Charlotte enters the restaurant and sees him.
    _
      **Frasier:** Charlotte, where's my date?
    **Charlotte:** I am so sorry.  She just called, she had to cancel.
      **Frasier:** That does it.
    **Charlotte:** No, we'll find another evening.
      **Frasier:** No, Charlotte, we will not.  You have sent me on enough 
               miserable dates, thank you.  Before you fix me up with a 
               doll-collecting war criminal, or a hashish-smoking burger 
               flipper, I want out!  And I want my money back.
    **Charlotte:** Frasier, this...
    _She pulls out the chair and sits down.  He reluctantly sits opposite 
    her._
    **Charlotte:** This is a process.  I have only sent you out on five dates.  
               Do you cure your patients in five sessions?
      **Frasier:** Well, no, but...
    _She takes a thick binder out of her purse._
    **Charlotte:** This client roster is filled with fascinating women.  I just 
               signed a new one this morning -- botany professor, avid bicycle 
               rider, _very_ striking.  But you know what?  If you're going 
               to be so impatient, then we should just end this now, I'll 
               write you a check. [_lifts her purse_]
      **Frasier:** Well, wait...
    **Charlotte:** No, no, no, no, I'm sure you'll do much better on your own.  
               With $10,000 you can download a lot of love.
      **Frasier:** Well, let's not be too hasty.  That striking, biking botanist 
               sounded like me.
    **Charlotte:** I don't know.
      **Frasier:** Please?
    **Charlotte:** Don't beg, it's a turn-off. 
    
    _She replaced the binder in her purse and gets up._ 
    
    **Charlotte:** All right.  Why don't I get us some drinks and then we can 
               talk about our next move?
      **Frasier:** Great.
    _She goes to the bar.  Overcome with curiosity, Frasier sneaks the binder 
    from her purse.  He flips through the first few pages, seeing portraits 
    of his five previous dates -- and the rest of the pages are blank.  He 
    looks up, enraged.
    
    At the bar, Charlotte is desperately talking him up to a group of four 
    women.
    _
    **Charlotte:** He's a big radio star -- smart, really sweet.  So think about 
               it.  Here's my card.
      **Frasier:**[_comes up behind her_] You lied to me.  You have five clients.  
               There is no roster of eligible women!
    **Charlotte:**[_snatches the binder back_] You looked at my client log?
      **Frasier:** Yes, I've seen your log, and I've dated every toad on it!
        **Woman:** Is this the guy?
    **Charlotte:** No, no, no, different guy.  Call me.
    _She leads him back to the table._
      **Frasier:** I think the police might be interested in this little scam 
               of yours.
    **Charlotte:** It is not a scam!  I... I just didn't have time to put the 
               other pictures in, and I will not work one second with 
               someone who threatens me.  I'll mail you a check.
    _She rises angrily, so does he._
      **Frasier:** I'll save you the price of a stamp.  I'll see you at your 
               office tomorrow.
    **Charlotte:** Fine.  I'd say come alone, but that's a given.
    _She walks toward the exit.  Suddenly her heel breaks off, she slips and
    lands hard on her knee, collapsing to the floor with a cry of pain.
    Frasier, the maitre 'd, and several diners gather around in concern._
    **Charlotte:**[_breaking down_] Oh God!  What a crappy, crappy day!
      **Frasier:** Charlotte, are you okay?
    **Charlotte:** I can't give you a check.  I've already... I've already spent 
               the money on rent, and food, and... and these shoes. [_takes one 
               off and hammers it on the floor_] These stupid, stupid shoes!
      **Frasier:**[_helps her up_] Come on now, it's okay.
    **Charlotte:** No, it's not!  Nothing's okay.  I lied to you.  I just 
               started this business.  But I'm really good at what I do!  
               I used to run the biggest matchmaking business in Chicago -- 
               before I lost it to my rotten ex-husband in the divorce. 
      **Frasier:** Divorce?  But you're wearing a wedding ring.
    **Charlotte:**[_holds up her hand_] It's camouflage.  It inspires confidence.  
               I mean, nobody wants a matchmaker whose life's a mess - like 
               me!
    _She bursts into tears, and Frasier helps her back to the table._
    **Charlotte:** I'm divorced, my business is a joke, and I'm up to my ass in 
               debt, and I had to move in with my mother.  I am thirty-five 
               years old, and I am living with my mother!  How pathetic is 
               that?
      **Frasier:**[_carefully_] Well, I... I've seen worse.  You mentioned 
               something earlier about having a drink.
    **Charlotte:** Oh, believe me, I will.  If my mother hasn't finished the 
               bottle.
      **Frasier:** No, I meant here. [_signals the waiter_]
    **Charlotte:** No, I really can't.  I've got to get home.  I have paperwork, 
               I have calls to make...
      **Frasier:** It's my treat.
    **Charlotte:**[_"life preserver!"_] Double Scotch.
    _DISSOLVE TO: 
    
    Scene Eight -- Claret -- Later that Night
    Frasier and Charlotte have moved on from drinks and are still talking 
    as they finish the remains of a meal.  Charlotte, much more relaxed,
    is toying with what's left on her plate, while Frasier has a glass of 
    brandy.
    _
    **Charlotte:** So then I spent five soul-sucking years in advertising 
               dreaming up slogans for Crunchios.
      **Frasier:** "Crunchios are a munchy with your lunchy or your brunchy."  
               That was you?
    **Charlotte:** Yeah.  I felt better about myself when I was pushing 
               cigarettes. [_Frasier laughs_] Then one day, I fixed up 
               my boss with my friend, and they ended up getting married.
      **Frasier:** And thus a career was born.
    **Charlotte:** What better way to make a living than by helping people be 
               happy?
    _Frasier smiles -- this speaks to him.
    _
      **Frasier:** So does your old boss toast you every year when he celebrates 
               his anniversary?
    **Charlotte:** Actually, he's a she now, and my friend's kind of bitter.  
               But I got the hang of it after that.  Well, until I lost 
               the business and came here and moved in with my crazy-ass 
               mother.
      **Frasier:** For what it's worth, it will get easier living with her.
    **Charlotte:**[_laughs_] Is that your professional opinion?
      **Frasier:** Actually, it's a personal one.  My dad lives with me.
    **Charlotte:** No.
      **Frasier:** Mm, 11 years.
    **Charlotte:** Yikes.
      **Frasier:** Yeah, yeah.  It does take a while to adjust to each other 
               before you're perfectly in sync.
    **Charlotte:** How long did that take?
      **Frasier:** I'll let you know. 
    _They laugh._
      **Frasier:** Ah, truth be told, I'm going to miss him when he moves out.
    **Charlotte:** I was missing my mother when I was in Chicago.  Now I just 
               wish she was missing. 
    _She checks her watch._
    
    **Charlotte:** I didn't realize it was so late. [_stands_] Frank's waiting 
               for me at home.
      **Frasier:**[_stands_] Frank?
    **Charlotte:** My boyfriend.
      **Frasier:** Oh... serious?
    **Charlotte:** Yes, but he has a fun-loving side, too.
      **Frasier:** No, I meant the relationship.  Do you lie awake nights 
               thinking about him?
    **Charlotte:**...A little.  It's still new, but I have my fingers crossed.
      **Frasier:** Well, good luck with it.
    **Charlotte:** Thank you. [_leans in_] And if you'll let me, I'm going to 
               find someone fantastic for you too, Frasier, because you 
               deserve it.
      **Frasier:** And because you have my $10,000.
    **Charlotte:** Are you going to mention that every time you see me?
      **Frasier:**[_backing off_] Well, all right...
    _They smile at each other.  He sits back down.  As she is leaving, 
    she glances back.  Frasier smiles to himself and opens the bill.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Nine -- Frasier's Bedroom
    The lights are off, and the clock over the bed reads "4:30 AM."
    Frasier is lying awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, his head
    cradled in his hands.
    _
    **Frasier:** Damn.
    _But he still can't keep from smiling, even as he gives a wistful sigh.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Cafe Nervosa:
    Daphne and Niles are enjoying a cinammon bun together.  Brad and Cindy 
    enter, pushing a pram.  Niles quickly throws a napkin over their pastry, 
    and they all greet each other.  Niles and Daphne look into the pram, 
    cooing over the baby.  
    
    Brad and Cindy go to the counter.  Daphne and Niles look at each other
    incredulously.  Daphne puffs out her cheeks and raises her arms like 
    flippers, Niles puffs out his own, both agreeing that it is the fattest 
    baby they've ever seen.
