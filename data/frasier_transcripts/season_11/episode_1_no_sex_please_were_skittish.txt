    _ACT ONE
    
    Scenes from[[10.24]](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_24/a_new_position_for_roz.html "A New Position For Roz") "A New Position for Roz"_
    
    **PREVIOUSLY**
    _Julia confronting Roz in her booth._
    
      **Julia:** Are you trying to save Frasier from me, or are you trying to
             save him for yourself?
        **Roz:** Are you out of you out of your mind?
      **Julia:** Are you in love with him?
    _CUT TO:
    
    Roz confronting Frasier at his apartment._
        **Roz:** It's her or me!  Tell me now, or I swear to God, I will walk 
             out of here and I will not come back!
    _Roz settling into her office at KPXY._
    **Wiswell:** There's no chance you'll change your mind again, is there?
        **Roz:** No.  KACL is ancient history.
    _FADE TO:_
    **SUBSEQUENTLY**
    
    _Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa
    FADE IN
    Niles is sitting at a table, Roz comes up.
    _
        **Roz:** Niles, I need to talk to you.  You're not with Frasier, are
             you?
      **Niles:** Why does everybody treat us like we're joined at the hip?  
             I do have coffee with other people other than my brother, 
             you know.
        **Roz:** Good.  'Cause I'm avoiding him.
      **Niles:** Oh, then talk fast.  He's meeting me in five minutes.
    _Roz sits next to him._
        **Roz:** It's about my new job.  It's a nightmare!
      **Niles:** Didn't you just start today?
        **Roz:** Yes.  My boss already hit on me, I'm supposed to work nights
             and weekends, and my assistant is an idiot and I can't fire 
             her 'cause she's like three minorities rolled into one.  I 
             can't believe I left KACL over some stupid snit.
      **Niles:** Oh yes, yes, your ultimatum.  Frasier told me about that.
             Listen, this isn't an easy subject to broach, but is it
             possible you're in love with Frasier?
        **Roz:** Absolutely not.
      **Niles:** You sound sure.
        **Roz:** I am sure.  I mean, if I were going to fall for him it would
             have been two years ago when we slept together.
      **Niles:** Well then, another theory I'd like to explore is... HO, back 
             up!  You and Frasier slept together?
        **Roz:** He didn't tell you?
      **Niles:** No... Well, I suppose it's only natural.  When the wolf and
             the lamb work together, it's only a matter of time before the
             wolf gets his way.  I hope you were gentle with him.
        **Roz:** Just promise you won't tell him I told you.
      **Niles:** I promise, I promise.  So, you're not in love.  But your
             behavior last night clearly indicates some sort of crisis.  
             As a psychiatrist...
        **Roz:** I just want my job back.  I'm not looking for some big therapy
             trip.
      **Niles:** All right.  Well, why don't you just sweep your emotions 
             under the rug and waltz back to the station as if nothing 
             ever happened.
        **Roz:** That's _perfect_!   Thanks!
    _She gets up from the table._
      **Niles:** No, no.   I was being facetious.  My real advice would be...
        **Roz:** I know.  Talk about my feelings.  Blah, blah, woof, woof.  
             I gotta go, Niles.  Thanks again.
    _She heads out, passing Martin and Daphne just outside._
     **Daphne:** Oh, hello, Roz.
     **Martin:** Hey, Roz.
    _Daphne and Martin come in.  She is holding a shopping bag._
     **Daphne:** Hello Darling.
      **Niles:** Hey, you.
    _They kiss._
     **Daphne:** Well, we're all set.  I got us a home pregnancy test, a basal
             body thermometer and ovulation kit.
    _Martin sits down._
      **Niles:** Oh, that's perfect.  I can upload all your data into this
             fertility program I bought.
     **Martin:** You kids sure know how to keep the romance alive. [to the 
             waiter] Two coffees, please.  Since when do you need a 
             chemistry set to have a baby?
     **Daphne:** I hear an "In my day..." coming.
     **Martin:** In my day it was simple: girl would put on something slinky,
             guy comes home, has a couple of pops, throws some Dean Martin
             on the Hi-Fi and bim-bam-boom, you're lightin' a Lucky.
    _Frasier comes in._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, Daphne.  Hi.  Niles, I've got to cancel our date, 
             I have to meet Roz's replacement over at the station before
             the show.
    _He notices the layout on the table._
    **Frasier:** What's this?  Are you pregnant?
     **Daphne:** Not yet, but we're trying.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, congratulations.  You've got all the fertility
             software and so forth?
      **Niles:** Of course.  We're not animals.
     **Daphne:** We're very excited.
      **Niles:** Yes, we were up half the night imagining life with our first
             child.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, first child you know about.
     **Daphne:** What does that mean?
    **Frasier:** Hmm?  Oh, it's not what you think, Daphne.  I was just 
             referring to the time Niles sold his sperm to a sperm 
             bank.  Surely you told her about it.
    _Niles looks flustered and is unable to speak as Daphne gives him a
    sharp glance._
    **Frasier:** Off I go.
    _He exits._
     **Daphne:** You sold your sperm?
      **Niles:** Well, it was when I was home from medical school.  I saw an
             ad for sperm donors, so I sold my sperm to a sperm bank...
     **Martin:** Would you stop using that word?!  Say "s."
      **Niles:** I sold my "s" to earn some money so I could buy Dad a
             Christmas present.
     **Martin:** Which present?
      **Niles:** The fishing pole.
     **Martin:** You bought that with "s" money?
     **Daphne:** Why didn't you tell me?
    _The waiter brings their coffees._
      **Niles:** Oh, it was such a long time ago it completely slipped my mind.
             You're not really upset, are you?
     **Martin:** Well of course I am!  That was my favorite pole.
     **Daphne:** I just thought this would be the first child for both of us.
             You could be a daddy already.  There could be dozens of 
             little Niles Cranes running around. [_points to a man_] HE 
             could be your son. [_points to another_] Or HIM.
      **Niles:** Oh, please, they look nothing like me.  Besides, I only went
             down there one time.  It's entirely possible they never used
             my sample.
    _An Impossibly Handsome Man comes over to the table._
        **Man:** Can I borrow your sugar?
     **Daphne:** Yeah.
    _Niles watches the youth, fascinated._
      **Niles:** I better look into this.
    _FADE OUT_
    **SHE'S ACK-BAY**
    
    _Scene Two - KACL
    FADE IN  
    
    Kenny and Frasier come into the hallway outside the producer's booth, 
    where a young lady is at the console._
      **Kenny:** There she is.  Now, I gotta warn you, Doc, she's uh, in a
             eelchair-way.
    **Frasier:** Does her handicap preclude her from understanding Pig Latin?
    _Kenny shrugs and leads Frasier into the booth._
      **Kenny:** Doctor Frasier Crane, king of the shrinks, meet Dana
             Willoughby, queen of the sound booth.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Dana.
       **Dana:** Oh, it's my pleasure.
    **Frasier:** Likewise, I'm sure.  Listen, if you have any questions,
             anything you'd like to know, please feel free to call on 
             me.  I'm here for you.
    _He notices Julia in the hallway._
       **Dana:** You know, actually, there was one...
    **Frasier:** Will you excuse me?
    _He hurries out.  Reset to: the hallway._
    **Frasier:** Julia!
      **Julia:** Oh, hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Listen, we still on for dinner at Chez Henri tonight?
      **Julia:** Of course.  Do you have reservations?
    **Frasier:** Not as long as you're wearing something black and slinky.
    _They laugh.  Dana calls over the intercom._
       **Dana:** Ten seconds, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Listen, why don't you stop by my place tonight for a cocktail
             first?
      **Julia:** I'll see you at seven.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
    _He hurries to his desk and punches the mike up.  He starts talking
    even as he's putting on his headset._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Our topic today
             is: new beginnings.  I'd like you all to join me in welcoming 
             a new member to the KACL family.
    _CUT TO: the hallway.  Kenny is at the vending machine and Roz walks 
    past._
        **Roz:** Hey, Kenny.  Sorry I'm late.
      **Kenny:** Hey, Roz... Whoa, whoa!  What are you doing here?
        **Roz:** I work here!
      **Kenny:** You quit.
        **Roz:** Oh, come on, Kenny.  If I quit, would I be here?  Who's that?
      **Kenny:** I'm sorry, I hired her because I thought... didn't you quit?
        **Roz:** Kenny, what's wrong with you?  Never mind.  I'll fix it, like
             always.
      **Kenny:** Oh, thanks, Roz.  I owe you one.
    _He hurries off.  CUT TO: the booth as Roz comes in._
    **Frasier:** As many of you may know, my producer of ten years, Roz Doyle,
             has left us for greener pastures.
    _Through the window, we can see Roz taking off Dana's headset and
    pulling her away from the console.  Frasier doesn't notice._
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz was not only known for her producing prowess,
             but also for her warmth, her kindness and her gentle spirit.
    _Behind him we see Dana shoved, arms flailing, down the hallway._
    **Frasier:** Very well, then, the beginning of a new era.  Let's go to our
             first caller.
        **Roz:**[_back at her console_] We have Scott on line two.
    _Frasier rears back in shock, knocking his headset off.  Roz just
    smiles at him.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE S BANK**
    
    _Scene Three - The S Bank
    Niles is standing in the waiting area, a nurse (Karen) is at the 
    counter._
      **Karen:** Niles Crane?
    _Niles steps up._
      **Karen:** Hi.  I'll get you a cup and you can start...
      **Niles:** No, no.  I've already donated my essence to your 
             establishment, now I'd like to get it back.
      **Karen:** I'm sorry.  It's against our policy to return essences.
      **Niles:** Oh, I see.  Well, could I at least check and see whether my
             donation was used?
    _She turns to the computer._
      **Niles:** You know, see if my deposit has drawn any interest. [_grins_]
      **Karen:** Sir, I've worked here twenty-eight years.  Think you can tell
             me one I haven't heard?  Go ahead, try me.
    _She stares at him, deadpan.  He folds._
      **Niles:** No.
      **Karen:**[_off the computer_] According to our records, your sample 
             wasn't used.
      **Niles:** So there are no little Niles Cranes running around.  What a
             relief.
      **Karen:**[_sarcastically_] Isn't it?
      **Niles:** Thank you for your time.
    _He starts to leave, then turns back to her._
      **Niles:** Just a quick question: based on my qualifications, I'd assumed
             there'd be some interest.  Any nibbles?
      **Karen:** According to our records, your sample was discarded.  It was
             rated sub-standard.
      **Niles:** "Sub-standard"?
      **Karen:** Your sperm had very low motility.
      **Niles:** So they're...
      **Karen:** Slow movers.
      **Niles:** Really.  But that was more than twenty years ago.  There's a
             chance that my situation's improved since then, isn't there?
      **Karen:** Can YOU run faster now than you could twenty years ago?
      **Niles:** So you're saying it might be difficult for my wife and me to
             conceive?
      **Karen:** Very difficult, yes.  I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** Uh, thank you.
    _He turns and walks across the room.  When he opens the door, there is
    a startled yell._
      **Niles:** Excuse me, sir!  Terribly sorry.  Carry on.
    _He closes the door, then goes to the exit the nurse is pointing at.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment
    FADE IN  
    
    Eddie is on the coffee table, his head buried in a bag of Cheetos.  
    The doorbell rings and Martin comes in from the kitchen to answer 
    it._
     **Martin:** Eddie, you get stuck in there again and you're on your own.
    _Eddie pulls free of the bag and jumps over to the couch.  Martin opens
    the door to reveal Niles._
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.  Is Frasier here?
     **Martin:** Uh, primping.
      **Niles:** Oh.
     **Martin:** He's going out with Julia.
      **Niles:** Right, right.  Daphne's going out with her mom tonight, so I
             thought I'd borrow a DVD.
     **Martin:** Oh, well, you're in luck.  I just picked this one up: "Crime
             Scene Bloopers 4: You Have the Right to Remain Zany."
      **Niles:** Sounds tempting, but I'm looking for something a little more
             soothing.  I didn't have the best day.
    _He grabs a different DVD from the shelf._
     **Martin:** Oh, what happened?
      **Niles:** Got some bad news at the "s" bank.  Apparently I suffer from
             low motility.
    _As he speaks, Niles walks around, shifting his loose baggy pants
    around._
     **Martin:** Oh.  Sorry, son.  How'd Daphne take it?
      **Niles:** Uh, well I haven't had the heart to tell her yet.  But I'm
             hoping I won't have to.  I did some research today and I found
             out, there's some things I can do to... rouse the troops.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah?  Like what?
      **Niles:** Uh, for instance wearing baggy pants.  And boxers instead of
             briefs.  Studies show that men who allow their genitals to
             swing freely...
     **Martin:** Okay, got it!
      **Niles:** And well, no hot baths, no alcohol, raw seafood, uh... and I
             started a regimen of dietary supplements.  Which reminds me...
    _He pulls out a small bottle._
     **Martin:** What's that?
      **Niles:** French maritime pine bark extract.  It boosts fertility and
             also acts as a mild euphoric.  Which accounts for the well-
             known joviality of French sailors.
    _He uses an eyedropper to take some while Martin looks on in distaste._
      **Niles:** Terrible aftertaste, though.
    _He grabs a Cheeto and pops it into his mouth, then makes a face of his
    own._
      **Niles:** I thought those were supposed to be crunchy.
    _Martin just shrugs and looks innocent.  Frasier comes in from the
    bedrooms._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.  Dad, Julia is on her way, you told me you'd keep
             to your room while she's here.
    _Martin gets up._
    **Frasier:** And take your Cheetos-stained dog with you.
     **Martin:** Eddie, come on boy.
    _Martin leads Eddie off as Niles notices his orange muzzle.  A look of
    disturbed realization crosses his face._
      **Niles:** I'll be leaving too.
    _He reaches for the DVD as Frasier puts the Cheetos in the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, could you stay for just a moment?  There's 
             something going on in my life that requires a bit of 
             mulling.  Sherry?
      **Niles:** No, thanks.
    **Frasier:** No?  But we never mull without sherry.
      **Niles:** Not for me.
    **Frasier:** Very well.  Have a seat.
    _He turns to get his sherry.  Niles does some knee-bends and leg shakes._
      **Niles:** Uh, I'd rather stand.
    **Frasier:** Suit yourself.  Anyway, it's about Roz.  After quitting her 
             job, TWICE, she shows up back at work again, today, waist-deep 
             in a sea of denial.  Well, I confronted her on the issue...
    _He breaks off as he notices Niles's movements._
    **Frasier:** What the hell are you doing?
      **Niles:** Sorry, go on.
    **Frasier:** Anyway, I confronted her on the issue, and she refused to 
             discuss it with me.  She wouldn't even look me in the eye.
             Which leads me to just one conclusion, Niles: She's in love
             with me.
    _He sits down and looks to Niles._
      **Niles:** I wouldn't necessarily jump to that conclusion...
    **Frasier:** That's because you don't have all the facts.  I've never
             shared this with you before, Niles, so brace yourself.  
             Two years ago, Roz and I slept together.
      **Niles:**[_feigning shock_] GET OUT!  You and Roz?
    **Frasier:** We did have a chance to discuss it, thoroughly.  Talk things
             out.  And at the time, she seemed happy to remain friends.
             But I realize, now, that I must have kindled a spark in her.
             That lit the torch she carries to this day.  So what do you
             think...?
    _He breaks off as he notices a low whine._
    **Frasier:** Are your pants humming?
      **Niles:** It's my testicular hypothermia device.  It promotes motility
             by keeping my nether regions at a cool and constant ninety-six 
             degrees.
    _The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.
      **Niles:** No, no.  That wasn't me...
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know!  I know that!
    _He gets up and answers the door.  It is Julia, carrying several bags._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Julia.  Hi.
      **Julia:** Hello.
    
    _They kiss._
    
    **Frasier:** Good to see you.  What's all this?
      **Julia:** It's dinner.  I know we said we'd go out, but I thought it'd
             be more fun to stay in.
    
    _Frasier notices another bag._
    
    **Frasier:** And what's in here?  Is this dessert?
    
    _Julia pulls a slinky black negligee from the bag._
    
      **Julia:** Well, you could call it that.
    _She smiles saucily, then notices Niles and stuffs it back in the bag._
      **Julia:** Oh, hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello.
      **Julia:** Well, I'll just go start dinner.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
    
    _She heads to the kitchen._
    
      **Niles:** Well, looks like someone's getting lucky tonight.
    **Frasier:** She was, but I'm beginning to have second thoughts.
      **Niles:** Why?
    **Frasier:** Niles, Julia and I have never been together sexually.  Look
             what happened with Roz.  We slept together two ago, she's
             still suffering.
    
    _Niles looks questioningly at his word choice._
    
    **Frasier:** In the sense of pining!
      **Niles:** Well, Frasier, you don't really suppose that after one night
             Julia...
    **Frasier:** Oh, open your eyes, Niles!  It's the same scenario: an
             infatuated co-worker, a night of passion.  What if things
             don't work out between us?  Every day she'll be forced to
             stare through the glass at me.  Wondering what might have
             been, until one day, like Roz, she goes MAD!
    
    _Niles checks his watch._
    
      **Niles:** Um... I'm leaving now.  Can I pick you up anything on Earth?
    
    _He heads for the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, don't you see?  I'm just trying to be responsible.
             I don't want to sleep with Julia until I know that there's
             a future for us.
      **Niles:** Well, Frasier, I'm sure you'll make the right choice.  But
             if you'll permit me an observation, you do tend to take
             things to extremes.
    
    _There is a beeping noise from Niles's pants._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, I have to plug myself into the cigarette lighter and
             recharge.
    
    _He leaves, Julia poses in the kitchen doorway._
    
      **Julia:** So, alone at last.
    
    _She licks the spoon she's holding._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes.  But you know, there's really no need for you to go to
             all this trouble.  I mean, we can still have dinner at Chez
             Henri's.
      **Julia:** No.  Dinner's coming along great.  In fact, I've got a little
             sauce right here if you want to taste it.
    **Frasier:** Oh.
    _Instead of kissing her, he wipes the sauce with a cracker and takes
    a bite._
    **Frasier:** Mmm.  That's yummy, yes.
    
    _Julia turns around and leans against him._
    
      **Julia:** I've had such a stressful day.  You know what would feel
             great?  A back rub.  You know where I could find a pair of
             strong, manly hands?
    **Frasier:** You know, I think Zoltan from the club makes house calls.
             Let me get you his number.
      **Julia:** Frasier, is everything all right?
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.
      **Julia:** Because if you're not interested...
    **Frasier:** No, no, I am.  I am.  I'm very interested.  It's just
             that... before we take things to the next level, you should
             know there are certain risks.
      **Julia:** Oh, my God, you've got a sexually transmitted dis...
    **Frasier:** No, no, no!  Of course not!  Of course not.  Although, in a
             manner of speaking...
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me.
    
    _He answers the door and looks through the peephole._
    
    **Frasier:** It's Roz!
      **Julia:** What's she doing here?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.  Listen, just give us a moment or two together
             and I'll get rid of her.
      **Julia:** Fine.
    
    _He opens the door as Julia goes back to the kitchen._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Can I come in?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    
    _She enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Is everything okay?
        **Roz:** Look, I know how crazy I've been acting lately.  Here last
             night, and today at the radio station.  I mean, I don't even
             understand it myself.  But  then I took a long walk and I
             think I've figured it out.  I just feel so stupid.
    **Frasier:** No, Roz.  Not stupid, human.  And all too vulnerable.  You've
             realized that you're in love with me.
        **Roz:** No, that's not it.
    **Frasier:** Come on...
        **Roz:** I can see why you'd think that, based on how I've been
             acting, but that's not it.
    **Frasier:** Okay, okay, just to be clear.  You haven't been pining for
             me since we slept together?
        **Roz:** God, no!  Weren't you there?
    _Stung, Frasier quickly rearranges his mental priorities._
    **Frasier:** Hold that thought, I've got to get in the kitchen and move
             something back to the front burner.
    
    _He hurries off.  
    
    Reset to - the kitchen as he enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Julia...
      **Julia:** Oh let me guess: Roz is staying for dinner.
    **Frasier:** No, no.  Just us.  Listen, I'd like to apologize for being
             skittish earlier.  I...just chalk it up to nerves.  I mean,
             after all, this is a big night for us.  We've never done this
             before.
      **Julia:** I have.
    **Frasier:**[__laughing__]  As have I.  What I meant was...
      **Julia:** No, I know what you meant.  You're forgiven.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  Where were we?  Oh, here.  I believe we were
             about to sample some sauce.
    _He dips his finger into the pan on the stove, then jerks in pain._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's hot!  Oh, God!  I'll just go get rid of Roz.
    _He rushes out to the living room.  
    
    Reset to - the living room as he hurries in, grabs Roz and rushes her 
    out the door._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz, we've got so much to talk about, what do you
             say we pick this up again tomorrow over a cup of coffee?
        **Roz:**[__laughing__] Okay.  Thank God.  You have quite the ego on you.
             We slept together like two years ago.  I mean what do you
             think you are, some kind of slow acting, time-release love
             bomb?
    
    _Unseen, Julia comes in from the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:**[__outraged__] I don't remember you having any complaints when
             we were in bed.  I seem to recall hearing the term "stallion-
             like"!
        **Roz:** I never said that.
    **Frasier:** Well, one of us did! 
      **Julia:** Okay, this is just too weird.
    **Frasier:** Julia...
      **Julia:** No, this is obviously a bad night for you.
    _She walks past them into the hall.  Frasier follows.  
    
    Reset to -- the hallway as Julia gets onto the elevator._
    
    **Frasier:** Look, Roz was just leaving.
      **Julia:** Well, I'll send the elevator back up for her.
    **Frasier:** Julia, I...
    
    _The doors close._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, I'm so sorry about that.
    **Frasier:** No, it's my fault.  I never should have let you in.
    _They go back inside.  
    
    Reset to - the living room as Frasier closes the door._
        **Roz:** Well, I guess I've given Julia another reason to hate me.
    **Frasier:** She doesn't hate you, Roz.
        **Roz:** Well, she doesn't like me.  And when the girlfriend doesn't
             like the friend, guess who gets the boot?
    **Frasier:** That's not always true.
    
    _Roz sits down on the couch._
    
        **Roz:** I just went through this with my dad.  I was always really
             close to him, even after my parents split up.  And six months
             ago, he married this woman I don't get along with and it's
             like I don't exist.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.
        **Roz:** That's what I finally realized tonight.  I guess I saw Julia
             getting her hooks into you and I, I freaked.
    
    _Frasier sits beside her._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, the day a woman says I can't be friends with you is the
             day I know I picked the wrong woman.
        **Roz:** Thanks, Frasier.
    
    _They hug, then Frasier gets up._
    
    **Frasier:** Say, Julia has a dangerously hot meal cooking in the kitchen.
             Why don't you stay?
        **Roz:** Oh, that sounds great. [__getting up__] Wait.  She went to all
             this trouble to make this dinner for you, if she finds out
             I'm the one who ate it it'll kill her.
    **Frasier:** You can't tell her, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, come on, please?
    
    _She skips into the kitchen after him.  
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Niles's Apartment
    The living room is lit softly and music is playing on the stereo.  
    Niles comes in the front, then looks around in confusion._
    
      **Niles:** Hello?
    
    _Daphne appears on the landing wearing a black negligee._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    _Niles's mouth drops open in shock and he drops the DVD he's holding._
      **Niles:** Daphne!  What are you doing here?  I thought you had plans
             tonight.
    
    _She comes down the stairs._
    
     **Daphne:** Who says I don't?
    _She uses a remote to start the fireplace and gets a bottle of champagne 
    out of the ice bucket._
    
     **Daphne:** Champagne?
      **Niles:** Oh, sounds wonderful.  On second thought, not tonight.
     **Daphne:** I just thought you might like something to wash down these
             oysters.
    
    _She holds up a tray._
    
      **Niles:** Oohhh... actually, I'm avoiding raw seafood.  Would it be too
             much trouble to put them in a bisque?
     **Daphne:** Now?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry.  I'm just a little surprised by all this.
    _He takes the tray and puts it down.  Daphne puts her arms around him._
     **Daphne:** I just thought I'd follow your father's advice: a little less
             science, a little more romance.
    _She kisses him, then notices the odd humming and beeping.  She draws
    back and stares at his pants._
    
     **Daphne:** And apparently it's working.
      **Niles:** That would be my TestiCool 2000.
     **Daphne:** Your what?!
    
    _He motions and they sit on the couch._
    
      **Niles:** I should have told you this earlier, I had some disappointing
             news today.  It seems that I suffer from low motility and it
             might not be possible for us to conceive.
     **Daphne:** Oh.
      **Niles:** I'm so sorry.
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't be sorry.  We'll be all right.  There's so many
             things they can do these days to help infertile couples.
      **Niles:** True.
     **Daphne:** And until we find out more, I don't see why we don't give
             Mother Nature a shot.
    
    _She pulls a test kit from her negligee._
    
     **Daphne:** I took the test today, I'm ovulating.
      **Niles:**[__taking it__] Ohhh... well, in that case, the last one
             upstairs...
    
    _They get up and hurry for the stairs, but Niles pulls up short._
    
      **Niles:** Uh, Daph, this isn't the ovulation kit, it's the pregnancy
             test.
     **Daphne:** Oh, silly me.  They look so much ali...
    
    _They both stare at the test._
    
      **Niles:** We're pregnant.
     **Daphne:** Oh, my God, we are, aren't we?
      **Niles:** But my slow sperm...
     **Daphne:** I must have fast eggs.
      **Niles:** Oh, Daphne, I love you!
     **Daphne:** I love you too!
    _They embrace.  Niles's pants emit a sharp beeping noise and he begins
    jerking from electric shocks._
    
      **Niles:** Ow, ooh, ah!  Something seems to be short-circuiting!
    _He stumbles up the stairs, twitching and gasping.  Daphne watches him
    go, then looks down and smiles, patting her belly._
    
     **Daphne:** That's your daddy!
    
    _She turns and heads up the stairs.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
