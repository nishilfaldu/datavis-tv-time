The theory deliberately rebutted Charles Darwin's theories that the earth is several hundred million years old, and that all species, including man, gradually evolved from lesser ones.  Particularly offensive to creationists is Darwin's theory that humans are descended from apes.  This debate was particularly heated in the American South, where several states passed laws prohibiting the teaching of Darwin's theories in elementary schools -- which led to the highly public \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" in the 1930's, upon which the play \"Inherit the Wind\" was based.
