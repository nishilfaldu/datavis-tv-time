    **Skyline:** The crescent moon rises over the city.
    
    _ACT I
    
    Scene One - KACL
    Frasier is standing by._
    
    **Frasier:** We still have a few minutes left, and all our lines are open.
             Uh, shall I attempt another joke?
        **Roz:**[_quietly_] No.
    
    _Frasier still looks at her questioningly._
    
        **Roz:**[_louder_] No!
    **Frasier:** All right, then.  Come on, callers, don't be shy.  There's 
             still time to talk with the good doctor.  Five open lines.
    
    _Roz looks up at the time._
    
    **Frasier:**[_beginning an act_] Who's this, then, Roz?  On line one, uh, 
             whom do we have?  I understand we have... Susan, who recently 
             moved here from... Texas.
    _He gestures to Roz to play along, and she shakes her head wearily, 
    pleading no.  She does not want to do this._
    
    **Frasier:** Go ahead, Susan, I'm listening.
        **Roz:**[_giving in, putting on a Texas accent_] Hi, Dr. Crane.
    
    [_N.B.  Peri Gilpin is originally from Waco, Texas._]
    
        **Roz:** I'm new in town, from Texas, and uh, I just left my husband.
    **Frasier:** I see, and why did you do that?
        **Roz:** Well, uh... [_suddenly resuming her normal speech_] Oh, I know, 
             he was abusive!
    **Frasier:**[_glaring at her_] That couldn't have been easy for you.
        **Roz:**[_resuming Texas accent_] Well, my girlfriend helped me.  
             We just got in our convertible and drove through the 
             desert, and we stopped at this honky-tonk.  I started 
             dancing with this cowboy--long story short, he roughed 
             me up, and my friend killed him--but then... we met the 
             cutest cowboy, but he stole all our money, so we robbed 
             a gas station and blew up a tanker truck...
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm afraid we're out of time. I will finish with you 
             off the air, _Susan_.  Meanwhile, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, 
             saying Good Day, Seattle, and Good Mental Health. 
    
    _He signs off.  Roz enters from her booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you, Thelma.  Or is it Louise?
        **Roz:** Don't snap at me because you didn't get any phone calls today.  
             I told you not to put me on the spot again.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Roz, but I was desperate.  You know, I really think 
             you were closer with that character yesterday--the young teen 
             who moved into the town that had banned dancing.  Now that, 
             that had the tang of reality.
        **Roz:** That was _Footloose_ , you idiot.
    
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's apartment
    Martin opens the door to Ronee._
     **Martin:** Hey, I thought you were working tonight.
      **Ronee:** I got the night off, and I am kidnapping you for the weekend.
     **Martin:** Oh, where we going?
      **Ronee:** My boss gave me his house in the mountains.  It's very 
             romantic.  There's this little family of deer that comes 
             right up to the window, so you might want to bring your...
     **Martin:** My camera?  I will.
      **Ronee:** I was going to say gun, but suit yourself.  Oh, you are going 
             to love it.  There's this amazing view of the lake.  You can 
             see every star in the sky.
     **Martin:** Wow! Is there a VCR there? Because I just bought a couple of 
             great old Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire movies. 
    
    _He gets them.  They have Blockbuster logos._
    
      **Ronee:** Well, why didn't you just rent them?
     **Martin:** I did, last August.
      **Ronee:** Oh.  Let's get moving.  I don't want to get stuck in traffic.
     **Martin:** Sounds good, I'll go pack some food.  That was really nice of 
             your boss to give you the cabin.  What made him do it?
      **Ronee:** I put out.
     **Martin:** That's my girl!
    
    _She goes to the powder room.  Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** I hate people.
     **Martin:** What's the matter with you?
    **Frasier:** In a perfect ending to a perfect day, the driver next to me 
             swerved to avoid hitting a squirrel, running me into a pothole 
             and drenching me in coffee.  I hate squirrels, too. 
    
    _He hangs his coat._
    
     **Martin:** Well, maybe it was for the best.  The coffee might have made 
             you irritable.
    
    _Frasier grins at him sarcastically, then goes to the bar._
    
    **Frasier:** My show today was a fiasco.  For the second day in a row, 
             we had virtually no callers.  It's getting harder and harder 
             to blame it on Roz.
     **Martin:** Well, maybe you fixed everybody.
    **Frasier:** Oh wait, there was one caller.  My date for Saturday night 
             called to cancel because I am not her type.  Oh, and guess 
             what?  Her honesty was not refreshing.
    
    _Frasier picks up a bottle.  It is empty._
    
    **Frasier:** Dear God, we're out of sherry.  Insult... [_placing the bottle 
             down_] made injury.
    
    _He goes to the kitchen.  Martin follows._
    
     **Martin:** Well, here's something that will cheer you up.  Ronee's boss 
             gave her his cabin for the weekend, so we're heading up there 
             tonight.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Well, being home alone for the weekend might be just the 
             thing for someone in my state of mind.  Me... and my shadow of 
             a life.
    _Frasier's back is to Martin.  Eddie begs and paws at Martin, 
    who addresses him._
     **Martin:**[_to Eddie_] Hey!  We're not leaving you at home.  You're coming 
             with us.  It wouldn't be any fun without you.
    **Frasier:**[_turning around holding a glass_] Oh really, Dad?  I was so 
             hoping that you would say that.  The last thing I wanted to 
             do was spend the weekend here wallowing in self-pity.  Leave 
             it to you to see right through me, and toss me a lifeline.
    
    _They return to the living room, where Ronee is on the couch._
     **Martin:**[_not sure how to react_] Well, uh, now are you sure, Fras? 
             'Cause, you know, uh, come to think of it, there are lots 
             of squirrels up there.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I-I don't mind them in their own milieu.  Oh, gosh, 
             I'm so looking forward to taking in some mountain air with 
             the two of you, and isn't this fortuitous?  I've just had 
             my Tyrolean hat re-feathered.
      **Ronee:**[_to Martin_] Can I talk to you?
    _Martin nods sheepishly.  They go to the kitchen.  Frasier opens the 
    door to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier, I have had... the worst day imaginable.  I need a 
             sherry.
    **Frasier:** Brace yourself.
      **Niles:**[_noticing the empty bottle_] You always think it's going to 
             happen to someone else.
    **Frasier:** I've opened some wine, Niles.  Help yourself.
      **Niles:** Oh, thanks.  Two of my patients cancelled, and Daphne and I 
             spent the afternoon arguing over which diaper pail we would 
             buy for the nursery.  Then, driving home, I successfully 
             avoided hitting a squirrel, only to be nearly run off the 
             road by some horn-happy maniac.
    **Frasier:** That was me, you simp, you nearly killed me.
      **Niles:** You nearly killed me!  And what was that crude multi-part 
             gesture you unleashed on me?
    **Frasier:** I had hot coffee all over my hand. 
    
    _He waves, demonstrating._
    
    **Frasier:** You know what, I do not wish to delve into this.  I am trying 
             to put my own miserable day behind me.  To that end, Ronee and 
             Dad are going to the mountains this weekend, and I've decided 
             to tag along.
      **Niles:** Ah.  So it'll be just two wheels and you.
    **Frasier:** What are you saying?
      **Niles:** Well, just that if Ronee and Dad are going away for the 
             weekend, it might have been more considerate not to horn in.
    **Frasier:** I'm not horning in, they invited me.
      **Niles:** Ah.  I would never dream of accepting such an obvious pity 
             invite.
    **Frasier:** Well, you don't have to dream because they didn't invite you.
    
    _CUT TO: Martin and Ronee in the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** It happened so fast, then he got all excited and I didn't know 
             what to say.
      **Ronee:** Well, how about "I was talking to the dog?"
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, the poor guy's going through a bad patch right 
             now.  He could use a little company.  We don't have to spend 
             any time with him.
      **Ronee:** Marty, you know I love Frasier, but this was supposed to be 
             our weekend, you know, you and me alone.
     **Martin:** I know.
      **Ronee:** But hey, why stop at Frasier?  Why not invite Niles and Daphne 
             and make it a party?
    _Niles has walked in, Ronee's back to him, just in time to hear this._
      **Niles:** We'd love to!  Thank you, Ronee!  Thanks, Dad! [_exiting, with 
             a taunting tone_] Frasier...
    _Ronee sighs and turns to Martin.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    **MY BROTHER'S REAPER**
    _Scene Three - The kitchen of a mountain cabin.
    Daphne is at the counter.  Martin and Ronee are preparing to go out.  
    Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Morning.
     **Daphne:** You're finally up.  How'd you sleep?
    **Frasier:** Perfectly.  I was borne off to dreamland by the cooing of a 
             morning dove.
      **Ronee:** Oh, I heard that too.  I think the weasels are in heat.
     **Martin:** Ronee and I are taking a walk down to the lake.  Anybody 
             interested?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no thanks, Pa.  I'm fixin' to have me some vittles.
      **Ronee:** Is he going to talk hillbilly all weekend?
     **Martin:** Ah, you should have heard him the weekend of the Renaissance 
             Faire.
    **Frasier:** See you guys later.
     **Martin:** All right.
      **Ronee:** Okay, bye.
    _Martin and Ronee exit, leaving Frasier and Daphne alone.  From this 
    point on, it is clear that the scene is a dream sequence.  Note that 
    Daphne is wearing a lounge outfit, and is very pregnant._
    **Frasier:** Ah, Daph.  You know who would have really enjoyed this trip? 
             [_wistfully_] Niles.
     **Daphne:** You're right.  But let's not dwell on that.  We'll make our 
             own fun.
    
    _She tenderly touches his shoulder._
    
    **Frasier:** Right.  Something smells good.  Whatcha cookin'?
     **Daphne:** Sausage patties.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Hope they're hot and spicy.  That's the way I like it.
     **Daphne:** I know you do.
    
    _They laugh in a playful, teasing manner._
    
     **Daphne:** You're so different from your brother.
    **Frasier:** Really?  How so?
     **Daphne:** Well, for one thing... you're alive.
    
    _They both laugh heartily._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I can't believe there are still people who blame me 
             for Niles's death.
     **Daphne:** Oh, people will talk about anything.  So you sliced him to 
             ribbons with your wheat thresher.  It was your first time 
             farming, for God's sakes.
    
    _Frasier nods his agreement._
    
     **Daphne:** What did I do with the salt?  Hmmm...
    _She turns the largest canister.  Next to matching ones labeled "Flour, 
    Sugar," etc., it clearly reads "Niles."_
     **Daphne:** Maybe I left it in the dining room.
    _She moves across the room to another cupboard and turns the smallest 
    of another set of canisters.  It is labeled "Eddie."  She exits the 
    kitchen._
     **Daphne:**[_calling from behind the door_] Oh, I forgot to mention...
    **Frasier:** What's that, dear?
    _A very non-pregnant Daphne now enters in a sexy red nightie, holding a 
    swaddled bundle._
     **Daphne:** I just had your baby.
    **Frasier:**[_rising_] I have never seen anything more beautiful in my 
             entire life.
    _He tenderly takes the "baby" from Daphne, unceremoniously throws it on 
    the counter, and takes her in a passionate kiss and embrace.  
    
    SMASH CUT TO: a horrified Frasier waking up from his dream.  He gasps 
    and contorts his face in puzzlement over the frightening dream.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Four - The same kitchen
    Cut from the preceding.  The following scene is clearly back in 
    "reality."  It is late at night, and Niles is seated at the table 
    reading.  Frasier enters._
      **Niles:** Frasier?  I thought you went to bed.
    **Frasier:** I-I had a rather bizarre dream.
      **Niles:** Really?  What about?
    **Frasier:** Oh... 
    _Long pause._
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm not sure you'd really want to hear about this one,
             Niles.
      **Niles:** Well, clearly it troubled you.  It might help you to discuss 
             it.  You know how I enjoy interpreting dreams.
    **Frasier:** Mmm... Well, all right, uh... [_clears throat_] it took place in 
             this very kitchen, and... I was married to Daphne and we were 
             expecting a baby, and, uh... you were dead, and I killed you. 
    
    _He has now seated himself._
    
      **Niles:** Well, I can see how that might disturb you.
    **Frasier:** Indeed. [_He sips his coffee._]
      **Niles:** A man of your intellect having such an obvious dream.
    **Frasier:** I beg your pardon?
      **Niles:** Oh, come on.  You're lonely, and you envy what I have.  I was 
             just hoping for something more complex, you know, a stairway 
             leading nowhere or Mom giving you a physical.
    **Frasier:** Well, there were many other perplexing details that I left 
             out.  For instance, uh, well there was um... a wheat thresher 
             and... some sausage patties.  And Eddie was dead, too.
      **Niles:** Ah, well, there's a real head-scratcher.
    
    _Niles mockingly waves his hand next to his ear._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you for your exhaustive analysis, Dr. Crane.  
             Perhaps you should relocate your offices to a drive-thru 
             so your patients could speak into a clown's nose.
      **Niles:** All right, I'm going to bed now.  I was hoping this book 
             would make me drowsy, but it looks like your dream has done 
             the trick instead. 
    
    _He exits out the door Daphne used in the dream._
    
    **Frasier:**[_calling out to him petulantly_] You died tragically, and no 
             one missed you!
    
    _Frasier sips his coffee.  
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - KACL
    Frasier enters Roz's booth._
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Finally, your show's about to start.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.  We just got back from the mountains this morning.
        **Roz:** Well, you're about to get all the vacation you can handle.  
             Kenny says if you don't get a call today, you're off the air.
    **Frasier:** What?!  Well, we're bound to get a call.
        **Roz:** Why?  We haven't had a call in six months.
    _It is revealed that Roz's control panel is covered in cobwebs, 
    indicating that this is another dream._
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.
        **Roz:** You're on!
    **Frasier:** What?  
    _He pushes a button on the cobweb-covered panel._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Who's our first 
             caller, Roz?
        **Roz:** We have no one from nowhere.
    **Frasier:** Very amusing, Roz.
    
    _A phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:** What's that sound?
        **Roz:** It's a phone!  Go get it!  Hurry!
    **Frasier:** Oh!
    _He rushes out of the booth.  The studio desk is covered with phones, 
    red and black.  Frasier picks up a red one._
    **Frasier:** Hello!  Hello, Seattle, I'm listening!
        **Roz:** Not that one, the black one!
    
    _He tries one of the black ones._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello!  Seattle, I'm listening. [_It's not the right one._]
        **Roz:**[_pointing_] Right there!
    **Frasier:**[_trying again_] Hello!  Hello, Seattle...
        **Roz:** Hurry!  They're going to hang up.
    _The multiple rings continue, raising to a pitch.  Frasier keeps trying 
    different phones._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello... Hello... Hello...
    _Through the cobwebs, we see Roz decked out in a_ Thelma and Louise _-style 
    headscarf and sunglasses.  She is behind a steering wheel mounted on 
    the control panel._
        **Roz:**[_Texas accent_] If you don't find that phone, I'm driving this 
             booth off a cliff.
    **Frasier:**[_desperately trying to find the right one_] Hello.... Hello.... 
             Oh, God, I'm trying to listen... [_He sobs._]
    _SMASH CUT TO: He suddenly wakes up in his bed at the cabin._
    **Frasier:** Oh!  Damn it!
    _FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT I
    
    ACT II_
    
    **SWEENEY TOT**
    _Scene Six - A surreal-looking nursery, with very bright colors and 
    loud decor.  Throughout the scene, Daphne's voice is heard as through 
    a loudspeaker/PA system.  We do not see her in the course of the dream.  
    Niles is sitting in a bright red chair near a bright green table, 
    trying to take care of a baby._
     **Daphne:**[_v.o., fade in_] Niles, how's the baby?  Have you fed the baby 
             yet?
    
    _Niles dutifully grabs a bottle and starts to feed._
    
     **Daphne:** Make sure you warm the bottle first, but not too hot.  Should 
             I come up?
    _The bottle has become an ignited stick of dynamite in Niles's hand.  
    He quickly tosses it back, and we hear an explosion.  Niles jerks 
    the baby up and back._
     **Daphne:** What was that?  Is everything all right up there?  I'm coming 
             to check.
    
    _Niles sets the baby down and takes the bottle to a warmer._
    
     **Daphne:**[_over Niles's actions_] Don't forget to burp him.  If you don't 
             burp him, he'll cry.  I'd better do it myself.  Here I come.  
             Is the baby okay?  What's going on?  I'm on my way.
    _Niles leans on a florescent green crib.  A buzzing sound is heard.  
    We see that Niles has set the baby on a conveyor belt and the bundle 
    is heading toward a saw-blade, head first.  He quickly saves and 
    cuddles it._
     **Daphne:** He's going to need a new nappy, too.  But don't forget 
             your other responsibilities, Niles.  There's lots of 
             other responsibilities.
    _Niles sets the baby down again.  He goes to an oven and puts the 
    finishing pinches on an unusually large pie, which he places in 
    the oven over Daphne's following speech._
     **Daphne:** You have to prioritize, and the baby comes first.  Is he all 
             right?  I'm coming up there.
    _He closes the oven door and goes back to the crib.  He pulls something 
    out of the crib, but it is a bag of apples._
     **Daphne:** Make sure you support his head when you hold him.  Are you 
             doing it right?  I'm coming to check.  Are you ignoring me?  
             Why don't I hear anything?  Do I have to do everything around 
             here?
    _Realizing, Niles rushes to the oven.  After the smoke clears, 
    he removes the pie, digs into it, and pulls out the baby._
     **Daphne:** Do I smell something burning?
    
    _Niles sniffs the baby._
    
     **Daphne:** I'm on my way.
    _Niles sees that the bottle warmer is smoking and begins to run to it.  
    As he does, he trips, and the baby flies into the air.  When it lands, 
    we see porcelain shatter across the floor._
     **Daphne:** What was that?  I'd better not find a mess.  I have enough 
             work taking care of the baby.  I can't clean up after you, 
             too.
    _Niles frantically begins picking up the pieces of the "baby."  He sees 
    the doorknob with child guard begin to turn.  The camera focuses on his 
    face, a picture of sheer horror._
     **Daphne:** Is everything all right in there?
    _SMASH CUT TO: 
    The scene cuts back to the cabin.  Niles, in bed next to Daphne, 
    awakens from his nightmare._
      **Niles:**[_sitting up, gasping_] I can't do it.
     **Daphne:** It's just as well, I'm too tired anyway.
    
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - The cabin kitchen
    Frasier is seated, playing a chess set (the one he won from Wayne 
    Shafter in[[11.12]](/frasier/transcripts/season_11/episode_12/frasier_lite.html "Frasier-Lite") "Frasier-Lite"?)  Daphne enters from the door she 
    did when presenting Frasier with his child in his dream.  She is 
    dressed in the same lounge outfit as in that dream.  She looks 
    pregnant.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh, you couldn't sleep either?
     **Daphne:** Just thought I'd fix meself a little snack. 
    
    _She explores the cupboards._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, you're entitled, eating for two.
     **Daphne:** I had the baby five months ago.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Yes, that's right, I had Roz send you some flowers.
    _Daphne now looks slightly larger than before as she turns around.  
    Clearly, this is Daphne's dream._
     **Daphne:** I just have a few extra pregnancy pounds I haven't been able 
             to lose yet.  I work out every day.  It's really starting to 
             show.
    _She is now noticeably larger in the lower half of her body.  She lifts 
    dumbbells with both arms._
    **Frasier:** Oh yes.  Well done.  I'll have Roz send you some flowers.
    _Niles enters from outside in his bathrobe, accompanied by a busty 
    blonde in a blue bikini.  She is wearing a toolbelt and carrying a 
    plunger._
      **Niles:** Excuse us.  The plumber has to fix the leaky faucet in our 
             bedroom.
     **Daphne:** Oh, sure.  Go right on up.
    _Niles leads the "plumber" by the hand through the now familiar door out 
    of the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** Isn't he a clever one, finding a plumber at this hour?  Isn't 
             he a clever one, finding a plumber at this hour.
    _Daphne has expanded again.  She is unnaturally large, exceeding even 
    her peak in the first part of Season Eight (a subtle reminder of that 
    storyline?)_
    **Frasier:** Yes, indeed.  How fat of you to notice.
    _A knock at the front door.  Daphne answers to a gorgeous brunette in a 
    tan bikini.  She also wears a toolbelt._
     **Daphne:** Hello.
      **Woman:** I'm here about the cable problem?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I don't know anything about that.
      **Niles:**[_rushing back in_] I'll handle this, Darling. [_suggestively_] 
             Cable's out in the bedroom.
      **Woman:**[_sultry tone_] Well, let's see what you've got going on in 
             there.
    
    _Niles takes her hand and beamingly leads her back._
    
     **Daphne:** Bless him.  He's on top of everything around here.
    **Frasier:**[_contemplating his chess set_] You know, I really miss playing 
             with Niles.  He's so busy sleeping with other women.
     **Daphne:** What did you say?
      **Niles:**[_re-entering_] Have you seen Dad?
    _Daphne has expanded yet again.  She is truly huge, and her face now 
    also shows it._
     **Daphne:** Do you still think I'm beautiful?
    _Another busty blonde enters from another door.  She wears a flannel 
    bikini top and tight khaki shorts, and carries Martin's cane._
      **Niles:** Dad!  There you are.  I need to show you something in the 
             bedroom.
    _He takes her hand and leads her back where he took the other two.
    Daphne runs after him in her hot-air-balloon-like state._
     **Daphne:** Niles, wait!
    _She tries to go through the door after them, but she cannot fit through 
    and bounces back.  She calls after Niles._
     **Daphne:** Please tell me you think I'm beautiful!  Niles, answer me!
    _Her face is now so fat that it distorts her speech.  She begins to sob.  
    
    SMASH CUT TO: Suddenly she awakens next to Niles._
     **Daphne:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Are you all right?
     **Daphne:** How could you?!
    
    _She hits him with a pillow._
    
      **Niles:** I'm sorry?
     **Daphne:** You'd better be!
    _Niles cowers.  Daphne turns around and goes back to sleep.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    **IT'S ENOUGH TO WAKE THE DAD**
    
    _Scene Eight - The cabin kitchen
    Back in reality.  Daphne enters from the familiar door, in the same 
    lounge outfit.  Frasier is playing chess._
     **Daphne:**[_grumpily_] Hello.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Daph.
     **Daphne:** What are you doing here?
    **Frasier:** Had a nightmare.  Couldn't get back to sleep.
     **Daphne:**[_sitting_] That's strange.  Niles had a nightmare, too.  
             And I just dreamt...
    **Frasier:**[_interrupting_] Niles had a nightmare?
     **Daphne:** Mm-hmm.
    **Frasier:** What about?
     **Daphne:** He dropped the baby and it shattered.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckling_] That's perfect.  Wait a minute.  How did he drop 
             it?  Was it from a height?  In a crowd?  Was there water 
             involved?
     **Daphne:** No, it was in the nursery.
    **Frasier:**[_satisfied_] Yes!
    
    _Niles enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Niles!  I understand you had a bad dream. 
             [_He chuckles._]
      **Niles:** Yes, it was utterly inscrutable.  There was a table saw and 
             apple pies, and...
    **Frasier:** Spare me, Niles, you broke the baby.  Now who has the obvious 
             dreams?
      **Niles:** It was still more interesting than yours. [_to Daphne_] Frasier 
             dreamed he killed me and married you.
     **Daphne:** At least he wasn't cheating on me with the service people 
             because I was fat!
      **Niles:** Will you please stop blaming me for something I did in your 
             dreams?
     **Daphne:** So you admit it?
      **Niles:** Daphne, Daphne, I will always find you attractive.  Your dream 
             shouldn't worry you at all, unlike mine.  I could very well 
             turn out to be a bad father.
    **Frasier:** At least you two can face your fears together.  Whom do I have 
             to hug away my nighttime terrors, hmm?
     **Daphne:** Oh, boo-hoo, send yourself some flowers.
    **Frasier:** I beg your pardon?  That's a rather flippant comeback, when I 
             express myself...
      **Niles:**[_talking over him_] Don't you take that tone with my wife!
     **Daphne:** He finally notices I'm in the room.
    _They all begin to argue over each other.  Martin enters in his 
    bathrobe._
     **Martin:** What the hell is going on here?
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, it's this infernal mountain air.  It's giving us 
             all nightmares.
     **Martin:** All of you?
    **Frasier:** Well, Daphne dreamed that she was terminally fat, Niles that 
             he was going to be a bad parent, and... well, at least mine 
             arose from a real problem, the fact that I will always be 
             alone.
    
    _They start to talk over him._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, geez, we come up here to relax, and you're arguing about 
             your dreams?
      **Niles:** Well, dreams that reveal genuine anxieties, which...
     **Martin:** Blah, blah, blah. [_to Daphne_] You're going to lose your looks?  
             Happens to everyone. [_to Frasier_] You're afraid you're going 
             to end up alone?  You'll still have your family. [_to Niles_] 
             You're afraid you're going to be a bad father?  Join the club.  
             Now just clam it up and go to bed. 
    
    _He exits._
    
      **Niles:** You know, I'm starting to regret inviting him up here.
    
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Nine - The cabin living room
    Martin is getting a drink.  The other three enter from the kitchen.
    It should be noted that unlike the previous scene, Martin's dressing
    gown is cinched up to well above his collar, obscuring his neck._
    **Frasier:** Dad, we're sorry.
      **Niles:** You were right.
     **Daphne:** Maybe we let our problems get to us a bit too much.
     **Martin:** Well, hell yes, if they're the worst of your problems, you're 
             lucky.  I've got a bullet in my hip, a girlfriend who's too 
             good for me and might realize it any day, a dog who's pushing 
             eighty in human years, and I'm not far behind him.  But you 
             don't hear me making a fuss, do you?  Know why?  'Cause I 
             focus on what's good about my life.  You know what you people
             should do?  Let's tell them, Ronee.
    _Suddenly, Ronee appears behind a piano, wearing a robe.  We have now 
    entered Martin's dream.  As she begins to play, he begins to sing, 
    shedding his robe and tossing it to Frasier, Niles, and Daphne.  
    
    Underneath he is now wearing a tuxedo with tails.  As he starts his 
    song, he tosses his cane like Astaire would toss his umbrella, and then 
    catches a snappy walking stick that is tossed back to him.  It becomes 
    a full-fledged dance number._
     **Martin:**[_singing_] _Grab your coat and get your hat
                       Leave your worries on the doorstep
                       Life can be so sweet
                       On the sunny side of the street_
    _The scene darkens, and the piano accompaniment fades into a full 
    orchestration for the transition to the next verse.  Feathers pass 
    in front of Martin's face, and they are revealed to be the hats of 
    a group of Rockette-like dancers who accompany the rest of the number.  
    
    Martin and the dancers step upon a Vegas-like stage with full lighting 
    as the second verse begins._
     **Martin:**[_singing_] _Can't you hear that pitter-pat?
                       And that happy tune is your step
                       Life can be complete
                       On the sunny side of the street_
    _Ronee now joins him onstage wearing a ball gown.  She dances with him 
    and they sing the rest of the song together._
     **Martin/Ronee:**    _I used to walk in the shade
                       With my blues on parade
                       But I'm not afraid
                       And this rover, crossed over_
    
    _They now harmonize._
    
     **Martin/Ronee:**    _If I never have a cent
                       I'll be rich as Rockefeller
                       Gold dust at my feet
                       On the sunny side of the street!_
    _The number ends.  Martin and Ronee bow and wave.  
    
    DISSOLVE TO: the scene fades to the two of them cuddling in bed 
    together, completely content.  In his sleep, he pulls her closer,
    she gives a "mmm" and snuggles up to him._
    [_N.B. "On the Sunny Side of the Street" is a jazz standard by 
    Fields/McHugh._]
    _FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    The family is seated at the table in the kitchen of the cabin.  
    Eddie is accepting scraps from Martin and Frasier.  He comes 
    around the table, and Ronee brings him a full turkey on a platter, 
    which she places in front of him on the floor.  He begins to 
    devour it.  The scene fades to the same one that ended Act II, 
    revealing Eddie at Martin's and Ronee's feet, asleep.  Even he 
    gets his turn to have a dream.
