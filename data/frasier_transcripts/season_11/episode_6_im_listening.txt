    **Skyline** : Lightning flashes.
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Apartment
    In the morning, Ronee and Martin are in the living room, wearing their 
    bathrobes and getting breakfast.  Ronee is at the piano._
    [_To the tune of "Good Morning" from "Singing in the Rain."_]
    
      **Ronee:**[_singing_] Good morning, good morning, I'd like a bagel too, 
             and schmear it, with cream cheese, thank you...
    _Martin sways appreciatively, but Frasier comes out in his bathrobe, 
    bleary and irritable._
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, excuse me!  Did it occur to you that some of us 
             might still be trying to sleep?
     **Martin:** Oh, lighten up, Fras, Ronee was just showing me how she can 
             change the lyrics to any song to suit the occasion.
    **Frasier:** Yes, very impressive.  Does she take requests?
     **Martin:** Sure!
    **Frasier:** Stop it!
    _Frasier goes to the table and pours himself coffee._
      **Ronee:** You know what you need, Grumpy?  A nice hot breakfast.  Marty, 
             why don't you get Grumpy here some breakfast?
    **Frasier:** I don't want any breakfast, and please stop calling me that.
    
    [_To the tune of John Denver's "Thank God he's a country boy."_]
    
      **Ronee:**[_singing_] Got me some ham, and some cakes on the griddle/ 
             Whoo!  Good God, he's a grumpy boy!
    _Martin laughs uproariously._
     **Martin:** You see what she just did?
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's mind-boggling.  Listen, Dad, do you mind giving me a 
             ride to work today?  My car is in the shop.
     **Martin:** Again?
    **Frasier:** Well, yeah, my seat-warmer's stuck on high, so I tried to 
             offset it by blasting the air conditioner, which resulted in 
             sort of a fog bank on my dashboard.
      **Ronee:** I can give you a ride, Fras.  I mean, it's just an old Caddy, 
             so there's nothing fancy like butt warmers or seat belts.
    **Frasier:** Fine.  Let me just make sure my will is in order, and I'll be 
             back in a minute.
    _He gets up and dashes to his room._
     **Martin:** Well, I'm going to go take a shower.
    **Frasier:**[_on his way out_] Don't use all the hot water!
     **Martin:** I know.  Gotta leave enough for milady's tub.
      **Ronee:** Oh, that's okay, I can take a shower too.
     **Martin:** I wasn't talking about you.
    _Martin exits.  Ronee's mobile rings, she answers.  As she talks, 
    Frasier re-appears in the hallway, but she doesn't see him._
      **Ronee:** Hello?  Oh, Richard, hi.
    _Hearing this, Frasier ducks behind the wall.  As she turns toward the 
    piano, he hunches closer to hear better._
      **Ronee:** Listen, this really isn't a good time.  I was just heading 
             into a yoga class and... yeah.  No, I would love to have 
             dinner.  That sounds fun.  Okay, I'll see you then, sweetie.
    _As she hangs up, Frasier retreats a step, then makes a loud entrance, 
    as if he just came in._
    **Frasier:** You know, I got two steps in my room and realized I'd 
             forgotten - ah, there it is.
    _He picks up his coffee cup as Ronee sits at the piano again._
    [_To the tune of "There She Is, Miss America"_]
    
      **Ronee:**[_singing_] There it is, Frasier's coffee cup...
    **Frasier:** You are a national treasure. 
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Caf e Nervosa
    Niles is seated at a table, composing a letter.  Frasier comes in.
    _
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Thank God you're here.  Listen, there's something I 
             need to discuss with you.
      **Niles:** Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I'm in the middle of composing a plea 
             to Alfred Antin in the meter of Dr. Seuss.
    **Frasier:** Who?
      **Niles:** Theodore Geisel, the children's author.  You know, "I do not 
             like green eggs and ham/ I do not like them, Sam-I-Am..."
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I know who Dr. Seuss is, you ninny.  Who's the other 
             guy?
      **Niles:** Oh-oh, Alfred Antin.  He's Seattle's premier scenic painter 
             specializing in children's rooms.  His billowing clouds can be 
             seen scudding across the ceilings of the finest nurseries in 
             town, but he's booked solid.  So I thought if I wrote this...
    _He notices Frasier's restless shifting._
      **Niles:** Oh, you've lost interest, haven't you?
    **Frasier:** I was feigning interest to begin with.  Niles, I-I need your 
             advice on something.  Uh, this morning, I-I heard Ronee on the 
             phone make a date with another man.
      **Niles:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** I'm positive.  She was talking to a man, yes, and in honeyed 
             tones.
      **Niles:** Mm...
    **Frasier:** Here's my predicament.  I-I don't want to meddle, but I also 
             don't want to see Dad get hurt.  So, how do you suggest we 
             tell him?
      **Niles:**[_looks up, surprised_] "We?"
    **Frasier:** Yes, "we."
      **Niles:** Don't drag me into this, I don't know a thing about it.
    **Frasier:** You know as much as I do, I just briefed you.
      **Niles:** Well, I didn't want to be briefed.
    **Frasier:** Well, then you should have said something, now you're in as 
             deep as I am!  You can't unscramble an egg, Niles.
      **Niles:** What are you talking about?!
    _Martin enters with a newspaper._
     **Martin:** Oh, boys, boys, boys, I'm glad I caught you.  Did you see 
             this?
      **Niles:**[_reading_] "Doo-wop-alooza"?
     **Martin:** Yeah, one night only.  All the greats of doo-wop: The 
             Coasters, The Platters, and that guy from The Teenagers 
             is back from his hip replacement.
      **Niles:** Wow...
    **Frasier:** Yes...
     **Martin:** Oh, I know you guys aren't interested in modern music, but 
             Ronee would really love it.  I was hoping maybe you could use 
             your connections to maybe score us a couple of seats?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm afraid I'm not very well-connected in the doo-wop 
             world, Dad.  Uh, if there's ever a "Mahler-palooza," I'm your 
             man.
      **Niles:** Dad, I'll ask around. [_gathers his letter_] I have to go.  I'm 
             off to try and win the heart and mind of A. Antin.  I'll go 
             and meet him with my Daphne/ and hope that things don't go 
             ker-phaphne!
    _He shrugs lamely and exits.  Martin sits with Frasier._
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, sorry again about this morning, you know, me and 
             Ronee waking you up.  We were just having a little fun.
    **Frasier:** That's all right.  It's great to have a fling once in a while, 
             isn't it?
     **Martin:** Hey, let me tell you something.  You don't go to Doo-wop-
             alooza with a "fling."
    **Frasier:** I see.
    _Pause.  Frasier looks down._
     **Martin:** You got something you want to say, son?
    **Frasier:** No.
     **Martin:** Fine. [_signals the waiter_]
    **Frasier:** Well, all right, if you insist on dragging it out of me.  
             Something happened this morning, Dad.
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** Well, I was, uh, walking down the hall to retrieve my coffee, 
             and, uh, Ronee was on the phone, and I didn't want to 
             interrupt, so I waited, and I heard her make a... a date with 
             another man.
    _Martin sits back, stunned... and takes it badly._
     **Martin:** So you eavesdropped, huh?
    **Frasier:** No.
     **Martin:** Well, a person's having a private conversation.  You stop and 
             listen - that's eavesdropping!
    **Frasier:** Dad, it was completely by accident.  I understand why you'd be 
             upset, but please don't shoot the messenger.
     **Martin:** Well, the messenger's got it coming if he's a dirty little 
             eavesdropper! You walk into a private conversation, you make 
             your presence known by some subtle way.  You can-can clear 
             your throat- [_clears throat_] you can make a noise- [_hits the 
             table_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, please!
     **Martin:**[_gets up_] You know, just because people call in for your 
             precious pearls of wisdom on the radio, it doesn't give you a 
             free pass to get into everybody's business!  Now I know why 
             you're always saying, "I'm listening" - because you always 
             are!
    _As Martin leaves, two men sitting at the window table share a laugh._
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, I'm glad the two of you found that so amusing, but 
             as you just heard, it is rude to listen in on other people's 
             conversations.
    _The men look at him blankly.  One of them gestures a question in sign 
    language, while the other signs back and mouths, "I have no idea."  
    Both men are deaf.
    
    Chagrined, Frasier exits.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE FIRST OF SHEILA**
    _Scene Three - Apartment
    The doorbell rings.  Frasier answers the door to Niles, then returns to 
    searching the couch cushions._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, come on in.
      **Niles:** Hey, Frasier.  Hi, I'm just here to drop off these Doo-wop-
             alooza tickets for Dad.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, that was good luck, how did you manage it?
      **Niles:** Well, actually, Alfred Antin and his wife are big doo-wop 
             fans, and the couple that was going with them canceled, so-so 
             they let...
    _He trails off, as Frasier repeatedly lifts the couch cushions, looking 
    for something.  Niles lifts one himself._
      **Niles:** They let me have the tickets.  What are we looking for?
    **Frasier:** Well, my money clip.  Have you seen it?
      **Niles:** Rarely.
    _Frasier purses his lips at the implied insult, then keeps looking._
    **Frasier:** I've misplaced it, [_kicks Martin's chair in frustration_] and 
             it's distracting me no end.
      **Niles:** Anyway, Dad was thrilled when I told him I found the tickets.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, I'm glad to hear that.  He was just a bit vexed when 
             he left me earlier this morning.
      **Niles:** Over what...? [_gasps_] Frasier, you told him about Ronee's 
             date!
    **Frasier:** As we agreed!
      **Niles:** "We"?
    **Frasier:** Yes, "we."
      **Niles:** There's no "we!"  There's never been a "we!"
    **Frasier:** Oh, give it up, Niles!  There's blood on both our hands! 
             [_checks his watch_] Oh, gosh, I better go eat something.  I've 
             got my reading in twenty minutes.
      **Niles:** Reading?
    _He follows Frasier to the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I'm, uh, reciting "Annabelle Lee" for the Poe 
             Society this evening.  I-I don't mind telling you, I'm just a 
             bit nervous.
      **Niles:** Oh, don't worry - po' folk don't �spect much.
    _Niles laughs as Frasier gives him a look._
      **Niles:** I had to say that.  Well, I'm off.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    _Niles leaves.  Frasier removes a Chinese takeout carton and opens it 
    for inspection, then staggers at the smell.  He closes it and replaces 
    it in the refrigerator.  At a loss, he takes an apple from the basket 
    and bites into it.
    
    In the living room, Martin and Ronee enter through the front door._
     **Martin:** It's this amazing doo-wop show...
    _Hearing them, Frasier wants to make his presence known, but his mouth 
    is full of apple.  Rather than appear in that condition, he hides 
    behind the kitchen entrance._
     **Martin:**...all the greats, one night only this Sunday.
      **Ronee:** Sunday?  I'm sorry, I-I, I made plans.
     **Martin:** Oh, plans, huh?  Uh... what kind of plans?
    _Frasier swallows, but cannot now come out - he's already heard too much 
    for his presence to seem innocent._
      **Ronee:** Look, Marty, I like you too much to lie to you.  I, I have a 
             date.
     **Martin:** Oh, oh, it's no problem, yeah.  Uh, want a drink?
    _Frasier's eyes widen in horror._
      **Ronee:** Oh no, I better not, I'm working.  Just a beer.
    _Frasier hides behind the range as Martin and Ronee comes in.  Martin 
    gets two beers from the fridge and gives one to her._
      **Ronee:** You're not upset, are you?  I mean, you know, we never really 
             talked about not seeing other people.
     **Martin:** Oh no, it's fine, no, no!  I'm seeing other people too.  
    _Frasier, who was looking scared, now looks indignant._
     **Martin:** Maybe I'll ask, uh... Sheila!  Yeah, she'll be all over this 
             one.  So, uh, how about another night?
      **Ronee:** Yeah, sure.  Um, what about Tuesday?
     **Martin:** Great!
      **Ronee:** Great. [_then_] Wow, I had no idea it was this late.  
    _They exit the kitchen._
      **Ronee:**[_o.s._] So, I'll call you about Tuesday.
    _Frasier rises, and exhales in relief - then ducks as Ronee comes back 
    in.  But she has already noticed him.  Martin follows her back in._
      **Ronee:** Frasier, what are you doing?
    **Frasier:** I didn't know you two were home.  Uh, I was just cleaning the 
             oven, I must have dozed off.
      **Ronee:** Cool.  Well, I gotta run.  Goodnight, you two.
     **Martin:** See ya.
    _He waits until she is gone, then rounds on Frasier._
     **Martin:** You have a disease!
    **Frasier:** Dad, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, let me explain-
     **Martin:** No, there's nothing to explain!  I told you not to eavesdrop 
             and you did it again, you are a very sick person!
    **Frasier:** I tried to announce myself, I had a mouthful of apple 
             rendering me speechless!
     **Martin:** Oh, I was a cop, you think I haven't heard that one before?
    _He storms out of the kitchen, Frasier follows him._
    **Frasier:** You are just angry because I heard you lying to Ronee.  You 
             really expect to win Ronee's heart by inventing fictitious 
             girlfriends?  "Sheila," indeed!
     **Martin:**[_floundering_] It's none of your business, and... you weren't 
             supposed to hear it!
    **Frasier:** Well, I did hear it.
     **Martin:** No, you _overheard_ it.  It's like an illegal wiretap - it's 
             inadmissible!
    _Martin stalks to his room, Frasier follows him._
    **Frasier:** Dad, you cannot build a relationship on lies!
     **Martin:** Inadmissible!
    **Frasier:** Dad!
     **Martin:** IN-ADMISSIBLE!
    **Frasier:** Fine!
    _There is the sound of two doors slamming, Martin's and then Frasier's.
    The powder room door opens - and Niles stiffly comes out, looking very 
    embarrassed.  He exits the apartment.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four - Caf e Nervosa
    Daphne and Niles are seated together at a table.
    _
     **Daphne:** Why can't your father just go to the concert by himself?
      **Niles:** Because Alfred Antin will be offended if we don't use his 
             tickets, and then he won't paint our nursery. [_pleading_] 
             Don't you want to be the one to go with him?
     **Daphne:** Forget it, Niles.  We flipped a coin, and you were the doo-
             wop-a-loser.
    _Martin enters._
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.  Ready to bob-bob-she-bob?
      **Niles:**[_rises in horror_] Oh, dear God.  Is it a dance?  Am I going to 
             have to move about?
     **Martin:** No, you don't have to, but you're going to want to.
      **Niles:**[_one last try_] Daphne?
     **Daphne:** I'm pregnant.
      **Niles:** What does that have to do with it?
     **Daphne:** It's my blanket excuse until the baby is born.  After that, 
             it'll be, "I can't leave the baby."  Get used to it.
    _Martin starts to exit, as Ronee enters with a man.  This is Richard.  
    His hair is also white, but his greater height and lack of a cane are 
    glaringly obvious - at least to Martin._
      **Ronee:** Marty, hi.  
     **Martin:** Ronee, hey.
      **Ronee:** Oh uh, this is Richard. [_introducing_] Martin, Daphne, Niles.
    _They all shake hands, ad-libbing hellos._
    **Richard:** So how do you all know each other?
     **Martin:** Well, uh...
      **Niles:** Ronee was my baby-sitter.  I was a little monster.
    **Richard:**[_to Martin_] And you?
     **Martin:** Um... 
    _Roz enters.  Martin grabs her._
     **Martin:** Sheila!  Where have you been?
    _He embraces her, as she looks bewildered._
     **Martin:** This is my date, Sheila. [_to Roz_] Got stuck at work, huh? [_he 
             says gently nodding his head_]
        **Roz:** Uh, yeah?
     **Martin:** Sheila's a model.  She does all those big auto and RV shows. 
             [_to Roz_] Point to something.
    _Roz opens her hand and motions outward._
      **Ronee:** Wow, impressive.  Nice meeting you. [_steers Richard to the 
             counter_] Let's get ours to go.
    **Richard:** Oh, but I thought...
      **Ronee:** Roll with the punches, Dick.
    _They turn to the counter.  Roz sits with Martin._
        **Roz:** What are you doing?
     **Martin:** I'm trying to make her jealous.  Just go with it.
        **Roz:** But I'm meeting my own date here.
      **Niles:** Dad, the concert starts in fifteen minutes, and Alfred Antin 
             will be very angry if we're late.
     **Martin:** Well, I can't leave unless Sheila comes with me.
        **Roz:** Hello?  Sheila has a date.
      **Niles:** That's it. [_plucks the tickets out of Martin's pocket; to 
             Daphne_] You and I are going.
     **Daphne:**[_groans_] Oh, do we have to?
      **Niles:** Yes. [_gets her up_]
     **Daphne:** Do we really need clouds on the ceiling?  Couldn't we just 
             push the crib closer to the ceiling?
      **Niles:** Why even use a crib?  Let's put him in a pizza box!
    _They exit.  Martin notices Ronee looking their way, and laughs loudly, 
    as though "Sheila" just made a joke._
        **Roz:** Stop it!
     **Martin:** Oh, you - work with me here!
        **Roz:** Okay, okay...
    _She leans in as he kisses her deeply - as her date, Larry, enters._
      **Larry:** Roz?
        **Roz:**[_breaks apart_] Larry, hi.  This is my dad.
    _Martin shakes his hand and ad-libs a hello._
      **Larry:** Hello.  You brought your dad on our date?
        **Roz:** Oh, of course not.  He was just leaving, aren't you, Dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah, but not until I finish my coffee.
        **Roz:**[_looks_] You don't have any coffee.
     **Martin:** Uh, get me one, would you, Larry?
    _Before Larry can do so, Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Dad, what are you doing here?  Hi, Roz. [_sees Larry_] Uh, 
             hello.
      **Larry:** Hi. [_to Roz_] Is your brother joining us too?
        **Roz:** He's not my brother.
     **Martin:** Oh now, that's no way to be. [_she gives him a scalding glare_] 
             Still waiting on that coffee, Lar.
    _Larry turns to the counter.  Frasier, who, after eleven years has lost 
    his ability to be surprised at setups like this, wearily pulls out a 
    chair._
    **Frasier:** Okay, what the hell's going on?
     **Martin:** Nothing.
    _Ronee and Richard get their coffee._
      **Ronee:** Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Ronee.
      **Ronee:** See you, Marty, Sheila.
     **Martin:** Take care, bye.
    _Ronee and Richard exit._
    **Frasier:** So you've been pressed into service as Sheila, hmm?
        **Roz:**[_feels her cheek_] Pressed is right - he nearly bit my lip off.
    _Larry comes back with a cup for Martin._
      **Larry:** Here you go, Mr. Doyle.
     **Martin:** Ah, thanks.
        **Roz:** Come on, Larry, we're leaving.
      **Larry:** It was nice meeting you, Mr. Doyle.  And you can owe me on 
             that coffee - it was $3.75 and I flipped a quarter in the tip 
             jar.
        **Roz:** I'll be home early, Dad.
    _They leave, Roz grimacing as she now knows everything she needs to know
    before her date has begun._
    **Frasier:** Dad, when are you going to stop playing games and tell her how 
             you feel?
     **Martin:** It's too soon.  We've only been seeing each other a few weeks.  
             I don't want to scare her off.  
    **Frasier:** How do you know you're going to scare her off?
     **Martin:** Well, look at her, Fras.  She's young, she's got all these 
             guys after her.  I'm lucky she even gave me a second glance.  
             I don't want to blow it by looking like some desperate old guy 
             with no options.
    **Frasier:** It's not desperate to tell somebody how you feel about them.
     **Martin:** What if she doesn't feel the same way?
    **Frasier:** What if she does and you never find out?
    _Martin has no answer to that._
    **Frasier:** Dad... just give her a call and tell her you want to talk to 
             her.
    _Martin is silent... then lets out a quiet grunt._
    **Frasier:** Was that a "leave me alone" grunt, or a "you've bested me 
             again, son, with your unassailable logic" grunt?
    _Again, Martin is silent, and again lets out a little grunt._
    **Frasier:** I thought so.
    _He folds his arms with a self-satisfied look.

    Scene Five - Apartment
    It's late at night, and Martin is watching TV.  Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Hey, Dad.  What are you watching?
     **Martin:** Sports wrap-up.
    **Frasier:** Sports wrap-up?  Oh, that sounds like fun.
    _Martin looks at him in surprise, as Frasier sits on the couch._
    **Frasier:**[_watching_] Oof! [_chuckles_] Oh, gosh, that's not very 
             sportsmanlike.
     **Martin:**[_realizing_] I called her, okay?  Not that it's any of your 
             business.
    **Frasier:** So?
     **Martin:**[_turns off the TV_] I left a message.  I'm glad she wasn't 
             there, I don't know what I'll say if she calls back.
    **Frasier:** Well, you did the right thing, Dad.  I am proud of you.
     **Martin:** I don't know.  The whole thing's making me nervous.  You know, 
             I know why she's not calling me back.  She just doesn't know 
             how to tell me she's dropping me for Richard.
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier gets up to answer it._
    **Frasier:** Well, who said anything about dropping you?
     **Martin:** No one, apparently, or you would have overheard it.
    _Frasier makes a little "well, right" gesture, then opens the door to 
    Ronee._
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Ronee.
      **Ronee:** Hi, Frasier.
    _Martin rises in surprise._
     **Martin:** Ronee, I didn't expect to see you tonight.
      **Ronee:** Well, I got your message, and I was in the neighborhood.  So, 
             what's up?
    _Martin opens his mouth - and looks at Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh... I was just heading out.  
      **Ronee:** What, at this hour?  I never thought you were such a night 
             owl.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I love clubbin'.
    _Frasier grabs his car keys and exits._
     **Martin:** I-I thought you'd just call.
      **Ronee:** Well, you know, I was going to, but it sounded like maybe we 
             needed to talk face-to-face.
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    _Pause._
      **Ronee:** Marty, is this about that woman I saw you with tonight?
     **Martin:** Well... kind of.
      **Ronee:** Yeah, I thought so.  
    _Another pause - when we can see, though Martin cannot, that Ronee is 
    afraid she's about to be dumped._
      **Ronee:** Look, whatever it is, why don't you just come out and say it?
     **Martin:** Yeah, all right.  Well, um... I'm not the kind of guy who... 
             hey, you want a beer?
      **Ronee:** Oh boy, do I need one?
     **Martin:**[_heading to the kitchen_] No, I think we could both use one.
    _He heads into the kitchen.  The doorbell rings._
     **Martin:**[_from the kitchen_] Oh, would you get that?  Frasier probably 
             forgot his key.
      **Ronee:** Yeah, sure.
    _She opens the door to - Roz!_
      **Ronee:** Oh, Sheila.  I kind of thought your date was over.
    _Roz doesn't know she's not supposed to be acting anymore._
        **Roz:** Well... maybe it is... [_sultry_] maybe it isn't.
      **Ronee:** Gotcha.  Uh, just tell Marty: message received.
        **Roz:**[_not getting it_] Okay.
    _Ronee leaves.  Martin comes back in with two beers._
     **Martin:** Hey Roz, what are you doing here?
        **Roz:** I found Frasier's money clip. [_holds it up_] Is he home?
     **Martin:** No, uh-huh. [_looks around_] Where's Ronee?
        **Roz:** Oh, don't worry. [_"points" to the door_] "Sheila" showed Ronee 
             the door.
     **Martin:** What?! [_rushes to the door_] What the hell did you do that 
             for?!
        **Roz:**[_after him_] Hey, I have no control over what Sheila does.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - Parking Garage
    Frasier is walking toward his car in the garage, talking on his mobile._
    **Frasier:** Oh good, Niles, you're back.  How was the concert?  Well, 
             you're the one who wanted that cloud mural.  I'm sure Pope 
             Julius had to jump through similar hoops to get Michelangelo 
             to paint his ceiling.
    _He stops when he sees Ronee's car, a red Cadillac coupe._
    **Frasier:** Dear God, I think I've just realized where I must have dropped 
             my money clip - Ronee's car.  She gave me a ride in it the day 
             I lost it. [_looks closer_] Well, that's irresponsible of her.  
             She's left it open.
    _He opens the passenger door to look inside.  A man approaches - the 
    owner of the car parked next to Ronee's._
        **Man:** Excuse me?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, of course.
    _Frasier gets into Ronee's car and closes the door to allow the other 
    man into his car._
    **Frasier:** There we are.
        **Man:** Thank you.
    _As the man drives off, Frasier stays in Ronee's car, looking on the 
    floor and continuing to talk into his phone._
    **Frasier:** Anyway, I thought I'd swing by and take us both out for a 
             nightcap.  All right, great.  
    _Not finding his clip, he climbs into the back seat._
    **Frasier:** Oh, by the way, Niles, I spoke with Dad, and he has taken our 
             advice about talking things over with Ronee.  Mine and yours, 
             that's what I mean by "our!"  Oh, take some responsibility for 
             once in your life, man!
    _Outside, Ronee is stalking to her car, as Martin runs after her.  
    Hearing them coming, Frasier panics, trapped again._
      **Ronee:** You could have at least warned me that Sheila was on her way 
             up!
     **Martin:** Ronee, it's all a misunderstanding-
      **Ronee:** Marty, I really don't want to hear it!
     **Martin:** Well, you're going to hear it, because I'm not leaving!
    _She ignores him and opens her door._
     **Martin:** Fine, just get in the car if you want to. [_opens the passenger 
             door and gets in beside her_] We're just going to sit right 
             here until you hear it all.
    _As they get in and shut the doors, Frasier has no choice but to huddle 
    on the floor._
      **Ronee:** Okay, go ahead.  But you better make it good, because I have a 
             finely tuned crap-ometer.
     **Martin:** There is no Sheila.  Her name's Roz.  She's Frasier's 
             secretary.  I just pretended we were together.
      **Ronee:** Forget it, Marty.
     **Martin:** No, I know how this sounds, but it's true.
      **Ronee:** Why would you do that?
     **Martin:** Because I had gotten these concert tickets to impress you, 
             and then when you said you had a date, I got... well, I got 
             jealous so I said I was getting a date too, and then there you 
             were in Nervosa, and when Roz came in, I made her Sheila. 
             [_pause_] Do you believe me?
      **Ronee:** You know, it's actually a little hot.
    _In the back, Frasier is shocked._
     **Martin:**[_grinning_] Really? [_then_] Look, Ronee, uh, maybe I'm old-
             fashioned, but I know when something feels right.  I don't 
             want to see anybody else.  I want to be exclusive, go steady, 
             whatever they call it now.  Well, that's my story.  What about 
             you?
      **Ronee:**[_sighs_] Well... God, it's freezing in here!  I had a blanket.
    _Frasier's eyes widen in horror again.  As she reaches blindly into the 
    backseat, he hurriedly gropes around for the blanket, and passes it 
    into her hand._
    [_N.B. See[[2.17]](/frasier/transcripts/season_2/episode_17/daphnes_room.html "Daphne's Room"), "Daphne's Room" for a similar predicament._]	
    _Ronee wraps herself in the blanket._
      **Ronee:** Okay.  Since we're being honest, well, I-I've done my share of 
             dating, and I haven't always made the best choices.  I've 
             dated the bad guys, the guys who can't commit, the guys who 
             won't grow up, the creeps with the nice suit, the pathological 
             liars...
     **Martin:** Okay, I got it.
      **Ronee:** Anyway, and then I started dating this really good guy - you.
    _He beams at her._
      **Ronee:** And I guess I-I just wanted to keep my options open with 
             Richard because I wasn't sure how you felt about me.  But now 
             I am.
    _They lean into each other and kiss.  Frasier dares to stick his head 
    up, but they do not notice him._
      **Ronee:** Now would be the time to put your class ring on a chain around 
             my neck.
     **Martin:**[_playfully_] Well, I got one upstairs.  Want to come get it?
    _They get out of the car.  Frasier sighs in relief and sits up in the 
    backseat, starting to work out how to get out..._
      **Ronee:** Wait, wait...
    _Frasier freezes as Martin and Ronee talk to each other over the hood of 
    the car._
      **Ronee:** I've got a better idea.  I know this secluded beach that's 
             miles away from anything.  You want to go there and steam up 
             the windows?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah.
    _Frasier has no choice but to duck down again.  As they get back in and 
    Ronee starts the car, he buries his face as deep as possible.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    Roz and her date are in Nervosa.  As they are finishing and get the 
    check, he pulls out a calculator and starts to split the bill.  Roz 
    makes up an excuse to leave the table, and she begins to sneak out.  As 
    she approaches the door, she looks back on him, still puzzling over how 
    to split the bill.  She waves her hand at him dismissively and exits.
