## Crock Einen Stuhl

    
    
    In the Season Ten Finale, "A New Position For Roz," Frasier planned 
    to take his date (the now-departed Julia Wilcox) to a showing of "Noch 
    Einen Stuhl," an old foreign film about the story of a 19th-century 
    Austrian family as told from the perspective of one of their pieces of 
    furniture.
    
    This episode seems directly based on this premise, which has also been 
    re-used many other times in drama -- using an inanimate object to trace 
    a historical thread.  
    
    Another possible influence is the Seinfeld episode "The Betrayal" which 
    was told as a series of flashbacks in reverse order: starting with the 
    end-of-show disaster and rolling back to the peachy beginning.  This
    episode was in turn probably influenced by British playwright Harold
    Pinter's "Betrayal," which used the same out-of-order narrative.
    
    It not only makes for some great comedic and dramatic moments, it is an 
    ingenious way of looking back at the series without just doing a clip 
    show -- they've done one already, they're doing another one before the 
    finale, and besides, that's how ALL television shows try to end.
    
    What's fascinating to watch is how the producer's capture the "look" of 
    previous seasons with more than just the odd reference to a contextual 
    event -- pay close attention, and you'll see: hairstyles change, 
    characters' clothes have an identifiable season, and even their voices
    are different.  In particular, David Hyde Pierce's nasal impression of
    himself in Season One gives you an idea of how different Niles is now.
    
    The retrospective also note how certain gags or varieties of humor were
    staples of early seasons, but were finally left behind as being worn out:
    Eddie's staring, for example, or the badinage between Roz and Niles.

## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    **Skyline:** Fireworks explode.
    
    _ACT ONE_
    **CROCK TALES**
    _Scene One -- Frasier's Apartment -- Kitchen -- PRESENT DAY
    Frasier is cooking a full-course dinner on the stove, stirring 
    something with one hand and talking on his cordless phone with 
    the other._
    _
    **Frasier:** Yeah, I had a great time today too, Charlotte.  Oh nothing, 
             really.  I'm having the folks over for dinner.  Just the 
             family, and Roz.  Well, I've done it a thousand times before.
             Okay, I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.  Bye.
    _He hangs up the phone and reaches for a small, reddish earthenware 
    vessel on the counter, which is holding his kitchen spoons and a 
    spatula.  He picks it up by its rim, which breaks off in his hand.  
    He sighs and gathers up the spoons and the pieces._
    **Frasier:** For God's sake... this thing breaks like crockwork. [_laughs to 
             himself_] Crockwork, I'll tell you... ah Frasier, once again 
             you've suffered the tragedy of being clever, and alone.
    _He prepares to toss the pieces into the garbage, then stops, looking 
    thoughtful.  The camera zooms in on the crock in his hand...
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Living Room
    And fades in on the crock on the dinner table, as Martin is patching it 
    up with glue.
    
    SUPRA: "2003"
    
    Frasier comes out of the kitchen with wine glasses.  He begins to set 
    the table._
    **Frasier:** Oh for God's sake, Dad, would you please throw that thing 
             away?
     **Martin:** Why, what for?  When I get through gluing it, it'll be as good 
             as new.
    _The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** It wasn't any good when it was new!  It's just an ugly, 
             worthless pot.
    _Martin goes to the kitchen.  Frasier answers the door to Daphne._
     **Daphne:** Hello!
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi! [_kisses her cheek and hugs her_] How was the honeymoon?
     **Daphne:** Oh, Tahiti was absolute paradise -- except for poor Niles 
             getting sunburned.
    _Niles staggers in.  His face is beet red, and - judging by his ginger
    movements - so is the rest of him._
    **Frasier:** Oh dear, Niles.  You look like you've crawled out of a bisque.
      **Niles:** And you look like someone who doesn't want his Paul Gauguin 
             souvenir oven mitt.
    _He takes it out of his shopping bag, and Frasier accepts it gratefully._
    **Frasier:** Niles, you remembered.
    _Martin comes out with a beer._
     **Martin:** Hey guys, welcome back!
     **Daphne:** Oh hello, Martin.
      **Niles:** Hey.
    _Daphne notices that Frasier is wearing a blazer._
     **Daphne:** You're a bit dressed up for a family dinner.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, Roz is dropping by with someone she wanted me to 
             meet.
      **Niles:** Ooh, a lady friend?
    **Frasier:** No, we're going to form a jazz trio, Niles.  Of course it's a 
             lady friend, you cherry-faced fool.
     **Martin:** So you want us to clear out?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, you don't have to do that.  If I don't like her, 
             Roz will just take her away.  We've agreed upon a safety 
             word: _enchant e_.  If circumstances should dictate, all I have 
             to do is say it, and Roz will know that I'm not interested.
    _The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** Niles, would you mind getting that?  That's probably Roz.
             Uh, I'm just going to get rid of Dad's arts and crafts project 
             here, all right?
    _Frasier gathers the crock and Martin's supplies and goes back to 
    the kitchen.  Niles opens the door to Roz and her friend, Lisbeth._
      **Niles:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh hi - hey, you guys are back!  Hey, Martin.
     **Martin:** Roz.
        **Roz:** This is my friend Lisbeth.
    **Lisbeth:** Hiya.
    _She shakes Niles' hand, then draws back as he winces in pain.  He waves 
    it off and ushers the two women in.  They sit on the couch._
    [_N.B. During the creation of the show eleven years ago, the writers originally 
    conceived of Martin's home health care worker being a sassy Hispanic, with 
    Rosie Perez in mind for the role; Jane Leeves was cast only after they changed 
    their minds and made the character an Englishwoman.  Perez's appearance here 
    is perhaps a nod to that forgotten idea._]
    
    [_N.B.B. Perez also voiced the guest caller Francesca in[[2.12]](/frasier/transcripts/season_2/episode_12/roz_in_the_doghouse.html "Roz In The Doghouse"), "Roz in 
    the Doghouse."_]
    
      **Niles:** Yes, come in, this is Daphne and Martin, and, yes... can I get 
             you a glass of wine?
        **Roz:** Oh, please! [_to her_] Frasier has the greatest wine.
    **Lisbeth:** Oh, sounds good to me.  Life's too short to drink bad wine, 
             right?
      **Niles:**[_pleased_] Amen to that!
    **Lisbeth:** Just a half a glass, with club soda. [_to Roz_] You know how I 
             love my spritzer.
    _Niles turns toward the kitchen.  If he could say "enchant e" for Frasier, 
    he would.
    _
      **Niles:** Frasier?
    _Frasier comes out._
    **Frasier:** What...? [_feigning surprise_] Oh, hi!  Roz, what a pleasant 
             surprise.
    _The two women stand._
        **Roz:** This is Lisbeth.  We were just shopping in the neighborhood, 
             and thought we'd stop by.
    **Frasier:** Well, how lovely. [_shakes her hand_] It's a pleasure to meet 
             you, Elizabeth.
    **Lisbeth:** It's not Elizabeth, it's "Lisbeth."
    **Frasier:** Ah, like Lisbon!
    **Lisbeth:** Like a what?
    **Frasier:**_Enchant e_. [_glances at Roz_]
    **Lisbeth:** Right, and meeting you was just... super.
    _She also glances at Roz, who looks guilty as Frasier glares at her.
    They still haven't dropped their hands._
    **Frasier:** Yes, the feeling is mutual. [_at Roz_] _Enchant e, enchante, 
             enchante._
    **Lisbeth:** Oh, and for me it's just been super. [_at Roz_] Super, super!
        **Roz:** I took a shot.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    **Lisbeth:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Well, I guess we can stop shaking hands now.
    **Lisbeth:** Oh well, I'm ready whenever you are.
    **Frasier:** Well, then just let go.
    **Lisbeth:** I did, you're holding on to me.
    **Frasier:** What...?  Oh, dear.  Dad, what kind of glue were you using on 
             that pot?
     **Martin:**[_sighs_] Super.
    **Lisbeth:** How could you be so stupid as to glue us together?! [_to Roz_] 
             I thought you said he was smart!
      **Niles:** Don't panic, I-I seem to recall that-that Superglue can be 
             dissolved with acetone -- you know, nail polish remover.
     **Daphne:** He's the smart one.  How did you know that?
      **Niles:** I knew that from, uh... from school.
    **Frasier:** School lunches!  The Kriezel brothers used to glue a cafeteria 
             tray to his tie.
    
    [_N.B. He would also know from[[2.21]](/frasier/transcripts/season_2/episode_21/an_affair_to_forget.html "An Affair To Forget"), "An Affair to Forget," 
    when Daphne unstuck a piece of a model ship from his hand._]
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I suppose we'd better get some.  Let's go to the drug 
             store.
    _She picks up her purse and Niles follows her out._
    **Lisbeth:** Drug store?  Oh, I gotta go.
    **Frasier:** No, no, they'll be back in ten minutes.
    **Lisbeth:** No, no, no, I gotta _go_.  I started the new juice diet, and 
             I got sixty-four ounces of cran-raspberry looking for a new 
             home.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake.  All right, I'll tell you what, uh, just, 
             uh, here, just come right in here, there you are...
    _Martin and Roz watch, fascinated but disturbed, as Frasier opens the 
    powder room door and maneuvers Lisbeth inside, keeping his back turned 
    to her._
    **Frasier:** All right, just a moment, uh...
    _He closes the door with his face wedged between it and the jam, with 
    his arm behind him and keeping his gaze fixed on the living room._
    **Frasier:** Are you there?
    **Lisbeth:**[_from inside_] Almost.
    _Frasier slides his face down the doorjamb, hunching over to let Lisbeth 
    move._
    **Lisbeth:** That's close enough.  Could you maybe put on some music?
    **Frasier:** Dad, could you put on some music, please?
     **Martin:** Yeah, sure.  Uh, what do want, pop, big band-?
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, just turn the damn thing on!
    _Martin does.
    
    FADE OUT_
    [_N.B. This scene would have taken place sometime after Niles and Daphne's 
    marriage at the beginning of Season Ten, with[[11.01]](/frasier/transcripts/season_11/episode_1/no_sex_please_were_skittish.html "No Sex Please, We're Skittish"), "The Ring Cycle."  
    However, that would have been in 2002, so apparently they didn't take
    their honeymoon until much later._]
    _Scene Three - Living Room
    It is evening.  Frasier opens the door to Roz.
    
    SUPRA: "2002"_
    [_N.B. Roz's attire, a leather skirt and high boots, suggests her "post-
    Alice" phase, when her social life had slowed down considerably but she 
    wasn't ready to acknowledge it._]
    
        **Roz:** Sorry I'm late.  The Cinco de Mayo traffic was _muy malo_.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, that's right, they closed some streets for the 
             fireworks display.  Well, happy birthday, Roz.
    _Daphne and Martin are also there._
     **Daphne:** Yeah, happy birthday.
        **Roz:** Whatever. [_sinks onto the couch_] Used to be I'd go out and get 
             a little wild on my birthday.  Now I go out and get a little 
             dinner.
    **Frasier:** There's nothing wrong with dinner.
        **Roz:** I know, but it used to come with sex.
    _Daphne comes over and pulls Roz to her feet._
     **Daphne:** Oh, come on, Roz, sounds like you need a drink.
        **Roz:**[_wistful_] Oh, that used to come with sex, too.
    _Daphne takes her to the kitchen._
     **Martin:** Sounds like we got another passenger on the S.S. _Ain't Getting 
             Any._
    _The doorbell rings again, and Frasier opens it to Niles._
      **Niles:** Hello!  
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Wonderful day, marvelous day, you two look grand, where's 
             Daphne?
     **Martin:** Who shoved a bluebird into you?
    **Frasier:** You know the S.S. _Ain't Getting Any_?  Man overboard.
     **Martin:**[_shocked_] You and Daphne?
      **Niles:** Last night, Daphne and I engaged in sweet carnal delights.
     **Martin:**[_uneasy_] Did you say "carnal" or "caramel"?
    _Niles looks embarrassed.  Martin gets up._
     **Martin:** I'd better go wrap Roz's birthday gift. [_exits_]
      **Niles:** Oh!  I forgot about Roz's birthday.  You don't have anything 
             I could give her, do you?
    _Frasier stoops and rummages through his bookshelf._
    **Frasier:** Well, let's look, maybe one of these books... [_straightens up_] 
             For God's sake, Niles!  I mean, how could you forget her 
             birthday?  It's the whole reason we're having dinner.
      **Niles:** Well, forgive me, I've been a little distracted lately.  
             Especially last night!  And again this morning. [_then_] 
             Oh, dear God, if Daphne knew I was speaking so indiscreetly, 
             she'd be mortified.
    _SMASH CUT TO: Kitchen
    Daphne is regaling a bewildered Roz with her own boudoir stories.  
    Both women have wine._
     **Daphne:**...and just when I thought I'd worn him out, he flips me over 
             like a griddle cake, and off we go again!
        **Roz:** Niles?
     **Daphne:** I couldn't catch me breath, it was like a marathon!  I tell 
             you, he's spoilt me for any other man.
        **Roz:** Frasier's brother Niles?
     **Daphne:** And guess how he woke me up this morning? [_giggles_]
        **Roz:** Oh, shut up already!
    _Reset to: Living Room
    The ladies come out of the kitchen as Martin enters with a gift box.
    Niles has something in a gift bag now._
    **Frasier:** Okay, birthday girl, come on over here and open some gifts.
    _Niles and Daphne catch sight of each other._
      **Niles:** Hello.
     **Daphne:** Hello yourself.
    _They grin._
    **Frasier:** All right, you two, let's pay attention.  This is Roz's 
             birthday.  This gift is from Niles.
      **Niles:** Happy birthday, Roz.
    _As Roz opens the bag and unwraps what's inside, Niles and Daphne
    keep grinning at each other.  Roz reveals -- the crock.
    _
        **Roz:** It's a crock.  With a chipped lid. [_lifts the lid and looks 
             inside_] And a dead bee.  Thank you, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_his mind completely elsewhere_] Glad you like it.
     **Daphne:**[_her mind in the same place_] Oh, you know, I-I think I left 
             your present in my room.  Niles, will you help me with it?
      **Niles:** Oh, of course.  
    _They almost run to the hallway._
      **Niles:** We'll be back very quickie.
     **Daphne:** Quickly!
      **Niles:** Quickly.
    _They exit._
     **Martin:** You don't think they're gonna...?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I have no idea.  Try not to think about it.
    _They stand around uncomfortably.  Then behind them, the skyline 
    lights up as fireworks explode all over._
        **Roz:** Wow, he really is good.
    
    [_N.B. 2002 means the second half of Season Nine and the first half of 
    Season Ten -- although the goofy smile that Niles wears for most of this 
    scene is much like the one he wore after he and Daphne first slept 
    together in [[8.19]](/frasier/transcripts/season_8/episode_19/daphne_returns.html "Daphne Returns"), "Daphne Returns."_]
    
    [_N.B.B. This gag is also an obvious tribute to Hitchcock's "To Catch A 
    Thief," in which the male and female leads fall onto a couch, kissing,
    and the camera shifts up to show fireworks going off._]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Living Room
    It is mid-morning.  Martin is watching a baseball game on TV.
    
    SUPRA: "1999"
    
    Frasier comes out dressed as Uncle Sam: bright red-white-and-blue 
    pantaloons, jacket and top hat, and a silvery wig and goatee - even 
    his eyebrows are silver and bushy.  He picks up a pair of remote 
    headphones off the credenza.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dad, I bought you these headphones, so that I wouldn't be 
             subjected to your sports drivel.  Please put them on.
     **Martin:** All right, I will.  But only if you say it. 
    _Frasier sighs and points his finger like the old World War II
    recruiting poster._
    **Frasier:** I WANT _YOU_ -- to wear those headphones!
    _Martin laughs.  Frasier goes into the kitchen._
     **Martin:** I don't know why you care, you're just going to be out riding 
             on that stupid parade float.
    **Frasier:**[_o.s., from the kitchen_] The KACL Fourth of July float is 
             not stupid! [_comes out_] Unless you think it is stupid to 
             commemorate a hardy band of revolutionaries, their minds 
             ablaze with...
     **Martin:**[_puts on the headphones_] Hey, you're right, this does cut out 
             all the drivel!
    _Daphne comes out, wearing a comically mismatched outfit: patchwork 
    pants, a white striped shirt, and a powder-blue suit jacket._
    **Frasier:** Oh hey, Daph.  My God, you look hideous.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.  Now I wouldn't normally wear polyester on the 
             hottest day of the year, but some English friends of mine 
             are having an Ugly American party in honor of the Fourth.
    _The doorbell rings.  As Frasier goes to answer it, Daphne drops into 
    the drag-queen American accent that she used in[[4.19]](/frasier/transcripts/season_4/episode_19/three_dates_and_a_break_up_1.html "Three Dates And A Break Up \[1\]"), "Three Dates 
    and a Breakup[1]."
    _
     **Daphne:** We're gonna toss back a couple a' cold brewskis, watch the 
             ball game, and not use the metric system.
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] That's very funny.
    _He opens the door to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Oh hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, Uncle Sam.  Didn't you just hand me a flyer for a 
             mattress sale?
    **Frasier:** Uh, listen, Roz is running a little late, so we're just gonna 
             meet her downstairs, all right?  Dad!
    _Martin doesn't hear, so Daphne taps him on the shoulder._
    **Frasier:**[_waving goodbye_] We're off!  See you later!
     **Martin:**[_takes off the headphones_] Oh, okay, good luck!  Boy, 
             these are great.  Now I can watch TV without bugging 
             anybody.
    _He rises and goes to the kitchen, putting the headphones back on._
     **Martin:**[_suddenly singing, loudly_] 
             My bacon, is Farmer Frank's bacon!
             There's no mistakin', the quality...
    _Frasier and Niles shrug, then Frasier's glance drifts to the red-white-and-
    blue drapes on his balcony._
    **Frasier:** Wait a minute.  Is my bunting a-droop?  It's supposed to drape 
             evenly -- oh, for God's sakes.
     **Daphne:**[_groans_] You're not going to send me back to the Space Needle 
             with binoculars and a walkie-talkie again, are you?
    **Frasier:** No, there's no time for that.  We can fix it on the fly.    
             It'll just take a second.
    _Reset to: Balcony
    He leads Niles and Daphne out to the balcony._
    **Frasier:** Here, Niles, grab that end.
    _Daphne closes the door behind them -- and the handle comes off in her
    hand.
    _
     **Daphne:** Excuse me?  This shouldn't come off like this, should it?
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.  Um... here. [_tries the other door; it's also
             locked_] Oh, lord.
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Martin comes back into the living room with a bowl of chips.  He 
    doesn't hear or see Frasier, Niles, and Daphne waving frantically 
    and yelling "Dad!" "Mr. Crane!" etc.  He puts them down on the side 
    table and goes back into the kitchen.
    
    Reset to: Balcony_
      **Niles:** He can't hear us.  We're stuck out here, what are we gonna do?
    **Frasier:** All right, let's not panic.  You know what, maybe some of our 
             neighbors are out on their balconies, we'll just call out to 
             them.
    _They start yelling to the balconies above and below them.
    
    Reset to: Living Room
    Roz comes in the front door wearing a red-and-white polka-dotted 
    Betsy Ross costume._
        **Roz:** Hello?  Hello?
    _She looks out and sees the three of them on the balcony, waving and
    yelling excitedly.  She also hears the roar of jet engines outside._
        **Roz:** The Blue Angels!
    _Reset to: Balcony
    She runs out onto the balcony.  The scream of a passing jet drowns out 
    the sound of the door being opened, and fades just in time to let them
    hear it close again._
        **Roz:** Wow!
    _As Roz looks eagerly skyward, the other three look at her, then at the 
    door, then at her again._
        **Roz:** What?
      **Niles:** Locked-Out!
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Martin comes back in with the crock, which he sets next to the chips.  
    Now all four of them are yelling and waving, with Roz adding "Martin!" 
    to "Dad!" and "Mr. Crane!" Again, he doesn't notice and sits in his 
    chair to watch the game._
    **Frasier:** Roz, how long does a baseball match last?
        **Roz:** Well, usually three hours, but...
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.
    _Niles groans and sits in one of the deck chairs as the other three
    stand in front of him at the balcony._
        **Roz:** This sucks, I don't even have my cell phone.  Don't you have 
             your cell phone, Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Roz, I'm Uncle Sam, I don't have a cell phone.  I shouldn't 
             even have this zipper.
     **Daphne:** It's going to be a hundred degrees out here, I'm roasting in 
             these things!
    _Niles, who has been searching his pockets, finds his cell phone.
    He excitedly steps forward, holding it up-_
     **Daphne:** That's it, these clothes are coming off.
    _-and quickly buries it in his jacket as Daphne sheds her jacket, drops 
    her belt, and starts to unbutton her shirt._
    [_N.B. 1999 means the second half of Season Six, and the first half
    of Season Seven.  Daphne's pageboy haircut indicates that this is 
    Season Six -- although it should be noted that when they are yelling
    at Frasier's neighbors, she yells "Mr. Winston, are you home?"  Cam
    Winston was not referred to until Season Seven, but might well have
    moved into Frasier's building long before._]

    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Five -- Living Room
    Evening.  Frasier and Niles are on the couch, and Frasier pours Niles 
    a glass of wine.  Niles is very depressed, and more than a little drunk.
    
    SUPRA: "1998"
    
    The phone rings, and Niles starts to get up.
    _
    **Frasier:** That's all right, Niles, allow me. [_calls_] Daphne!
    _Daphne comes out of the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** Coming! [_answers the phone_] Hello, Crane residence.  Oh hello, 
             Mum, Happy Thanksgiving.  Yeah, it's the holiday where everyone 
             eats turkey.  No, we're having goose.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, when you're finished with that, could you please bring 
             us some snacks to soak up this wine?
      **Niles:** Yes, and a little more wine.  Who knew my sorrows would be 
             such strong swimmers?
    _Daphne carries the phone to the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** I can't talk right now, Mum.  Dr. Crane has guests.  Yeah, 
             he's still out of work.
    _Reset to: Kitchen
    Daphne comes in and lays out some snacks and another bottle of wine.
    The crock is sitting on the snack tray._
     **Daphne:** Of course I'm worried he might let me go.  I worry about it 
             every day.  But I'm coping.
    _She drains her own glass of wine.
    
    Reset to: Living Room
    Roz comes out with a baby bag._
        **Roz:** Alice is so cute.  She fell asleep hugging her bottle.
    _Niles is slumped against the couch arm, cradling the wine bottle._
      **Niles:** I'm right behind her.
    **Frasier:** Niles, will you please stop being so morose?  It is Thanksgiving.
      **Niles:** Oh, you're right!  I should count my blessings: I'm in the 
             midst of a bitter divorce; Maris is freezing my assets, 
             forcing me to live in the Shangri-La, which is the devil's 
             own apartment complex -- where last night they turned off my 
             heat, re-freezing my assets!
    _He claps his hands sarcastically._
    **Frasier:** We're all going through a bit of a rough patch.  Look at Roz 
             and me, we're out of a job.
        **Roz:** Oh, not me.  I just took a phone temp job in customer service.  
             I can work from wherever I am, they just patch the calls 
             through.
    **Frasier:** Well, now you see?  There's a positive attitude!
    _Daphne comes out of the kitchen in time to hear:_
    **Frasier:** Some people see losing a job as an opportunity! [_Daphne brings
             the snacks_] Oh, thank you.
    _Daphne retreats into the kitchen, looking worried.  Roz's cell phone
    rings._
        **Roz:** Hello? [_sexy voice_] Oh, hello.  Yes, this is Monique.
    _Frasier and Niles are shocked._
        **Roz:** I'm just lying in the tub, soaping myself all over...
    **Frasier:** Good heavens, Roz!  Is that the sort of customer you're 
             servicing?!  Hang that up!
        **Roz:** Call me later, Tiger, okay? [_hangs up; normal voice_] What? 
             It pays the bills, and I'm not tied to a desk.
    **Frasier:** Not unless they ask you to be!
    _Niles' spirits lift enough for him to snigger.  Martin comes out._
     **Martin:** Well, good news, the Cowboys just scored.  Bad news is, 
             I kinda screamed and woke somebody's baby up.
    _Roz gasps and runs to the hallway.  Daphne comes out again._
    **Frasier:** Oh Daphne, my bath salts man has just delivered a new 
             shipment of my proprietary blend -- could you please 
             run me a tub tonight?
     **Daphne:**[_sweetly_] Oh, of course I will, Dr. Crane. [_comes and refills 
             their wine glasses_] What would you do without me? [_to Niles_] 
             A little more?  
    _She notices his sad face._
     **Daphne:** I know things have been tough lately, but they'll turn around 
             for you. [_caresses his cheek_] Just watch.
    _She goes to the kitchen again.  Niles, dumbstruck, feels his cheek
    as if blessed._
      **Niles:** She's an angel.  You're right, Frasier.  I'm being too morose.  
             I'm not taking action. [_gets up_] I'm telling Daphne I love 
             her, tonight!
    **Frasier:**[_grabs him_] Niles, let's not be rash.  Come on, come on, 
             let's get you some fresh air.
      **Niles:** I don't want air, I want Daphne!
    _Frasier pulls him out to the balcony.  Roz's cell phone rings.  Martin
    looks around, sees he is alone, and gets up to answer it._
     **Martin:** Hello?
    _Long pause, while Martin gets a confused look._
     **Martin:** Well, thank you, you've got a nice, deep voice too. [_looks 
             more confused_] Uh -- oh, I don't know. [_looks down_] Uh, brown 
             pants and a plaid shirt - Hello?  Hello?
    _He shrugs and hangs up.  Roz comes out and sees Niles yelling and 
    gesturing wildly at Frasier._
        **Roz:** Is everything all right?  What's wrong with Niles?
    _Daphne sticks her head out and hears:_
     **Martin:** He decided that today's the day he's going to tell Daphne.
        **Roz:** He's gonna tell Daphne with all of us here?  That's gonna be 
             uncomfortable.
     **Martin:** I know, but I guess he figures he just can't afford to wait 
             any longer.
    _Daphne retreats again.  Frasier pulls Niles back in._
    **Frasier:** All right, Niles -- [_Niles breaks away_] Niles, Niles, please!
    _Daphne runs out._
      **Niles:**[_passionately_] Daphne...!
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, I know what you're going to do!
      **Niles:** You do?!
     **Daphne:** Not you, Dr. Crane -- Dr. Crane!  And you can't fire me, 
             because I quit!
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Daphne:** After all I've done to save you money!  I'm washing my face 
             with dish soap while you're out buying imported bath salts 
             like a big rich girl!  _I hope you rot in debtors' prison!_
    _She storms to her room._
    [_N.B. GREAT delivery by Jane Leeves on that last line._]
    
      **Niles:** She's an angel!
    
    [_N.B. The year 1998, and the specific circumstances referred to fix this 
    episode at somewhere just after[[6.07]](/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_7/how_to_bury_a_millionaire.html "How To Bury A Millionaire"), "How to Bury a Millionaire," when 
    Niles was at a low point.  Also, a slight discontinuity here -- Roz was 
    not aware of Niles' feelings for Daphne until [[6.16]](/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_16/decoys.html "Decoys") "Decoys," much later 
    in Season Six, after she and Frasier had gotten their jobs back._]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- Living Room
    Morning.  Frasier sees a woman to the elevator.
    
    SUPRA: "1996"
    _
    **Frasier:** I'll pick you up at seven, my angel.
    _He turns around with a moonstruck smile.  Daphne and Martin are seated 
    at the dining table._
    **Frasier:** You'd better get used to the name "Evelyn Griebel," because 
             you're going to be hearing an awful lot of it around here.  
             Evelyn Griebel -- sounds like music, doesn't it?
     **Daphne:** Haven't you only been dating her a week?
    **Frasier:** Well yes, and you know how loath I am to use the expression 
             "she may be the one," but I think in this case it's 
             appropriate.
    _Both Daphne and Martin have a weary look on their faces -- they know
    he's setting himself up for a fall, and know how useless it is to
    try and tell him.  Niles comes out of the hallway in a huff.
    _
      **Niles:** I finally got Maris calmed down.  I hope you're happy.
    **Frasier:** All I said was, "Maris, why the long face?"
      **Niles:** Yes, and now she's on the phone to her chin-grinder in Zurich.
    _The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** Yeah, I'll get that.  It's probably Roz.
    _He opens the door to her._
    **Frasier:** Well?
        **Roz:** Sorry I'm late, but I had a date.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I thought that was last night.
        **Roz:** It was a good date.  How's your new girlfriend?
    **Frasier:** I allowed her to climb to the first base camp on Mount Crane
             and I believe she's feeling the effects of the altitude. [_laughs_]
        **Roz:** Is one of them nausea?  Cause I'm getting that right now.
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up!
    _At the table, Martin holds up the crock, which now has labels on it._
     **Martin:** Hey, you hungry, Roz?  There's cheese here.  Oh, nobody opened 
             it.
    **Frasier:** Dear God, Dad, that's three years old!  Throw it out!
     **Martin:** No, it'll be fine.  Sure you don't want any?  The label says 
             it's "famously spreadable."
      **Niles:** Funny, Roz, doesn't your label say the same thing?
        **Roz:** What does yours say, Niles -- "may cause drowsiness"?  I'm just 
             having some fun, �cause I know I'll be settling down someday.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, thank God my dating days are over!  Three years on 
             the Seattle singles scene is quite enough, thank you.
    _The phone rings, Frasier answers._
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Oh hi, Evelyn. [_puts the phone to his shoulder_] She 
             can't go five minutes without talking to me. [_into phone_] 
             Listen, I'm really looking forward to dinner tomorrow... 
             I see.  Well, if tomorrow's no good... I see.  
    _Roz, Niles, Daphne, and Martin are all trading looks, daring each other
    to act surprised._
    **Frasier:** But you said you were having such a lovely time... I see.  
             Perhaps I'd better take this in my room.
    _He goes to his room, passing Eddie sitting in his chair._
    **Frasier:** Oh, what are you smirking at?!
    
    [_N.B. The year 1996, and the fact that Niles is still with Maris, 
    fix this episode at somewhere in the Third Season before[[3.08]](/frasier/transcripts/season_3/episode_8/the_last_time_i_saw_maris.html "The Last Time I Saw Maris"), 
    "The Last Time I Saw Maris," when Niles and Maris separated._]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Living Room
    Evening.  Frasier is reading a book on the couch.  Eddie is sitting
    up next to him, staring at him.
    
    SUPRA: "1993"_
    **Frasier:** What are you staring at?
    _Martin comes out, wearing the same sweater-vest he wore in[[1.01]](/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_1/the_good_son.html "The Good Son"), 
    "The Good Son."

     **Martin:** It's fourteen.
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** You're reading about Jack Russell terriers, right?  That's how 
             many years they live -- fourteen.
    _Frasier sheepishly closes the book.  The doorbell rings.  Frasier gets 
    up and answers it to Niles, with a shopping bag._
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Ah, there are the merry bachelors in their swinging new pad!
    _Martin just looks grumpily at him._
    **Frasier:** Where's Maris?
      **Niles:** Uh, she's taken to her bed.  This large-earring fad has 
             compressed her spine.  Where is your, uh, enchanting new 
             home healthcare worker?
    _Daphne comes out, wearing the short sundress-and-stockings ensemble
    and piled-up hairstyle she made famous in the first season._
     **Daphne:** I just found out what that second toilet in me loo is for! 
             [_laughs_] Talk about a shock!
      **Niles:** Hello there.
     **Daphne:** Hello.  You're, uh... oh, don't tell me, I'm good with names.  
             Uh... Miles Crane!
      **Niles:**...Yes, I am!  And-and you're Daphne Moon, from Manchester, 
             where you developed a liking for Nickerson's Lemon Biscuits.
    _He takes a box out of the bag._
     **Daphne:** What a kind man you are, Miles Crane.
    _She takes the biscuits and turns away.  Niles grimaces in 
    disappointment._
    **Frasier:** Oh by the way, I've invited Roz Doyle to join us -- she's my 
             producer over at the radio station.  She had no plans this 
             evening -- you know, I think the poor thing has a hard time 
             meeting men.
      **Niles:** Hm.
    **Frasier:**[_heads to the bar_] Anyway, would you care for a scotch, Niles?
      **Niles:** Uh yes -- actually, I'm in a sherry mood tonight.
    **Frasier:** Sherry?  What an intriguing idea.  Think I could scare up a 
             bottle of sherry.
    _He goes into the kitchen.  The doorbell rings again._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'll get it.
    _She answers it to Roz.  Frasier comes out of the kitchen removing the
    cork from a bottle of sherry._
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Roz, come on in.  Uh, I'd like you to meet my dad.  
             This is Martin Crane, and his home healthcare worker, Daphne 
             Moon, and of course this is my brother, Niles Crane.
    
    [_N.B. Another slight discontinuity - this is Season One, but Roz and 
    Martin actually first met in[[1.06]](/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_6/the_crucible.html "The Crucible"), "The Crucible" -- which was also
    the first time she saw Frasier's apartment._]
    
     **Daphne:** Oh my God, is it Niles?  Oh, I feel so embarrassed.
      **Niles:** Oh no, please, don't be.  Actually, I prefer Miles.
    _As he says this, he casually leans back against the cabinet - knocking 
    over the books on top and nearly falling after them himself.  Daphne 
    bends over to pick them up, and her bum stretches against her dress, 
    mesmerizing Niles.  When she straightens up, he fixes his gaze on the 
    ceiling.
    
    The doorbell rings again._
     **Martin:** Oh, that'll be my pizza.  Could you get it?
    **Frasier:** What?  You are not having pizza.  I made a duck.
     **Martin:** What, you're gonna tell me what I can eat now?
    **Frasier:** No, I'm just saying that it's rude to bring your own food to a 
             dinner party.
    _Martin goes to the kitchen as Frasier opens the door to the pizza 
    delivery boy -- Kenny, wearing a denim jacket and with long, shaggy 
    black hair.
    _
      **Kenny:** Hi.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello.
      **Kenny:** Twelve bucks.
    **Frasier:** Right.
      **Kenny:** Hey, aren't you that new radio shrink at KACL -- Dr. Frasier 
             Crane, right?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes I am.  It's always nice to meet a fan.
      **Kenny:** Well actually, I'm in the radio game myself.  This pizza 
             thing is just paying the bills until a job opens up.  Maybe 
             you could put a good word in for me down at the-
    _Frasier mumbles "thank you" and shuts the door in Kenny's face.
    He carries the pizza to the dining table as Martin comes out 
    with the crock._
        **Roz:** Pizza smells good.
     **Martin:** Well, have some.  It's called a Dirty Dozen.  Twelve delicious 
             toppings, and not one of them duck.
    **Frasier:** This from the gourmet who dumped my Cornish Yarg cheese down 
             the disposal.
     **Martin:** It was covered with mold!
    **Frasier:** It was supposed to be!
     **Martin:** Well, I said I'd replace it, didn't I?  And here it is, I hope 
             you're happy.
    _He places the crock on the table.  Frasier picks it up and reads the 
    label._
    **Frasier:** "With pasteurized, processed, cheese-flavored snack food."
             [_looks inside_] Dear God, it looks like someone melted down 
             a highway cone.
     **Martin:** Just trying to be nice, you don't need to be a jerk about it.
    **Frasier:** You're right, Dad, I'm sorry, thank you. [_to Niles_] Would you 
             please join me in the kitchen...?
    _Niles is standing at Daphne's side, smelling her hair._
    **Frasier:** Miles!
    _Reset to: Kitchen
    Niles follows Frasier in.  Frasier is carrying the crock._
    **Frasier:** He is driving me batty!  All right, we are making a deal.  
             He spends six months here, and then he's moving into your 
             house.
      **Niles:** Absolutely, we'll switch off.
    _They shake hands on it._
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] Someone bring me a beer?
        **Roz:**[_o.s._] Yeah, beer sounds good.
    **Frasier:** I should have just gotten a keg.  I tell you something, 
             this is the last time I try to make a nice dinner for 
             these people!
    _He picks up the crock and reads the label again.  The camera
    zooms in on it...
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Eight -- Present Day
    Back to where we left off.  Frasier smiles, closes the garbage, then 
    fits the broken piece back onto the crock, goes out and places it in 
    the center of the table.

    politicians all become respectable if they last long enough." -- John 
    Huston in "Chinatown."_]

    from the hallway._
    **Frasier:** Oh, hey Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Dinner's ready.
     **Martin:** All right.
    _Frasier opens the door to Daphne, Niles, and Roz._
    **Frasier:** Hello, you guys, come on in.
    _He hugs and kisses his family and friends, as they all ad-lib greetings.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    The table is set, and the Crane family are sitting down to dinner.
    To complete the place setting, Roz comes in from the kitchen with 
    some flowers in a small glass jar.  She begins to set it down in the 
    center, but Frasier takes it from her, and sentimentally decides to put 
    the crock in the place of honor.  Martin is touched, and says so; Roz
    makes a wry remark, remembering her bogus birthday gift.
    
    Frasier moves the flowers from the jar to the crock, then pours the 
    water into it.  It springs out of a dozen cracks in the sides, then 
    pours out of a hole in the bottom.  Everyone leaps away from the table, 
    then scrambles to mop up the water.
