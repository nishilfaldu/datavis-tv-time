    **Skyline:** An Elevator rises to the top of the Space Needle.
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa
    FADE IN
    
    Niles and Martin are seated at a table.  Frasier enters in his squash
    togs._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello Dad, hi Niles.
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** [_to the counter waiter_] Uh, may I get my usual, please? 
             [_notices Niles's suit_] Niles, we're playing squash in twenty 
             minutes.  Where are your togs?
      **Niles:** Oh, yes, I had to hide them in my briefcase.  I told Daphne I 
             was seeing patients all day.  It was the only way I could get 
             out of driving her to this flower show.  It's two hours there 
             and back.
    **Frasier:** I see.  Well, we could have rescheduled.  Did you really have 
             to lie?
      **Niles:** Did I mention we'd be joined by Daphne's mother, who's 
             suffering from some female complaint and can't get it through
             her head that I'm not a gynecologist?
    **Frasier:** Ah.  Well, then you had to save yourself.
    _The waiter brings their coffees._
      **Niles:** Thank you.  So, please, don't tell anyone we're playing squash 
             today.  I can't have it getting back to Daphne.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    
    _Roz enters._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, guys! [_they all ad-lib hellos_] I'm so glad you're here, 
             you can meet my new boyfriend.  He's the hottest guy I've 
             dated since...
      **Niles:** Frasier...
    _He has noticed a man in a topcoat getting his coffee at the counter.  
    Frasier turns to look and also becomes excited._
        **Roz:** Okay, the hottest guy since... [_cracking up_] Frasier. [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** That's Alistair Burke!
    **Frasier:** I know!
     **Martin:** Who's Alistair Burke?
    **Frasier:** He is only the head of the Seattle Opera Guild, and one of the 
             finest directors in the world.
      **Niles:** His productions are brilliant.  He staged a Phillip Glass 
             opera last year, and no one left.
    _Frasier and Niles rise to introduce themselves._
    [_N.B. This would be the second time that Kelsey Grammer and Patrick 
    Stewart have crossed paths -- the first being Grammer's cameo on _Star 
    Trek: The Next Generation _as Captain Morgan Bateson in the episode, 
    "Cause and Effect."
    
    Grammer was the third actor from_ Cheers _to appear on a_ Star Trek _set, 
    after Kirstie Alley in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" and Bebe Neuwirth 
    in the_ Next Generation _episode "First Contact."
    
    On the other hand, Stewart is the fourth actor from a_ Star Trek _series 
    to appear on Frasier - the others being Robert Picardo from_ Voyager _in[[9.11]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_11/bully_for_martin.html "Bully for Martin") "Bully for Martin," Brent Spiner from _Next Generation _in[[10.13]](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_13/lilith_needs_a_favor.html "Lilith Needs A Favor")"Lilith Needs a Favor," and Nana Visitor from _Deep Space Nine _in[[10.14]](/frasier/transcripts/season_10/episode_14/daphne_does_dinner.html "Daphne Does Dinner")"Daphne Does Dinner."_]
    
     **Frasier:** Alistair -- uh, it's, it's Frasier Crane.  Uh, we met last 
              year at the fundraiser.
    **Alistair:** [_shaking hands_] Of course!  You're on the radio.
     **Frasier:** Yes, yes!
    **Alistair:** [_to Niles_] And you're, uh -- don't tell me...
    _Niles waits with a hopeful grin._
    **Alistair:** All right, tell me.
       **Niles:** [_deflated_] Niles Crane. [_also shakes hands_]
     **Frasier:** Yes, we've both got tickets to your premiere, and, oh, we 
              can't wait to see what magic you'll work with "La Boheme."
    **Alistair:** [_arch_] Well, I would be content if my Mimi would just lay off 
              the cheeseburgers.  I sat her down yesterday and I said, 
              "you're dying of consumption, dear, not over-consumption."
    _Frasier and Niles both give loud, suck-up laughs.  Martin and Roz share 
    an eye-roll._
     **Frasier:** Oh, that's hilarious!
       **Niles:** It's funny because it's bitchy.
     **Frasier:** Yes, and how well you're looking!
    **Alistair:** Oh, thank you.
       **Niles:** I like your suit!
    **Alistair:** Well, you're too kind, and it's nice to see you again.  Bye-
              bye, take care.
    _Alistair leaves.  Frasier and Niles are still grinning with excitement._
        **Roz:** Wow, that was thorough.  Find any polyps up there?
    **Frasier:** We were merely paying due respect to one of the giants of the 
             opera world.
    _Barry, Roz's new boyfriend, enters.  He is wearing jeans and a black
    t-shirt that shows off his physique to good effect._
      **Barry:** Hey!
        **Roz:** Barry, hi!  This is Frasier, and Niles, and Martin.
    _Barry shakes their hands._
     **Martin:** Hi -- whoa, strong handshake.  You look like you work out a 
             lot.
        **Roz:** He practically lives at the gym.
      **Barry:** Well, it's my church.
    _Frasier looks suspicious._
      **Barry:** Oh, this blouse looks amazing on you.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's very chic, Roz.
        **Roz:** Well, Barry picked it out.  He's the women's wear buyer at 
             Bidwell's.  He spent a whole day last week going through my 
             closet and throwing out all the stuff I shouldn't wear 
             anymore.
      **Barry:** You should have seen what she was still holding on to -- 
             culottes!
        **Roz:** Stop it!
    _She pushes him playfully towards the counter._
    **Frasier:** Well... one wonders what's been in Barry's closet a little too 
             long. [_Niles sniggers_]
     **Martin:** What are you talking about?
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, he didn't seem gay to you?
     **Martin:** That guy's not gay!  You know how you can tell?  The muscles.
      **Niles:** [_playing along_] Good point, Dad.  Second tip-off: no poodle.
    _Martin nods.  Roz comes back._
        **Roz:** So, isn't he fabulous?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, uh, fabulous sums it up in a word.
     **Martin:** I think he's perfect for you, Roz -- good-looking, friendly, 
             [_at Frasier_] and not gay at all.
        **Roz:** Who said he was gay?
     **Martin:** Not me.
        **Roz:** He's not gay!
    **Frasier:** Yes, all right, Roz, but you can see how someone might get 
             that impression, all right?
        **Roz:** Why, because of his job?  Because he takes care of himself?  
             That is just such lazy, stereotypical...
    **Frasier:** All right, you're right, it was a shallow, knee-jerk assumption, 
             and unworthy of us, both as psychiatrists and men about town.
    _Barry comes back with two takeout cups in a tray, and a biscotti._
      **Barry:** We better go, we're gonna miss the movie.
        **Roz:** Right, bye.
     **Martin:** See you.
        **Roz:** [_sees the tray_] What, no biscotti for you?
      **Barry:** Please -- I'm a house.
    _They exit.  Frasier and Niles mouth at each other, "So gay."
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Street
    It's evening, and Frasier and Niles are walking home together.  Niles 
    is back in his suit, but Frasier is still in his squash togs, and his 
    stride is extremely short.
    _
      **Niles:** Can't you walk any faster?
    **Frasier:** I'm moving as fast as I can in these ridiculous shorts of 
             yours.
      **Niles:** Well, you wouldn't need them if you hadn't burst out of your 
             own.
    **Frasier:** I did not burst out of them.  My laundress simply over-
             bleached them until they had the tensile strength of a cobweb.  
             If you're in such a hurry you should have brought your own 
             car.
      **Niles:** Daphne needed it for her flower show.  And remember...
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, you were seeing patients.  We did not play squash.
    _Niles stops._
      **Niles:** Is that Roz's boyfriend?
    _It is indeed Barry at the other end of the street, walking towards 
    them.  Frasier and Niles turn toward each other in a huddle._
      **Niles:** Oh, you don't suppose she told him what we were saying about 
             him?
    **Frasier:** No, I can't imagine she would do that.  Let's just act 
             natural.
      **Niles:** All right.
    _But when they turn back, Barry has gone._
    **Frasier:** Where did he go?
      **Niles:** Odd.  He was just here.
    _Walking forward, they notice a set of stairs leading down, below a lit
    sign that says, "Bad Billy's."_
      **Niles:** "Bad Billy's."  What sort of place do you think that is?
    _Frasier reads another sign by the stairs: "Tuesday is Leather Night."_
    **Frasier:** Well, let's see.  Tuesday is leather night... so it's probably 
             some sort of shoe outlet. [_then_] It's a gay bar, you idiot. 
             [_Niles mouths, "I know that"_] Come on, let's go.
    _He heads for the stairs._
      **Niles:** What?!  No, no, no, no!  I told Daphne I was seeing patients 
             until seven.  If I'm late, she might get suspicious.
    **Frasier:** Niles, Roz is my friend.  I'm not going to let her get hurt by 
             some man who's lying to her about himself.  I'll be just a 
             minute.
    _He heads down the stairs as Niles waits outside, uncomfortable.
    
    CUT TO: Inside Bad Billy's
    Frasier enters.  Men of varying ages and attires are sat at tables
    or standing around -- but Frasier immediately stands out in his skimpy
    shorts.  He approaches a man at a table.
    _
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, uh, I'm looking for a guy.
     **Patron:** Yeah, I kinda got that from the shorts.
    **Frasier:** It's a particular guy -- he's about thirty-five years old...
    _The bartender hails Frasier._
    **Eduardo:** Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Eduardo! [_to the patron_] My furniture polisher.  Don't tell me 
             you put away paste and chamois for life as a barkeep.
    **Eduardo:** I just do this on the side.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, bet you're surprised to see me in here.
    **Eduardo:** [_going along_] Okay.
    **Frasier:** All right, look, I thought I saw a friend of mine come in 
             here.  He's, uh, mid-thirties, uh, wavy hair, good build...
    **Eduardo:** Yeah, I think he's in the bathroom.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh...
    _He is unsure what to do next, when loud dance music blares.  Almost
    unconsciously, he starts moving to the beat.  He decides to wait._
    **Eduardo:** Can I get you a drink?
    **Frasier:** [_still moving to the music; "why not?"_] Sherry, please.
    _CUT TO: Street
    Niles is still waiting outside, when Barry emerges from the 
    apartment building that they passed walking towards Bad Billy's 
    after Barry vanished -- apparently that's where he was really going.
    
    Mortified, Niles grabs a free magazine from a rack next to the 
    stairway, opens it and holds it in front of his face.  As Barry
    walks past him, this is no impediment to identification.
    _
      **Barry:** Oh, hi Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Barry.
    _When Barry has passed, Niles really looks at the magazine's contents.
    Confused, he looks at the front cover and starts, realizing it is a 
    gay adult contact magazine.  He hurriedly replaces it, grabs his 
    briefcase and runs down the stairs.
    
    CUT TO: Bad Billy's
    Frasier is sitting at the bar, sipping his sherry and bobbing to the
    music.  Niles comes in, very uncomfortable._
      **Niles:** [_over the music_] Frasier, Barry's not here.  I just saw him.
    **Frasier:** [_not hearing him_] What?
      **Niles:** Barry's not here, let's go.
    **Frasier:** He's in the bathroom.
      **Niles:** No, he's not.  Can we just go, please?
    **Frasier:** What did you say?
      **Niles:** Daphne's expecting me, let's go!
    **Frasier:** Come again?
      **Niles:** [_yelling_] Oh, for God's sake...
    _The music stops abruptly._
      **Niles:** I'm begging you, please take me home!
    _The brothers look around, acutely aware that everyone is looking at 
    them with big grins._
    **Frasier:** You see, actually, he and I are...
    _Another loud dance number starts up, drowning him out.  He gives up
    and heads for the door.  As he leaves, Eduardo grins and flashes him
    a thumbs-up.  Frasier smiles feebly and exits with Niles.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE DOCTOR IS OUT**
    _Scene Three -- KACL
    Frasier is doing his show.
    _
    **Frasier:** You can rationalize your actions all you want to, Kevin, but 
             the truth is, you're just not being honest, are you?
      **Kevin:** [_v.o._] I guess I'm not, but it's not like you're so honest 
             about everything in your life.
    **Frasier:** I beg your pardon?
      **Kevin:** Well, you've never told your audience you're gay.
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?
      **Kevin:** I saw you in a gay bar last night.
    _Roz, at first surprised, now looks mad -- she already suspects what 
    this is about.  Frasier gives her an uncomfortable glance.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh, I see. [_chuckling_] Yes, in fact, I did pop into Bad 
             Billy's yesterday.  You see, I thought I had seen a gentlemen 
             I wished to speak with go in there, and I'd certainly never 
             been in that bar before.
      **Kevin:** Then how come you knew the bartender by name?  And why were 
             you wearing those tight little shorts?
    **Frasier:** Well, they-they were not my shorts.  You see, I'd been playing 
             squash, and I borrowed them from my... [_catches himself_] uh, 
             from my friend, who is slim-hipped.
      **Kevin:** Yeah, kind of like that nervous guy you picked up.
    **Frasier:** Look, I did not pick anybody up!  All right, I am going to put 
             an end to this discussion, because there is nothing to 
             discuss.  On my way home from the gym, I popped into Bad 
             Billy's looking for a man I was hoping was in the bathroom.  I 
             had a quick sherry with my French polisher and then I left.  
             As for how I got into another man's shorts, that is no one's 
             business!
    _Realizing what he has said and how it sounds, he is about to dig 
    himself in deeper, but Roz cuts him off._
        **Roz:** And we're off the air.
    **Frasier:** [_throws off his headphones_] Oh, dear God!
    _Roz enters his booth, furious._
        **Roz:** That man you thought you saw going into Bad Billy's, that 
             wouldn't be Barry, would it?
    **Frasier:** All right, Roz.  I-I saw him on the street, I turned, and the 
             next thing I knew he was gone.  I thought he was...
        **Roz:** Yeah, you know what Barry was doing from 10:00 until midnight 
             last night?
    **Frasier:** What?
        **Roz:** Me, that's what!  He's not gay, whereas you, Miss Marple, 
             you've just been outed.
    **Frasier:** Outed?!
    _The door opens, and -- who else? -- Gil enters.
    _
        **Gil:** Frasier!  I am so sorry, I thought that last call was 
             appalling.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Gil.
        **Gil:** You poor man!  How long you must have dreaded this dark, yet 
             inevitable day.  I so wish you could have been allowed to come  
             out in a time and manner of your own choosing, instead of 
             being wrenched from your closet, your voice cracking, your 
             cheeks crimson with shame...
    **Frasier:** Gil, I am not gay. [_packs his briefcase_]
        **Gil:** Oh, Frasier, you can't play coy once you've been caught 
             traipsing about Bad Billy's in shorts that left little to the 
             imagination.
    **Frasier:** They were not my shorts!  I simply borrowed them because my 
             own had split when I bent over...
        **Gil:** Oh, please!  We don't need to know _everything_.  I just want to 
             say that your KACL family will be here for you as you take 
             your first brave steps on that yellow brick road to pride and 
             self-acceptance and...
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up, you big queen!
    _He exits with his briefcase._
        **Gil:** I see Kitty has claws.
    _As mad as she is, Roz is trying hard not to laugh.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier is sat at a table, having just finished his coffee.  A waitress
    brings him two biscotti on a plate and collects his empty cup.
    _
     **Frasier:** Oh, um, another latte to go, please. [_hands her some money_] 
              And you can take it out of there, thank you. [_re: biscotti_] 
              I-I didn't order these.
    **Waitress:** They're from those guys over there.
    _She motions to two men seated at the counter.  They smile and wave at
    Frasier, which he feebly returns.  Martin enters, in a bleak mood._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad.  You care for a coffee?
     **Martin:** Nah.  I can see where you might think I would, though.  A guy  
             walks into a coffee bar, he can't blame people for thinking he 
             likes coffee.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad.
     **Martin:** Course, uh, if he didn't like it, he could make that clear to 
             people.  He might say, "I am not a coffee drinker"...
    _Frasier, chewing disconsolately on one of the biscotti, nods._
     **Martin:** Or, "I have never tried coffee even once."
    **Frasier:** Yes, all right, Dad.
     **Martin:** "I am not even curious about..."
    **Frasier:** Yes, all right! [_the waitress brings his latte_] Thank you.
    _Martin trudges to the counter.  Niles comes in, with the now-familiar
    smug little grin on his face.  He sits with Frasier._
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** I see you caught my show.
      **Niles:** Mmm-hmm.
    **Frasier:** Go ahead, let's hear it.
      **Niles:** I'm not going to tease you.  I'm grateful.  You could have 
             ratted me out to Daphne, but instead, you protected me... just 
             like a big sister should. [_sniggers_]
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm glad this tickles you.
      **Niles:** I shouldn't make fun.  You people have been persecuted long 
             enough as it is. [_sniggers again_]
    **Frasier:** Are you done?
      **Niles:** I'm done.
    **Frasier:** [_rises_] I will return those shorts to you tomorrow.
      **Niles:** No, keep them, you'll want them for the parade! [_laughs, then_] 
             I'm done, now I'm done.
    _As Frasier is about to leave, and Martin comes back to the table with 
    his coffee, Alistair emerges from the men's room._
    **Alistair:** Frasier!
     **Frasier:** Oh, Alistair.
    **Alistair:** So sorry to hear about your ordeal today.
     **Frasier:** Oh, boy -- you heard my show then?
    **Alistair:** No, I heard the replay on "Kiki and Mel's Drivetime Circus."  
              If it's any comfort, I went through the same thing myself 
              once.
     **Frasier:** Really?
    **Alistair:** Yes, I was a guest on a call-in show, and an angry ex-
              boyfriend phoned in.  Everything came out: names, dates, 
              birthmarks.  Had quite a chat with the wife that night.  
              Very frank... very expensive.
    
    [_N.B. Ian McKellen's "outing" occurred in similar circumstances -- the 
    actor was a guest on a call-in show, and when the discussion drifted 
    to the subject of gay rights, one particularly conservative caller
    remarked, "why can't those people just stay in their clubs?"
    
    McKellen lost his temper and shot back, "you mean like the Garrick Club?"  
    (a very old, very conservative restaurant/men's club in London)  
    
    McKellen then revealed his orientation, adding that he wouldn't be caught 
    dead in the Garrick._]
    
     **Frasier:** Oh, how awful for you.  Of course, in my case-
    **Alistair:** I know what might rally your spirits.  I'm giving a small party 
              after the premiere of my opera next week.  Are you free to come?
    _Behind Alistair, Niles shoots to his feet._
     **Frasier:** I'd be delighted!
    **Alistair:** Splendid!  Well, I must get to rehearsals.
     **Frasier:** Oh, how are things coming?
    **Alistair:** You can tag along, see for yourself if you like. [_Niles gapes_]
     **Frasier:** I would love that!  Let me just grab my coffee. [_runs back to 
              his table and does_] Goodbye, Dad. [_smugly_] Niles.
    _He exits.  Niles turns around, apoplectic -- mouth gaping, knees wobbling.  
    He sinks into his chair.
    _
       **Niles:** Did you see that?  I would kill to go to that party! [_sulky_] 
              I was at that gay bar too, you know.
      **Martin:** Let's see... one of my sons just got picked up by a guy.  My 
              other son is jealous. [_bites his biscotti_] Yep, life is good.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Apartment
    Martin is sitting in his chair, and Daphne is rolling up her exercise
    mat -- they have just finished Martin's exercises.  Niles is also there.  
    Frasier enters, excited.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dad, please clean up that debris around your chair.  Alistair 
             is coming by.
     **Martin:** Oh, Alistair -- that's all we've heard around here all week.  
             Alistair this, Alistair that...
     **Daphne:** You can't blame him for being excited.  It's fun having a 
             famous friend.  When I lived in England... do you know the 
             actor Peter O'Toole?
     **Martin:** [_interested_] Sure.
     **Daphne:** I always thought it would be fun to be friends with him.
    _Martin sinks back down again -- what did he expect?  The doorbell rings.
    _
    **Frasier:** Now, that's him.  Everyone just act natural.
    _He opens the door._
    **Alistair:** Frasier!
     **Frasier:** Alistair!
    _They hug and kiss each other's cheeks._
    **Alistair:** You smell fantastic.
     **Frasier:** Oh, it must be my new conditioner.  Sandalwood with just a 
              hint of...?
    **Alistair:** ...Cloves.
     **Frasier:** Oh, the man's amazing.  He has the musical panache of Leonard 
              Bernstein and the nose of a Tuscan truffle hog.
    **Alistair:** You turn my head, sir.
     **Frasier:** Oh, well, come and meet my father, Martin Crane.
    **Alistair:** Well, how lovely to meet you, Martin.
      **Martin:** [_shaking hands_] How are you?
    **Alistair:** Niles...
       **Niles:** Hello.
    **Alistair:** Love the tie.
       **Niles:** [_preening_] Charvet.
      **Daphne:** And I'm Daphne, Niles' wife.
    **Alistair:** [_disbelieving_] No.
       **Niles:** We're expecting.
    **Alistair:** Can't say I was.  How lovely to meet you, Daphne.
      **Daphne:** Likewise.
    
    [_N.B.  Again, Jane Leeves is very obviously pregnant by this time --
    though unlike Season Eight, they're taking no trouble to conceal it._]
    
    **Alistair:** Frasier, this apartment is stunning.
     **Frasier:** Thank you.
    **Alistair:** The view -- breathtaking; the art -- perfect; the chair -- 
              hilarious.
    _Martin looks put down.  Alistair's mobile rings._
    **Alistair:** Damn.  So sorry.  I have to take this call. [_answers phone_] 
              Hello?  Placido!
    _Frasier nearly falls over._
     **Frasier:** Placido Domingo?!
    **Alistair:** [_aside_] Yes. [_Niles also gapes; into phone_] I'm here with 
              Frasier.  Yes, he's the one I told you about.  Oh, stop!
    _He motions around, asking Frasier where he can talk in private._
     **Frasier:** Oh, oh, yes, uh... in the kitchen.
    **Alistair:** [_heads into the kitchen; into phone_] Well, you'll meet him 
              next month at the concert in Madrid. [_puts phone to shoulder_]
              Oops!  Now I've spoiled the surprise.
    _He goes into the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** [_ecstatic_] He's taking me to Madrid!
     **Martin:** You just met him last week, what's going on?  He kissed you.
    **Frasier:** Well, he's a man of the theater, he kisses everyone.  Well, 
             it's not like he's the first gay friend I've ever had.
      **Niles:** He's the first one who thinks you're gay, too.
    **Frasier:** He does not think I'm gay.
      **Niles:** He thinks I'm gay, and I'm standing next to my pregnant wife.
     **Martin:** Have you told him you're straight?
    **Frasier:** I don't have to.  I mean, it's obvious -- we are just friends. 
             [_crosses his arms_] He is not courting me.
      **Niles:** [_notices_] Is that a new watch?
    **Frasier:** [_drops his arms_] So what if it is!
     **Daphne:** Jewelry!  Ooh, he's a keeper.
    **Frasier:** Stop that!  My friendship with Alistair is the best thing 
             that's happened to me in months.  I will not have you sully it 
             by making it out to be something it's not.
    _Alistair sweeps in again._
    **Alistair:** Sorry, my angel.  Well, we'd best get to that tailor.
     **Frasier:** Oh, yes, yes, we're having new tuxes made for Alistair's 
              premiere party this weekend.
    **Alistair:** To which you are all invited.
       **Niles:** [_gasps_] Thank you!
    _As they leave, Alistair picks up a treat from a plate of small pastries
    that Frasier set out._
      **Daphne:** Will Peter O'Toole be there?
    **Alistair:** No, and he knows why. [_eats one_] These are amazing!  Where 
              did you get them?
     **Frasier:** I made them myself.
    **Alistair:** No... is there anything this man can't do?
       **Niles:** Time will tell.
    _Frasier and Alistair exit.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE QUEERNESS OF YOU**
    _Scene Six -- Alistair's Mansion
    It's late in the evening after Alistair's premiere, but the elegant
    party is in full swing in the grand ballroom of Alistair's home.
    A string quartet is playing.
    
    Frasier and Niles, in tuxes, enter with Daphne, in an ample dress.
    Both brothers are dazzled by the attendance.
    _
       **Niles:** Will you look at this crowd?  It's like a Who's Who of the 
              cr�me de la cr�me of the upper crust!
    _Alistair, also in a tux, appears at the top of the grand staircase._
    **Alistair:** Frasier!
     **Frasier:** [_coming over_] Alistair, your production was a triumph!
    **Alistair:** Wasn't it? [_then_] Smile.
    _He poses with Frasier for a photographer, huddling close to Frasier.
    This gives Frasier another frisson of uncertainty, but he forces it
    down._
    **Alistair:** [_to Niles and Daphne_] Welcome, welcome.
       **Niles:** Thank you.
    **Alistair:** There are so many people here I'm dying for you to meet, but 
              I have to make a little announcement first.  Glinka, darling,  
              come and meet Frasier.
    _Frasier is overwhelmed again -- Glinka, a diva and the star of the show!
    _
      **Glinka:** Frasier, finally!
     **Frasier:** Oh, Glinka, it's such an honor to meet you.  I have all your 
              recordings. [_kisses her hands_]
      **Glinka:** So I hear that you and Alistair are quite an item.
     **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, no, we're just very good friends.
      **Glinka:** [_playing along_] Oh, yes.  Yes, of course.
    _Alistair mounts the staircase._
    **Alistair:** Everyone!  Could I have your attention, please?  I have to 
              announce that our very own Nigel Frye is retiring and giving 
              up his seat on the Opera board...
    _As Nigel raises his glass, the crowd sigh sadly._
    **Alistair:** But I am thrilled to name as his successor a tireless 
              supporter of opera in Seattle, Dr. Frasier Crane.
    _For Frasier, that's the final triumph.  He gapes, trembling with 
    ecstasy, as everyone oohs and aahs, applauding._
     **Frasier:** Oh!  Oh, my!  Oh, I never dreamed... [_hugs Alistair_] 
              Oh, thank you, thank you!
    **Alistair:** [_between kisses on Frasier's cheeks_] Congratu...lations.
      **Glinka:** [_aside to Niles and Daphne_] Stunning couple, aren't they?
       **Niles:** I'm more stunned by them each day.
    _Frasier comes over to them, still ecstatic._
    **Frasier:** [_hugs Daphne_] Oh, Daph. 
     **Daphne:** What an honor.
    **Frasier:** Oh my God!
      **Niles:** Isn't it thrilling?  Frasier, can we talk to you for a moment?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** Do you realize that every person in this room thinks that 
             you're Alistair's boyfriend?
    **Frasier:** Listen, I can't help it if people think we're a couple.  The 
             point is, I'm enjoying myself, and if you're too jealous to be 
             happy for me, then that's your problem.
      **Niles:** Jealous?!
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's right.  All my life, I have dreamed of being half 
             of a power couple, and I finally am!  Is it perfect?  No.  But 
             it's fun, and I don't want it to end.
     **Daphne:** Don't you worry at all that Alistair might be falling for you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, please, the man has not even made a move on me.  And do 
             you know why?  Because we are friends.  Famous, fabulous 
             friends.
    _Alistair comes over._
       **Niles:** Oh, uh, Alistair.  Congratulations, it was a stunning 
              production.
    **Alistair:** Well, thank you, Niles.
      **Daphne:** It must be awfully hard work putting on an opera.
    **Alistair:** It is utterly draining.  In fact, when I'm in rehearsals, I 
              devote every ounce of strength to it.  No exercising, no 
              jogging, I even abstain from sex.  Well, you can ask Frasier 
              here. [_caresses Frasier's chin_] My poor, dear, patient 
              Frasier.
      **Glinka:** [_comes over_] Care to dance?
    **Alistair:** I would love to. [_caresses Frasier's chin again_] Don't go 
              far.
    _He and Glinka move off._
       **Niles:** [_smug again_] Well, looks like Nigel won't be the only one 
              "giving up his seat" tonight.
     **Frasier:** I could scratch your eyes out and not one person here would  
              find it strange.
      **Daphne:** I'm sorry.
     **Frasier:** Damn my fatal allure.
    _He goes over to where Alistair and Glinka are dancing._
     **Frasier:** Alistair, when you're finished with this dance...
      **Glinka:** [_charmed_] Oh no, be my guest.
    _She breaks away and allows Frasier to cut in.  Alistair and Frasier
    begin to waltz, Frasier very uncomfortable._
    **Alistair:** Frasier, do you have any idea how sexy you look in that tux?
     **Frasier:** Yes, I do.  Alistair, I'm afraid I may have given you the 
              wrong impression about myself.
    **Alistair:** You seem nervous.  Don't be.  And I want to thank you for 
              waiting.
     **Frasier:** Oh no, the waiting was good, I enjoyed the waiting.
    **Alistair:** Oh, me too! [_twirls Frasier_] How it sharpens the appetite.  
              How it builds! [_dancing more against him_] The intensity, the 
              heat, the desire!  Can you feel it?!
     **Frasier:** [_literally, in terror_] Oh yes, there it is! 
    _He stops dancing and takes Alistair aside._
     **Frasier:** Alistair, um... listen, I-I, I'm afraid I have to tell you 
              something.  Uh... I'm not gay.
    **Alistair:** Oh, Frasier, please don't tell me you're still struggling 
              with those issues.
     **Frasier:** Well, I-I like you so much, and I love our friendship.  I'm 
              afraid we can never really be more than friends.
    **Alistair:** Would three weeks on Capri in Bertolucci's villa change your 
              mind?
    _Frasier struggles mightily._
     **Frasier:** It's worth a try. [_then_] No, no, no.  It-it wouldn't. I'm 
              sorry.
    **Alistair:** [_sighs_] Well, then...
     **Frasier:** I'm so sorry.
    **Alistair:** So am I.  Could I ask a small favor of you?
     **Frasier:** Of course, anything.
    **Alistair:** Would you mind staying tonight until my other guests have 
              gone?  I'd hate my friends to think I've been jilted.
     **Frasier:** Of course.
    **Alistair:** It won't be very late.  Around about 3:00 it's down to the 
              core crowd, and we'll all relax and unwind.
    _Alistair's servant comes over._
     Servant: It's after midnight, sir.  Shall I fire up the hot tub?
    **Alistair:** Absolutely.
     **Frasier:** I'm afraid I don't have a bathing suit.
    **Alistair:** Then you'll fit right in.
    _He drifts away into the crowd as Frasier starts to look panicked.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    
    **Credits:**
    Street:
    Roz and Barry are walking home along the same street after an evening out.  
    As they pass Bad Billy's, they walk by another man rather obviously hiding 
    his face with a magazine.  Reaching the door of Barry's building, they kiss 
    and then go inside.
    
    The man lowers the magazine -- it is Gil.  He folds the magazine under his arm, 
    gives his hair a smooth-down pat, and walks down the stairs to Bad Billy's.
