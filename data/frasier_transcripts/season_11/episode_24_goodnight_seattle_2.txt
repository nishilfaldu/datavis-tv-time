    _ACT THREE
    
    Scene Seven -- The Branford Inn
    Daphne re-enters.
    _
     **Daphne:** There's a veterinarian's five minutes from here, I'm sure he 
             can make Eddie cough up that ring.
    **Frasier:** All right then, off you go, both of you.
    _Daphne and Niles exit with Eddie._
    **Frasier:** Hurry, please!  We've only got the skywriter until five!
    _As he settles down, he notices the heat growing in the room._
    **Frasier:** Clint, would you please turn up that air conditioning to 
             the maximum?  That ice sculpture over there is by the 
             renowned artist Arthur Nudzac, and it's melting already!
    _Clint does.  In a few seconds, however, the unit sputters and dies with 
    a rattle._
    **Frasier:** What's that?
      **Clint:** We just blew out the compressor.
    **Frasier:** Just don't just stand there, please, call a repairman.
    _Clint exits.  Roz knocks on the glass, with a crowd of highly agitated 
    guests behind her.  They are coughing._
        **Roz:** Frasier!  Frasier!
    _Frasier cracks the door._
        **Roz:** You have got to let these people in!
    **Frasier:** Yes, Roz, I'm sorry, I know it's warm...
        **Roz:** No, it's not the heat.  That truck that just crashed was full 
             of cattle.
    _Distressed mooing is heard in the distance._
    **Frasier:** Well, the sound of gentle mooing in the background might lend 
             a pastoral effect.
        **Roz:** Cattle, Frasier -- large, un-diapered cattle that just heard a 
             cannon go off!
    **Frasier:** Oh.  All right, I'll handle this.  Um, wedding guests, we thank 
             you for your cooperation and your patience...
    _Seeing the door open, the guests ignore him and push their way in, 
    holding their noses._
    **Frasier:** People, people, please!
    _But he's helpless to stem the tide.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Eight -- Vet's Office
    Daphne and Niles are seated in the waiting room with Eddie.  Also
    seated are a man with a carrying cage, and a woman, Rachel, playing 
    with a monkey perched on her shoulder.
    
    The vet, a young man named Dr. Hauck, comes out with a pill bottle.
    _
      **Hauck:**[_to the owner_] Okay, here are your pills, twice a day. [_leans 
             down to the box's door_] And you feel better, Mr. Kitty Cat.
    _A harsh meow from the cage jerks him back.  He straightens up._
      **Hauck:** Who's next?
     **Rachel:** I am. [_the monkey cheeps_]
      **Hauck:** Oh, gosh.
    
    [_N.B. Arleen Sorkin has a long affiliation with_ Frasier _.  Aside from 
    being the wife of executive producer Christopher Lloyd, she often
    voiced the parts of callers into Frasier's show during rehearsals 
    and studio tapings, before the celebrity voices were dubbed in later.  
    Of course, I remember her best as the voice of Harley Quinn on_ Batman: 
    the Animated Series _ -- her shining moment was successfully performing 
    "Amazing Grace" on a kazoo. -- Mike Lee_]
    
      **Niles:** Actually, we have an emergency here.  Our dog swallowed a 
             ring, and it's holding up a whole wedding.
     **Rachel:** Go ahead, I can wait.
    **Daphne/**Niles:**** Thank you./Thank you so much.
    _Reset to: Examining Room
    Daphne and Niles follow Dr. Hauck in and place Eddie on the surgical 
    table._
      **Hauck:** Boy, no easy ones today.  Talk about hitting the ground 
             running.
      **Niles:** Is this your first day?
      **Hauck:** Yep.  I'm not in Kansas anymore.
      **Niles:** Where'd you go to vet school?
      **Hauck:** Kansas.  All right, here we go.  Now if you hold his mouth 
             open for me, I'll see if I can get his paw down his throat... 
             [_off their shocked looks_] I'm just kidding, I'm just... you 
             know what, why don't I just take your pooch to the other room 
             here, and I'll just, I'll be right back.
      **Niles:** All right.
      **Hauck:** Excuse me. [_picks up Eddie_] All right, buddy.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    _He carries Eddie to another room._
     **Daphne:** He has no idea what he's doing.
      **Niles:** Oh, he's just new at this, he's nervous.
     **Daphne:** I've been a bit nervous myself lately, ever since me brothers 
             showed up.
      **Niles:** Really?  Why?
     **Daphne:** Well, you know, the way they keep patting my stomach and 
             saying, "he's a Moon all right!"
      **Niles:**[_relieved_] Oh my God, yes!
     **Daphne:** And every time they say that, all I can think is, what if he's 
             not?  What if he's like you and Frasier?
    _Niles looks up, appalled._
      **Niles:** Excuse me?
     **Daphne:** Oh, a Moon boy I know how to handle.  But what if he's a 
             little genius -- teasing me in French by the time he's six?
      **Niles:**[_laughing_] That is so funny -- I've been worried he's gonna 
             turn out like one of your brothers.  I was sure when he kicked 
             that speaker off your belly, that you had a little Simon in 
             there.
     **Daphne:**[_chuckles_] They are a handful, my brothers.  I can just 
             imagine the hell they're raising back there.
      **Niles:** With an open bar?
    _They chuckle -- then Daphne suddenly clutches her stomach and we hear 
    the sound of water trickling onto the floor.
    _
     **Daphne:**[_gasps_] Oh my God, my water just broke!  The baby's coming!
      **Niles:** Because I said "open bar"?!
    _Daphne begins to scream as her contractions start._
      **Niles:** Oh, okay, all right, don't-don't panic, there's plenty of time 
             to get you to a hospital.
     **Daphne:** Oh! -- the hell there is, it's coming right now!  Oh...!
    _Dr. Hauck enters._
      **Hauck:** Here's your ring.
      **Niles:** Oh, here, here -- [_grabs the ring_] Call an ambulance, my wife's 
             having a baby!
     **Daphne:** There's no time for an ambulance!  Oh!
      **Niles:** Oh my God!
      **Hauck:** Oh my God!  Uh, uh, you know what, why don't you-you call 
             9-1-1...
      **Niles:** All right!
      **Hauck:**...and-and I'll just, I'll just get started here.
    _Niles grabs a phone off the wall._
      **Hauck:** Oh, wait!  Wait, wait, wait! [_they stop and look at him_] 
             I'm going to wash my hands!
    _As he rushes to the sink, panic makes Daphne scream even louder._
     **Daphne:** Are you sure you know what you're doing?!
      **Hauck:** Oh, I've assisted in many deliveries, ma'am.  In fact, one 
             just took blue ribbon at the Kansas State Fair.
     **Daphne:** Oh!  Oh my God!  Oh!
    _Dr. Hauck helps her to lie on the surgical table._
      **Hauck:** Easy now, you're doing great, girl.
     **Daphne:** Don't call me that, I'm not a bloody poodle!
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] Yes, hello, hello!  We're at, we're at, uh... 
             [_checks the phone_] 1206 East Vilage Road, my wife's gone 
             into labor! [_to her_] They say the hospital is twenty miles 
             away, can you make it if I drive you-?
    _Daphne's only response is a louder scream._
      **Niles:** She says no.
    _He hangs up and faces Daphne._
      **Niles:** All right, they're on their way, they're on their way, now you 
             just calm down.  Focus on me, and breathe.  Breathe...
    _He begins Lamaze breathing, inhaling rapidly and blowing his cheeks 
    out.  Daphne looks at him and does the same.  However, Niles's panic 
    gets the better of him and his inhalations quickly turn to wheezing as 
    he starts to hyperventilate, then passes out onto the floor._
     **Daphne:** Oh!  Oh, for God's sakes!  Oh!
    _Dr. Hauck is still struggling into rubber gloves and a surgical mask 
    when Rachel opens the door._
     **Rachel:** Is everything okay in here?
      **Hauck:** We're fine.
     **Rachel:** Okay.  If you need any help, I'm a registered nurse. [_starts 
             to leave_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, get the hell back in here!
      **Hauck:** Easy, girl.
     **Daphne:** Stop that!
    _As she keeps gasping, we FADE TO:
    
    Scene Nine -- The Branford Inn
    Back at the Inn, Frasier is presiding over chaos.  All the guests are 
    crowded into the dining room, sweating like pigs and fanning themselves 
    frantically.  In desperation, Roz opens the door and starts fanning the 
    air with it.
    _
    **Frasier:** Roz, do not open a window until they tow that cattle truck!
        **Roz:** God, it's a million degrees in here!  We gotta get a breeze... 
             [_coughs_] Oh my God!
    _Roz, Frasier, and all the guests stagger and cough as the fetid breeze 
    from outside fills the room.
    
    Martin and Ronee, dressed in suit and white gown, enter the room, and 
    the stench hits them in the face._
     **Martin:** Oh my God! [_he and Ronee hold their noses_]
    **Frasier:**[_putting a blithe face on it_] Dad, Ronee!  We're almost ready 
             to start!
     **Martin:** What's that smell?
    **Frasier:**[_pretending_] Smell?
    _One of the guests, an elderly lady, hastily exits with her husband._
      **Guest:**[_holding her nose_] Congratulations you two, everything's just 
             perfect, sorry I can't stay!
      **Ronee:** What's happening?
    **Frasier:** There's been a bit of a mishap with a cattle truck, and-and 
             the A.C.'s out.  But no matter!  Right, people?  It'll take 
             more than that to mar our joy at seeing these two become Mr. 
             and Mrs. Martin Crane!
    _BOOM!  Everyone jumps -- except Simon and Stephen, who just bellow with 
    laughter again and clink their champagne glasses together.
    
    In the midst of this chaos, Frasier's mobile rings.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Well, finally, Niles!  Stop babbling!  Listen, Niles, 
             you'll have to speak up, I can't hear you with that baby 
             screaming in the backgr... Oh my God!
    _He gets a joyous look on his face.
    
    [_N.B. This scene was not shown in the U.K. broadcast._]
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT THREE
    
    ACT FOUR
    
    Scene Ten -- Vet's Office
    Daphne is lying on the table, holding her newborn son.  Niles, looking
    haggard but happy, hugs her.  Rachel and Dr. Hauck are scrubbing down
    in the sink.
    _
     **Daphne:** Isn't he perfect, Dad?
      **Niles:** He certainly is, Mom.  He's got your eyes and my chin.
     **Daphne:** He's got my hair.
      **Niles:** You think so?
     **Daphne:** No, he's got my hair.  Let go, dear.
     **Rachel:** If you can part with him for just two seconds, I should finish 
             cleaning him up.
     **Daphne:** Of course.
      **Niles:** We can't thank you two enough.  
    _He looks at Dr. Hauck, whose mask is askew on his forehead, and who
    is struggling to remove his gloves._
      **Hauck:**[_modest wave_] Oh, please.
      **Niles:** Really, if there's ever anything that we can do for you...
     **Rachel:** You can do me one quick favor: my Jason is kind of overdue for 
             his lunch.
    _She indicates her monkey, perched on top of his cage._
      **Niles:** Oh, of course.
    _CUT TO: Waiting Room
    The room is empty.  Frasier, Martin, and Ronee come in, still wearing
    their wedding clothes._
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Niles?
     **Martin:** Boy, some day, huh?  Getting married and meeting my grandson 
             all in the same afternoon.
    _The door opens and there is Niles, holding a monkey tenderly under his
    arm and feeding him with a bottle._
      **Niles:** Hey, you guys!  You're just in time, come on in!
    _He goes back in, leaving the three gobsmacked._
     **Martin:**[_to a gaping Frasier_] Don't stare, you were no prize at that 
             age either!
    _Reset to: Examining Room
    Frasier, Martin and Ronee follow Niles in._
     **Daphne:** Oh, look who's here.  Hello.
    _Rachel enters from the washroom with the baby swaddled, and gives him 
    to Daphne._
     **Rachel:** Here we go!
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, he's beautiful!
      **Ronee:** Yeah, that twin's gonna be jealous his whole life.
     **Rachel:** Your ambulance should be here any minute, so I think I'm gonna 
             go.
      **Niles:** All right.  Thank you again.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.
      **Hauck:** Uh, you sure you don't want me to check your monkey?
     **Rachel:**[_embarrassed laugh_] Yeah, I'm sure.
    _She picks up Jason and his cage, and leaves.  Dr. Hauck excuses himself
    to the other room._
      **Niles:** Thank you.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.
     **Martin:**[_tickles the baby_] Hey there, you!  I'm the one who's gonna 
             spoil you rotten.
     **Daphne:** Oh, you're so sweet to come down.  But what about your 
             wedding, all those people?
     **Martin:** Oh, they'll keep.
      **Ronee:** Yeah, as long as there's an open bar.
     **Daphne:**[_to the baby_] Ooh!  Settle down there.
    _Niles looks nervous.  Outside they hear an ambulance siren._
      **Niles:** Oh, I guess that's our ride.  I'm so sorry we're going to miss 
             your wedding.
      **Ronee:** Oh, so are we.
     **Daphne:** I feel like it's me own dad getting married.
     **Martin:**[_pats her head_] Oh yeah, it's not gonna be the same without 
             you guys up there.
      **Niles:** Well, don't let me forget the rings.
    _He takes them out of his pocket._
      **Ronee:** Hey, wait a minute!  Why don't we just get married here?  
             I mean, we've got the rings, and-and the preacher...
     **Martin:** Well, what about all the guests?
      **Ronee:** Well, we can do it again for them later.  And at least this 
             place only smells like a monkey.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm game.  Get cracking, Fras!
    _Martin and Ronee stand on one side of the table.  Daphne lies there, 
    holding the baby.  Frasier and Niles stand on the other side, and 
    Frasier takes some speech cards from his pocket._
    **Frasier:** You know, I'd better, uh, condense this just a bit... [_reading 
             the cards_] No, I don't need that... and I don't need that.  
             All right... ah. [_begins_] "It was the great thinker Horace 
             Walpole..."
     **Martin:** Don't need that.
    **Frasier:**[_chucks the card_] Well, all right then, uh... "Dearly beloved, 
             we are gathered here..."
    _A paramedic, Rob, opens the door._
        **Rob:** Someone call for an ambulance?
     **Martin:** Just a couple seconds, please.
    _Rob looks puzzled, but obeys._
    **Frasier:** All right, Niles, uh, why don't you give them the rings?
      **Niles:**[_does_] Here.
    **Frasier:** I'll just cut to the chase here.  Uh, do you, Martin Crane 
             take Ronee Lawrence to be your lawfully wedded wife, forsaking 
             all others, until death do you part?
     **Martin:** I do.
    **Frasier:** Do you, Ronee Lawrence, take Martin Crane...?
      **Ronee:** I do!
    _As Martin fits the ring on her finger, Daphne laughs, choking up._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm tearing up.
    **Frasier:** You know, if they'd let me say what I planned to, you'd be 
             bawling your eyes out right now.
    _Martin puts the ring on and holds Ronee's hand._
    **Frasier:** By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
    _They kiss tenderly and hug.  Hugs and laughter follow all around. 
    Then Niles opens the door to Rob._
      **Niles:** We're ready now. [_to Martin and Ronee_] We're so happy for you 
             both.
     **Daphne:** Congratulations.
    _The paramedics wheel a gurney in, and Niles takes the baby as they 
    slide Daphne onto it._
      **Niles:** And, you will always remember your anniversary, because it's 
             the same day as your grandson's birthday.
     **Martin:** Yeah, and Eddie's!
      **Ronee:** What?
    _Frasier and Niles freeze._
     **Martin:** Uh, never mind.
      **Ronee:** Eddie's birthday is today?  So that's how you came up with May 
             15th for the hotel?  
     **Martin:** Uh...
      **Ronee:** I knew it!  And you've been blaming the inn all this time -- 
             oh, you are so busted!
    _She walks out, Martin follows her slowly.  Frasier, Niles, and Daphne
    watch him, concerned._
     **Martin:**[_to the boys_] That was a short honeymoon.
    _The paramedics wheel Daphne out.  Niles follows.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **AN IDLE KING**
    _Scene Eleven - Apartment
    It is evening, the rain is pouring outside.  Frasier is sitting on his
    couch, enjoying a book and a glass of sherry.  After a few minutes, he 
    closes his book, drains his glass, then picks up the cordless phone and 
    dials._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Lilith.  Hey, it's me.  Yeah, listen, I was just 
             calling to check out how Freddy's doing.  What, a new one?  
             I thought he was smitten with the old one.  Well, you know, 
             he gets that from me.  Back in my heyday, I had a new chess 
             coach every month. [_chuckles_] Well, I'm... spending a lot of 
             time alone lately.  Well, you know, Dad and Ronee are still 
             on their honeymoon.  Oh yes, they thank you for that very 
             thankful radon detector you sent.  Not seeing much of Niles 
             and Daphne either, because they're so busy with the baby... 
             Oh!  Uh, sorry to keep you.  Yeah, just, uh, just tell Freddy 
             to call me.  Okay, bye, Lilith.
    _He hangs up.  He goes to the balcony door and opens it, listening to 
    the sound of the rain.
    
    Someone rings the doorbell.  Frasier eagerly goes to answer it, to a 
    Moving Man._
    **Frasier:** Oh.
        **Man:** Here to pick up a chair?
    **Frasier:** Right.  It's right there.
    _He points to the chair, which has been marked with strips of red tape
    on the front._
        **Man:** Sorry I'm late.
    **Frasier:** It's all right.
        **Man:** Been waiting long?
    **Frasier:** Eleven years.
    _The Man levers the chair onto his dolly and wheels it to the door.
    But Frasier betrays some affection._
    **Frasier:** Uh, be careful with it.
    _The Man slips it through the door, and it is gone._
    [_N.B. Cleto Augusto reprises his role as the Moving Man who brought
    Martin's chair to the apartment eleven years ago in[[1.01]](/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_1/the_good_son.html "The Good Son") "The Good 
    Son."_]
    _Frasier contemplates the empty space where the chair was, then 
    joyfully brings the Eames from the upper landing down, and 
    places it in front of the TV, with its footstool.  He steps 
    back and surveys the tableau with satisfaction.
    
    He sits on the coffee table, looking around at his apartment.  
    For the first time in eleven years, he's on his own.  He should 
    be satisfied.  But after a minute, he realizes that he's not.
    
    He picks up the phone again._
    **Frasier:** Bebe, hi, it's Frasier.  Listen, about that San Francisco 
             job... I think I'll take it.
    _He hangs up.

    ACT FIVE
    
    Scene Twelve -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier takes his seat with Noel and Gil from KACL._
    
        **Gil:** Have you heard anything, Frasier?
    **Frasier:** About what?
       **Noel:** The new station manager.  They're announcing today.
        **Gil:** My stomach is in knots.  I just know they're going to 
             replace sweet, kind-hearted Kenny with some ruthless, 
             Draconian...
       **Noel:**...hard ass!
        **Gil:** That would hardly make up for it.
    _Noel and Frasier share a knowing glance.  The Agent of Hell enters 
    and disturbs the peace._
    
       **Bebe:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_standing_] Bebe.  Oh, I'll let you know if I hear anything, 
             guys. [_goes to Bebe_]
       **Bebe:** It's done.  When destiny calls, Bebe calls back and screws 
             destiny to the wall.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, yes.  Shush, shush.  I don't want anyone to find 
             out.  I'm not telling my family until this evening. 
             [_motions her to the window seat_]
       **Bebe:** I'm so proud of you.
    **Frasier:**[_digging in his pocket_] Oh, Bebe, listen, I have something 
             for you.  I've decided to give away some of the things that 
             I've accumulated through the years.  As sort of a... fresh 
             start, you know.
    
    _He hands her a piece of jewelry._
    
       **Bebe:** My baby's all grown up. [_She puts her hands on his face_] I 
             look in your eyes and I see something there that I've never 
             seen before.
    **Frasier:** Wisdom?
       **Bebe:** Crow's feet.  Sorry, darling, but you're going to be on TV 
             now.  I talked to my face man, he can see you at four 
             o'clock. [_dangles a card in front of him_]
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Bebe, but no thanks.
       **Bebe:** I'm not talking surgery.  Just talking a little tweaking,  
             twenty minutes.  I've used him for years.
    **Frasier:** And I'm sure he's very good at what he does, but still it's 
             just not me....
    _He is interrupted by a short, balding fat man in his late thirties,
    sticking his head round the door (Steve)._
    
      **Steve:** I'm done next door, so I'll be in the car, Mom.
    _He leaves.  Frasier looks back at Bebe in disbelief._
    [_N.B. To anyone who doubts that she's made a deal with Satan..._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_taking card_] Four o'clock it is.
    
    [_N.B. In Bebe's debut episode,[[1.09]](/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_9/selling_out.html "Selling Out") "Selling Out," she alluded to 
    a daughter who was about to graduate from university.  But no 
    episode after that mentioned any children._]
    _Bebe leaves in excitement and passes Roz who is talking on her cell 
    phone._
    
        **Roz:** Yeah.  Thank you.  Bye.
    _Noel's and Gil's ears have pricked up.  They join her with Frasier._
       **Noel:** You heard something, didn't you?
        **Roz:**[_dazed_] Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Roz, are you all right?
        **Gil:** Of course not.  She's ashen with terror.  Spit it out, Roz.  
             Who's the jack-booted tyrant whose fanny I'll be kissing 
             till God knows when?
        **Roz:** Me.
        **Gil:**[_kneeling_] Joyful news, your majesty.
    **Frasier:** You?!  Roz, congratulations!  Aren't you excited?
        **Roz:** I don't know.  It just hasn't sunk in yet.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's understandable.  I remember when I heard that 
             my advice would be heard by millions of people and...
        **Roz:**[_yelling in excitement_] It just sunk in!  I'm the boss!  
             Who wants to go have champagne?
    **Frasier:** Oh gosh, Roz, I'd love to, but I have to go to a doctor's 
             appointment.  Can you come to my place for dinner tonight?
        **Roz:** Sure.
    **Frasier:** Oh gosh, I'm so happy for you.
        **Roz:** I'm just so excited.
    _Overcome with excitement, she grabs Frasier and kisses him on the 
    lips.  Then she breaks and grabs Gil and kisses him on the lips.  
    Then it's Noel's turn...
    
    She stops, realizing that he's breathing shallowly, daring to hope.
    At first she's reluctant, but her excitement is so great that she 
    goes ahead and grabs Noel and kisses him on the lips.  Noel, seizing 
    the moment, throws his arms around her and returns the kiss 
    passionately, bending her backwards.
    
    After a while she finally manages to break free.  Noel looks 
    thoroughly satisfied and puts his arm around her._
        **Gil:** Well.  Was that worth waiting for?
       **Noel:**[_still breathing heavily_] He asked you a question, Roz.
    _FADE TO:_
    **TO STRIVE, TO SEEK, TO FIND**
    _Scene Thirteen -- Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier is on the phone in the kitchen.  He is playing with his 
    eyes.  They won't stop streaming with tears._
    
    **Frasier:** Bebe, it's Frasier.  When you get this, call me, please.  
             I want to thank you for sending me to that quack of yours 
             today!  He screwed something up and now my eyes won't stop 
             watering.
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Meanwhile, Daphne is opening the door to Roz.  Martin and Ronee are 
    already there, snuggled together on the couch now that the apartment 
    is chair-less._
    
     **Daphne:** There she is.
        **Roz:** Congratulations.
     **Daphne:** Well, and to you.
      **Ronee:** Hey, does anyone know what this big occasion is?  We had 
             plans and Frasier made us cancel.
     **Daphne:** We're not sure either.  He said he had some sort of an 
             announcement to make.
    
    _Niles enters with Baby Crane in his arms._
    
        **Roz:** Awww, there he is.
    
    _Daphne takes him._
    
      **Niles:** Hello, Roz.
    
    _Daphne sits with him on the couch._
    
     **Martin:**[_tickles him_] Hey, David, remember me?  I'm your grandpa.
     **Ronee:** [_tickles him_] Yes, and I'm your... Sorry, I just, I can't 
             say it yet.
    
    [_N.B. In memory of David Angell._]
    _Reset to: Kitchen
    Roz enters to find a teary Frasier._
        **Roz:** Frasier, I brought some champagne if... Were you just 
             crying?
    **Frasier:** No, no, Roz, of course not.  Listen, could you take these 
             out for me? [_passes her a tray of hors d'oeuvres_]
        **Roz:** Sure.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Roz returns._
    
        **Roz:** Is Frasier okay?
     **Martin:** Sure, why?
        **Roz:** Well, I think he was crying in the kitchen.  I hope he's 
             okay.  He's been at the doctor an awful lot lately.
      **Niles:** Has he?
        **Roz:** Yeah, he went today and he missed a whole show because of 
             an appointment last week.
     **Martin:** He hasn't said anything to us.
    
    _Frasier enters with a serving tray and a china plate._
    
    **Frasier:** Ronee, I saw you admiring this China pattern.
      **Ronee:** Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I'd like to make a gift of them to you as a 
             complete set.
      **Ronee:** Gosh, Frasier, thank you.
    **Frasier:** Of course.  Oh, Niles, I know how much you've always 
             coveted this chess set. [_holds it up_]  And I want you to 
             have it.
      **Niles:** But this is your favourite.  This is the one you learned 
             on.
    **Frasier:** Which is why I want it to be the set that you teach that 
             son of yours to play on.  I haven't forgot about you, Roz.  
             I'll be right back.
    _Niles is left speechless.  Frasier leaves concern in his wake._
        **Roz:** I don't like this.
      **Niles:** Well, now, let's not get alarmed.  It's marriage in the air 
             and a new baby, it's just brought out his sentimental side.
    _The phone begins to ring and Roz goes to answer the phone.  But the
    machine picks up first._
     **Doctor:**[_v.o. on machine_] Frasier, it's Dr. Hanning.  I'm really 
             sorry about your results.  I know it doesn't look good but, 
             um, I'm going to do everything I can for you.  Call me.
    
    [_N.B. Rob Hanning wrote for the show._]
    _This confirms the suspicion._
     **Daphne:** Oh my God...
     **Martin:** Do you think that's why he brought us all here tonight?
    _Frasier returns in high spirits with another gift._
    **Frasier:** Here we are, Roz.  I thought this art deco mirror seemed 
             like you.
    _He passes it to her, causing an immediate fit of emotion.  She sobs 
    deeply._
    **Frasier:** Well that just shows you.  I thought I'd get the bigger 
             reaction from the chess set.
      **Niles:** Frasier, what's going on here?
     **Martin:** Yeah, giving all your stuff away? You're not going 
             anywhere, are you...?
    **Frasier:** Well, I didn't want to say anything until after dinner so 
             as not to bring down the party, but...
    _Roz moans in tears again._
    **Frasier:** I see you're all ahead of me.  Uh... listen, a couple of 
             weeks ago I got some unexpected news.
    _The emotion hits Niles.  He begins to sob._
    **Frasier:** Now you see, this is exactly what I was trying to avoid.  
             You mustn't think of my leaving you as a sad thing, because 
             I don't.  I think of it as an adventure.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Frasier, no....
    _Daphne falls into tears._
    **Frasier:** We all knew we weren't going to stay together forever.  I 
             mean, that's not what life is about.  Cry, if you must, but 
             I assure you, when I pass through that Golden Gate I will 
             be smiling!
    _This is the last straw for Martin and he falls into tears._
     **Martin:**[_in utter misery_] Golden Gate?
    **Frasier:** Yes!  That's where I'm moving to!  San Francisco!
    _A beat.  The tears begin to dry, evaporated by their astonishment._
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** My new job.  I start next week.  Now don't just sit there 
             choking back the tears.  Go ahead, let them out.
    _They instead begin laughing hysterically and hugging each other.  
    Frasier is mystified.
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Fourteen -- Frasier's Apartment
    The scene cuts to the end of the party.  Frasier, Martin and Niles 
    are having brandy out on the balcony together as Roz, Daphne and 
    Ronee sit in the living room.  _
    
      **Niles:** To San Francisco.
    **Frasier:** To San Francisco.
     **Martin:** To San Francisco.
    _They clink glasses and take a swig - Martin's swig being 
    considerably larger... what with finishing off the glass._
    **Frasier:** You know it's just an hour by plane, so I'll be coming back 
             up as often as you like.
     **Martin:** We know, Fras.  Don't worry about us.
      **Niles:** We're happy for you.
    **Frasier:** I'm happy for myself.  And scared too.  But it's a good 
             scared.  Sort of the way I felt when I came here from 
             Boston.  If I hadn't done that, just think of what I would 
             have missed out on.
      **Niles:** And, look what I would have missed out on. [_looking over at 
             Daphne and David_] God, they are so beautiful.
     **Martin:** And they'll stay like that as long as she keeps breast 
             feeding.
    _Frasier and Niles share glances as Martin heads inside.  Daphne 
    enters from the other door._
     **Daphne:** Niles, could you take the baby?  I need to get a blanket.
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Frasier and Niles enter the living room to find Martin snugly laid 
    out on Frasier's designer Eames chair._
    
     **Martin:** Mmmm, well this is pretty comfortable.  I would have been 
             okay with this!
    _Frasier wishes to die._
    **Frasier:**[_changing subject_] Let me just help you with some of those 
             dishes.
    _Frasier exits to the kitchen as Niles lays David down._
     **Martin:** Ahh, handsome boy.
      **Niles:** Yes.  And to think I had myself all worked up worrying that 
             we would have nothing in common.
     **Martin:** Oh, I've been there, Niles.  It all works out.
    
    _Ronee enters from the kitchen._
    
      **Ronee:** Well, Marty, we better get going.  I've got a crazy 
             morning.
        **Roz:** Me too.  I've got a seven-thirty and then I've got to fire 
             someone.
     **Daphne:** Who?
        **Roz:** Whoever scheduled the seven-thirty meeting!
    _Niles and Daphne, meanwhile, are tending to David._
     **Daphne:** We should go too, honey.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, if you really must go, all right, but I tell you 
             what, don't go without taking some of these eclairs with 
             you.  
    _As everyone heads for the door, the camera focuses on Frasier 
    rushing in and out of the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** I'm on TV next week and the only thing worse than seeing 
             them going to waste would be seeing them go to my waist!
    _Frasier chuckles at his own word play as he enters the living room 
    with the eclairs.  He is surprised to find everyone stood waiting 
    for him, heartbroken.  _
    
    **Frasier:** What?
    _Roz puts down the art deco mirror and moves towards him._
        **Roz:** Does it mean you're really leaving? [_chokes up_] What will 
             I ever do without you? [_hugging him dearly_] You're the 
             sweetest, most wonderful...
     **Martin:** It's okay, Roz.  He's not going till next week.
    **Frasier:** Let her talk, Dad!
        **Roz:** You've always been just like a brother to me. [_breaking 
             hug_] Which is weird, I know, because we slept together, 
             but...  
    _She hugs him again.  Daphne puts her bag down._
     **Daphne:** Ooh, move over, Roz. [_goes to hug him_] Do you know how many 
             operas I'm gonna get dragged to now you're not around?
    **Frasier:** Well, I promise I'll fly up for all the German ones!
     **Martin:** Yeah, and he'll be here for Christmas... and 
             Thanksgiving... and birthdays... and... [_convincing 
             himself_] We'll be sick of this guy!
    **Frasier:** Yeah, Dad's right.  I mean, once I'm gone there'll be no 
             getting rid of me.
    _Frasier moves towards his father.  Martin begins to tear up as he 
    puts his hand on his son's face._
    
     **Martin:** Thank you, Frasier.  For... well, you know.
    _They hug in a special moment that is so much more than the "one 
    lousy thank you" which Frasier begged of his father in "The Good 
    Son."_
      **Ronee:** Go get �em, kid.
    **Frasier:** Sure.
    _They briefly hug.  Frasier then turns around to his dear brother and 
    respected friend, Niles._
    
      **Niles:** You already made me cry once tonight.  That's quite enough.
    **Frasier:** Right.  Coffee tomorrow?
      **Niles:** Ten-thirty.
    _They shake hands.  After all, "a handshake is as good as a hug,"
    as their mother once told them._
    
      **Niles:** I'll miss the coffees.
    _The tears begin to spring as they denounce their mother's sentiments 
    and hug tenderly._
    
    **Frasier:** I love you.
    _Frasier and Niles break the hug as Frasier turns to everyone._
    **Frasier:** You all know how I feel about you, and the only reason I'm 
             leaving is because I want what all of you have now: a new 
             chapter.  Who knows if it'll even work out? [_looking to 
             Martin_] But it's like that Tennyson poem Mom had us recite 
             for you when we were kids.  Do you remember?
     **Martin:** I think we're about to.
    
    _Martin happily listens to Frasier's final quote._
    
    **Frasier:** It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,
             It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
                                                 and though 
             We are not now that strength which in old days
             Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Fifteen -- KACL
    The scene dissolves into the radio station as Frasier delivers his 
    final show.  He is finishing the same Tennyson poem.  Roz is in the
    producer's chair, and a whole crowd of KACL staff is standing behind 
    her in the booth, including Kenny, Noel, Gil, and Bebe.
    _
    **Frasier:** Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
    	   To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
    
    _Frasier gives Roz a glance of weary happiness.
    
    As he delivers his farewell remarks, the camera slowly pans around 
    until we are left with an image of Frasier finishing his show whilst 
    another crowd, including Niles, Daphne, Martin, Ronee and little 
    David watch silently on from behind the glass, in the corridor._
    **Frasier:** I've been thinking about that poem a lot lately.  And I 
             think what it says is that, while it's tempting to play 
             it safe, the more we're willing to risk, the more alive 
             we are.  In the end, what we regret most are the chances 
             we never took.  And I hope that explains a little this 
             journey on which I'm about to embark.  I have loved every 
             minute with my KACL family and all of you.  For eleven 
             years you have heard me say, "I'm listening."  Well, you 
             were listening too.  And for that I am eternally grateful.  
             Goodnight, Seattle.
    
    _Frasier hangs up his headphones for the final time.
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Sixteen -- Airplane Cabin
    The scene dissolves back to the present as Frasier finishes his story 
    to Anne Ranberg, his fellow airline passenger.
    _
    **Frasier:** We had a big party that night.  It was all very sweet.
    
    _The plane jolts._
    
       **Anne:** What was that?
    **Frasier:** Oh, good heavens. [_looking out of window_] We've touched 
             down.
       **Anne:** Already? [_laughs in amazement_] Well, thank you so much, 
             I've never had an easier flight.
    **Frasier:** And I've never had more delightful company.
    _Beat._
       **Anne:** I think it's great what you're doing.
    **Frasier:** Well, I just know I'd always regret it if I didn't take the 
             chance.
    _Frasier and Anne sit in silence as the pilot announces their arrival._
      **Pilot:**[_v.o_] Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to Chicago...
    
    _So it ended with a twist._
    
    **Frasier:**[_with nervous excitement_] Wish me luck.
    
    _Frasier prepares for the new chapter.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT FIVE
    Farewell.
    
    Auf Weidersehn.
