## A Personal Note

    
    
    This will be the last transcript I contribute to "The Frasier Files."  
    It has been a joy and an honor to be associated with this wonderful 
    site for the past three years, and I would like to thank Nick Hartley 
    and Mike Lee for putting up with me when I was late and for the 
    opportunity that I was always given to transcribe episodes with my 
    personal interpretations and methods.  One gains even more appreciation 
    for the writers of this greatest of comedies when actually typing the 
    brilliant dialogue and stories they have created.  I am both wistful 
    and happy that my last transcript includes one of my favorite 
    characters, Charlotte.  Thanks to everybody who gave my work positive 
    feedback through Nick or Mike, and I hope that as the DVD's are 
    released, the site will continue to grow and become even more thorough 
    than it already is.  Mike has worked tirelessly to make this site 
    great, and deserves praise for it.  Thank you again -- to the 
    webmasters, the readers, and of course, to the show for providing me 
    this unique opportunity.

    **Skyline:** A crane is seen on the horizon lifting a load.
    
    _ACT I
    
    Scene 1 -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier enters happily._
    
    **Frasier:** Can I get my usual, please?
    
    _He sits at a table with Roz._
    
        **Roz:** Well, you're in a good mood.  What's up?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually... no, I'd better not.  Don't want to jinx it.
        **Roz:** No problem.
    **Frasier:** Besides, the mark of a-a true gentleman is discretion.
        **Roz:**[_not as interested as Frasier wants her to be_] Okay.  Listen, 
             about your dad's bachelor party...
    **Frasier:** Charlotte and I spent the night together.
        **Roz:** I thought she was seeing that super-hottie Frank.
    **Frasier:** Dumped him, thank you.
        **Roz:** For you? [_then_] I mean, wow, way to go!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know.  It's funny I should end up with my own 
             matchmaker, isn't it?
        **Roz:** Yeah, I mean that Frank was the whole package.  Those eyes, 
             that chin, that bod that wouldn't quit...
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it didn't have to quit, it was fired.
    
    _Frasier's coffee arrives._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you very much. [_to Roz_] Now, you were saying something 
             about my dad's bachelor party?
        **Roz:** Yeah.  Weren't you having a problem deciding on the 
             entertainment?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.
        **Roz:** Well, there's this girl in my spin class, and she does it all -- 
             strips, lap dances, movies.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Would I be familiar with her work?
        **Roz:** I don't know, have you seen "Grinding Nemo"?  Anyway, I invited 
             her over here so you could check her out.  She's going to be 
             here any second.  Her name is Amber Licious.
    **Frasier:** Really, well, I'm afraid I can't do it right now.  I'm meeting 
             Charlotte for coffee, uh-
        **Roz:** Well, you can tell her yourself.  Hey, Amber!
    
    _Amber rushes in.  She is a busty blonde with a wide smile.  Roz and 
    Frasier rise._ 
          
        **Roz:** How are you?
      **Amber:** Hi!
        **Roz:** This is Frasier.
    
    _Amber shakes hands with him._
    
      **Amber:** Hello.
    **Frasier:**[_after mumbling a bit_] Hello, uh, how do you do, Miss Licious?  
             Uh, I'm terribly sorry, but I've got something scheduled, so 
             I'll have to postpone our interview.  Perhaps we could meet 
             this evening at my place, around 7:00?  I live at the Elliot 
             Bay Towers.
      **Amber:** Can we make it 7:30?  I have to go re-dub some groans for 
             "He-Biscuit."
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll see you then.  Good.
    
    _Charlotte enters the cafe wearing a business suit._
    
    **Charlotte:** Frasier?
    
    _Frasier runs to join her.  Amber sits down by Roz._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh, hi!  Listen, I... gosh, I'm sorry I had to dash off this 
               morning.
    **Charlotte:** It's OK.  I have to dash off myself right now.
      **Frasier:** Oh, I thought we were having coffee.
    **Charlotte:** We were.  I forgot - I have to catch a train to Portland 
               in twenty minutes.  I'm giving a talk to the Northwest 
               Businesswoman's Association.  I'm sorry.
      **Frasier:** Oh, no, it's all right.  I'm sure you'll be wonderful.
    **Charlotte:** Oh, yeah, it's a good speech.  I gave it last year to the 
               Midwest Businesswoman's Association.  Anyway, I'll be back 
               Sunday night.  We can have dinner then.  I really should 
               catch a cab.
      **Frasier:** Wait, maybe I could just drive you to the station.
    **Charlotte:** Oh, you don't have to do that.
      **Frasier:** No, no, I'd like to.  Besides, I've always been a sucker for 
               that romantic movie-ending goodbye - a fog-shrouded train 
               platform, a-a passionate kiss.
    **Charlotte:**[_agreeing_] With a romantic dip.
      **Frasier:** Yes, well, maybe I am, but there are damn few of us left.
    
    _Charlotte leans back, demonstrating what she meant._
    
    **Charlotte:** Dip, dip.
      **Frasier:** Oh!
    
    _Frasier takes her hand, getting it.  Charlotte smiles.  
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    _Scene 2 - On the road in Frasier's car
    Frasier is discussing dinner plans.  Charlotte is deep in thought._
    
      **Frasier:** So, I could make us a reservation for dinner on Sunday.  
               I would suggest Cucina...
    **Charlotte:**[_distracted_] Yeah, okay.
      **Frasier:** Charlotte... you seem a little distracted.  Is there 
               something on your mind?  Charlotte?
    **Charlotte:** Oh, Frasier.
      **Frasier:** Oh, boy.
    **Charlotte:** Look, I-I really don't want to get into this now.  Why don't 
               we talk about it Sunday night?
    
    _He parks the car._
    
      **Frasier:**[_very worried_] Please.  I can't wait till Sunday.  My 
               imagination will torture me.
    **Charlotte:** Okay. [_pause_] I'm moving back to Chicago in three weeks.
      **Frasier:** Three weeks?!
    **Charlotte:** It's not you.  I bought my old business back from my ex.  
               I--I know I should have told you sooner, but it was never 
               the right time.  
    
    _There is a pause.  She reaches out and touches his shoulder._
    
    **Charlotte:** Are you okay?
    
    _His facial expressions alone are enough to answer that question._
    
      **Frasier:**[_under his breath_] I had to blab to Roz.
    **Charlotte:** What?
      **Frasier:**[_very sad_] Nothing.  Are you sure?
    **Charlotte:** This all happened before we got together.
      **Frasier:** Well, let's look on the bright side.  I mean, Chicago isn't 
               that far away.
    **Charlotte:** I don't want a long-distance relationship.  And neither do 
               you.  You said so on your application.
      **Frasier:** Okay.  But, you know, we still have three weeks.
    **Charlotte:** Don't be hurt, but... if someone called your show and said, 
               "I'm leaving town in three weeks.  Should I get involved 
               with someone?" what would you say?
      **Frasier:** I'd say it was foolish to take the plunge and bring up 
               feelings that must be dashed, and so forth.  But what do 
               I know?  I'm not infallible.
    **Charlotte:**[_smiling wistfully_] Frasier...
      **Frasier:**[_resigned_] All right.
    
    _He unbuckles his seat belt, and they embrace.  He caresses her gently.  
    A train whistle is heard, and the train itself rushes by._
    
    **Charlotte:** Son of a bitch!
      **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry.  My hand slipped.
    **Charlotte:** No, no, it's my train!  Damn it!      
      **Frasier:** Oh, dear.  All right, look, the next station isn't too far.  
               I'll bet I can beat the train.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 3 - Frasier's car
    Time fade to another train station.  Charlotte looks on forlornly as 
    the whistle is heard and the train rushes by._
    
      **Frasier:** Well.  Round two to Amtrak.  I could drive us to the next 
               station?
    **Charlotte:** All right, but, you do know you're going to have to drive a
               little faster.  You do realize we got passed by a school bus 
               and a prefab home.
      **Frasier:** Point taken.
    
    _Frasier starts to drive again._
    
    **Charlotte:** I really do appreciate this.
      **Frasier:**[_clearly still smarting_] Oh, it's all right.  Didn't have 
               anything else to do. [_then, realizing_] Oh, dear.  I've got 
               to make a call.  Could you hold the wheel, please?
    
    _She does.  Frasier fumbles around with the wires and earpiece of a  
    phone unit._
    
    **Frasier:** I just got this.  It's a... it's a hands-free unit.  It's, uh, 
             much, uh, much, much safer.
    
    _He finally gets the unit in his ear and retakes the wheel, but the 
    mouthpiece is pointing straight up.
    
    CUT TO:
    Cafe Nervosa, where Daphne and Niles are speaking._
    
     **Daphne:** Can't we just meet her?  Everyone in Frasier's building raves 
             about her, and I hear she's unhappy.
    
    _Niles's coffee arrives._
    
      **Niles:** I just hate the idea of poaching the Steingartens' nanny.
     **Daphne:** I seem to recall you poaching another man's fiancee once.
      **Niles:** Oh, Daphne, I was in college.  I... [_off her look_] oh, you 
             mean...
    
    _His cell phone rings._ 
    
     **Daphne:** Well, who did you mean?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I have to get this.  Hello?
    **Frasier:**[_v.o._] Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    
    _CUT back to the car._
    
    **Frasier:** Listen, you remember that idea we proposed about Dad's party?
    
    _Charlotte somewhat playfully moves the mouthpiece down to its proper 
    place._
    
    **Frasier:** The, uh, the entertainer. [_To Charlotte_] Oh. 
    
    _CUT back to Caf e._
    
      **Niles:** The klezmer band?
    
    _CUT back to car.  Charlotte's hand is still flirtatiously near 
    Frasier's face after moving the mouthpiece._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no, the stripper.
    
    _He chuckles at Charlotte.  She smiles and moves back her hand._
    
    **Frasier:** Uh, well, I found one!
    
    _CUT back to Cafe._
    
      **Niles:**[_nervously_] Daphne's fine, thank you for asking!  She's right 
             here beside me.
    
    _He gestures his head toward her.  CUT back to car._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, I'm supposed to interview her this evening at 7:30 at 
             my place.  I can't make it.  Something came up.  You'll have 
             to do it for me.
    
    _CUT back to Cafe._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, no thank you!
    
    _He smiles stupidly and winks at Daphne.  CUT back to car._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, if you're worried about Dad being there, he's got a 
             date with Ronee tonight.
    
    _CUT back to Cafe.  Niles chuckles nervously.  CUT back to car._
    
    **Charlotte:** Don't we want south?
      **Frasier:** Listen, Niles, I-I know that you get nervous around fan 
               dancers and their ilk, but you have got to conquer your 
               fear...
    
    _CUT back to Caf e.  Niles looks resigned._
    
    **Frasier:**[_v.o., continuing_] Thank you!  I'll talk to you later.  
             Goodbye.
    
    _He cuts off the call.  CUT back to car._
    
    **Charlotte:**[_nervously_] South!
      **Frasier:** What, I'm sorry?
    **Charlotte:** South!!  South!!
      **Frasier:** What?  What?
    **Charlotte:**[_craning her neck as they pass the turnoff_] SOUTH!! 
      **Frasier:** Oh, dear, uh, you know, perhaps it would be best if you just 
               said left or right.  It's not like there's a compass in the 
               car.
    
    _She looks at the dashboard._
    
    **Charlotte:** What's that?
      **Frasier:** Oh, well, I'll be damned.
    **Charlotte:**[_notices something else_] What's that red light?
      **Frasier:** Oh, that.  Uh, that's nothing to worry about.  It's been on 
               for months.  I think there's something wrong with the bulb.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene 4 - Dissolve to night
    The "door open" warning beeps.  Charlotte looks forlornly at her cell 
    phone.  Frasier enters the car._
    
    **Charlotte:**[_with an ironic smile_] Cell phones don't work here.  Please 
               tell me you know what's wrong with the car?
      **Frasier:** Not a clue.  I opened the hood as a mere formality.
    
    _Charlotte sighs.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **NEIGHBORS DESCRIBED
    JONATHAN AS A NICE BOY
    WHO KEPT TO HIMSELF**
    
    _Scene 5 - A country home
    A knock.  A rustic, pleasant woman opens the door to Frasier and 
    Charlotte._
    
        **Sue:** Hello?
    **Frasier:** We're terribly sorry to bother you, but, uh, our car has broken 
             down.
        **Sue:** Well, come on in out of that cold!
    
    _She escorts them in.  The husband is seated at the table._
    
        **Sue:** My husband knows everything about cars.  Harbin, these people's 
             car broke down.  Go take a look at it for them.  Harbin!
    
    _Harbin looks up with rather wild eyes.  He crashes something on the 
    table and heads outside, mumbling unintelligibly under his breath._
    
      **Frasier:**[_as he passes_] Thank you!  Thank you very much.  We 
               certainly appreciate that.
          **Sue:** Well, just have a seat and have a cup of coffee and warm up.  
               I'm Sue, by the way.
    **Charlotte:** Thank you.  You're very kind.
      **Frasier:** Yes, yes, indeed.
    **Charlotte:** I'm Charlotte.
      **Frasier:** And I'm Frasier.
    
    _She starts to pour them some coffee._
    
      **Frasier:** Gosh, you seem to be preparing for some sort of party.
          **Sue:** Well, Harbin's mother passed away, so people will be coming 
               over tomorrow.
    **Charlotte:** Oh, my God!  I'm-I'm so sorry.  We should get out of your 
               hair.
    
    _She and Frasier rise and head for the door._
    
          **Sue:** Oh, no, please!  The company will do us good.  I mean, Harbin 
               really perked up when you came in.
    **Charlotte:**[_looking out the door_] Really?  Because he seems to be crying 
               in our car.
    
    _Sue walks toward the door._
    
        **Sue:** Excuse me.
    
    _She opens the door and shouts to her husband._
    
        **Sue:** Harbin!  For goodness sake, pop the hood!
    
    _She shuts the door and sighs with her hand to her head._
    
        **Sue:** You will have to excuse him.  He was _very_ attached to his
             mother.  A little too attached for my tastes. [_Then_] Hi, baby!  
             Hi!
    _She walks to greet her son, who has entered.  Jonathan is dressed in a
    "stalker" type outfit of thermal underwear under a short-sleeve shirt.  
    He has a bald head, walks leaning backward with a sort of "reverse" 
    hunchback, and is very creepy._
    
    **Jonathan:** Who are these?
    
    _Charlotte and Frasier exchange a glance._
    
         **Sue:** Their car broke down.  This is my son, Jonathan. [_She caresses 
              him._] Isn't he handsome?  Jonathan, this is Frasier and 
              Charlotte.
    **Jonathan:** How do you do?
     **Frasier:** Yes, nice to meet you...
    
    _Frasier holds out his hand, but Jonathan walks right past him and 
    extends his hand to Charlotte, who reluctantly shakes it._
    
         **Sue:** How is your project today, baby?
    **Jonathan:**[_impatiently_] Fine, mother. [_To Charlotte_] You want a 
              butterscotch?
    
    _He reaches inside his pocket._
    
    **Charlotte:** No, I-I'm good.  I'm good.  So, what are you making?
    
    _A long beat._
    
        **Sue:** Art.  He won't let any of us see it until it's finished.
    
    _Harbin re-enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh.  So, uh, how's our car?  Can we just scoot right away from 
             here?
     **Harbin:** No.  I'll-I'll have to drive to town tomorrow for the parts. 
             So, what happened?
    **Frasier:** Well, we were just, uh, driving along the highway, and then 
             suddenly the engine just died.
     **Harbin:**[_sobbing_] Excuse me.
    _He walks out of the kitchen and exits to the living room, crying._
    
        **Sue:** Excuse me.
    
    _She follows her husband.  Jonathan looks on from the doorway.  
    Frasier and Charlotte are increasingly uncomfortable._
    
         **Sue:**[_o.s._] Will you please cut out the hangdog bit, Mr. Welcome
              Wagon?  We've got company!  Get in there, show them some 
              manners.  Offer them a place to stay for the night.
    **Jonathan:** You're not going to like it here.
    
    _Harbin and Sue re-enter._
    
       **Harbin:** Of course, uh, of course you'll have to spend the night.
      **Frasier:** We couldn't.
    **Charlotte:** No, we really, _really_ couldn't.  There must be a hotel 
               in town.
    
    _They start to exit._
    
    **Jonathan:** What does this look like, Lancaster?
    
    _Sue laughs.  Frasier and Charlotte look at each other in horror._
    
          **Sue:** It's no problem.  You could bunk with Jonathan, and 
               Charlotte, you could have the fold-out.
     **Jonathan:**[_suggestively_] I'll help make up your bed...
    **Charlotte:** No, that's OK!  We'll-we'll stay together.
      **Frasier:** Yes, that's right, together.
          **Sue:** Oh, well, are you married?  Because we don't want to set a 
               bad example for... [_motions with her head toward Jonathan_]
      **Frasier:** Oh yes, yes.
    **Charlotte:** We're married!
      **Frasier:** Yes, married.
          **Sue:** For how long?
    **Frasier/Charlotte:**[_simultaneously_] Oh, two years./Eighteen months.
    
    _FADE OUT_
    
    _END OF ACT I
    
    ACT II_
    
    _Scene 6 - Frasier's apartment
    Martin is speaking on the phone._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Ronee.  It's me.  Uh, I've got to interview a new 
             physical therapist to fill in for Daph, so pick me up 
             fifteen minutes later, OK? [_Pause_] Just have a drink. 
             [_Pause_] Well, have another one. [_Pause, concerned look_] 
             Really?  Maybe I'll pick you up.
    
    _He hangs up.  
    
    CUT to Niles in the elevator, also on the phone._
    
      **Niles:**[_stiltedly_] Frasier?  You're too busy to answer the phone --
             but I'm just about to interview this... stripper, and I have 
             no idea what to ask.
    
    _He exits the elevator and heads toward the apartment._
    
      **Niles:** I just hope Dad doesn't walk in and spoil the surprise.  I'm 
             Already developing some sort of aversion-based mouth dryness 
             as we speak. [_Then_] This is Niles, by the way.
    
    _He enters the apartment.  Martin emerges from the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles!
      **Niles:**[_nervous_] Oh!
     **Martin:** What's up?
      **Niles:**[_stilted again_] Frasier is going to split a case of oloroso 
             with me because we both like oloroso, but he's not here, so 
             I'll stop bothering you.  Nice chatting.
    
    _He blocks his nostril and sniffs, his characteristic "nosebleed of 
    untruth" about to set in.  He exits.  Martin looks after him with 
    puzzlement.  
    
    Reset to: Hall
    In the hall, Niles runs into a young woman (Becky) wearing a sweat 
    outfit, and carrying a manila folder._
    
      **Niles:** Oh!  Are you here for the interview?
      **Becky:** Yes.  Crane, right?
      **Niles:** Um, yes. [_He gasps a bit with mouth dryness._] Um, the place is 
             a mess.  Do you - do you mind if we talk in the lobby?
      **Becky:** I guess that's okay.
    
    _He escorts her into the elevator.  As it starts to go down, she smiles 
    a bit uncomfortably.  Niles becomes very stilted now._
    
      **Niles:** Um, so, um, how -- uh - how long have you been doing what you 
             do?
      **Becky:** Oh, years now.  At first I just did it for friends, but then I 
             thought, "Why am I giving this away when I can make money at 
             it?"
    
    _Niles nods nervously.  She hands him a paper._
    
      **Becky:** Here are my references.
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, I -- ahem - didn't know you people had references.  Let 
             alone... the mayor?
      **Becky:** Yeah.  I started with him, and now I do most of the city 
             council.
    
    _Niles again gasps a bit with the mouth dryness, and hands her back the 
    list._
    
      **Niles:** Well...uh, that--that's good enough for me.  You're hired.  
      **Becky:** Shouldn't your dad meet me before you decide?
      **Niles:** Oh, no, no.  We--we don't want him to see you till you're 
             taking off your clothes.
      **Becky:** What are you talking about?  And why are you sweating so much?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry.  I'm just--I'm just a little ill-at-ease around...
      **Becky:** What?
      **Niles:**[_fighting the mouth dryness mightily and finally stammering_] 
             Sex workers.
      **Becky:** Ew!  Get away from me, you freak!
    _The elevator reaches the lobby, and she rushes out.  Daphne is waiting. 
    Niles sees her and immediately tries to compose himself._
    
      **Niles:** Hi.
     **Daphne:**[_not expecting to see him_] Hi.  What are you doing here and 
             why are you so sweaty?
      **Niles:**[_sniffing again_] I was talking to Dad about my case of 
             oloroso.
     **Daphne:** Oh.  Well, if it doesn't clear up by tomorrow, you should call 
             a doctor.
      **Niles:** I will.
    
    [_N.B. Oloroso -- a variety of sherry._]
    
    _He rushes away, holding the nostril tightly.  Daphne enters the 
    elevator, talking on her cell phone._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh!  Hello, Kathy?  Yeah, it's Daphne Crane.  Listen, I'm 
             going to be up in 1901, and I was wondering if we could 
             finally meet.  Oh, that's wonderful!  Don't even call it an 
             interview.  Everyone says you're the best nanny in Seattle.  
             Good, I'll see you up there then.
    
    _The door closes.  Upon her arrival, Daphne exits to find Amber waiting 
    at the door._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, wow, that was fast.  Come on in.
      **Amber:**[_confused_] All right, what happened to Dr. Crane?
     **Daphne:** He's not feeling well.
    
    _They enter._
    
     **Daphne:** Thanks for coming.  I know you're busy.  Please, have a seat.
      **Amber:** Oh, thanks.  Teah, right after this I have to go pick up a new 
             teddy. 
     **Daphne:** Oh, that's so sweet.
    
    _They both giggle as they sit down._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I'll make this quick then.  We're not expecting anything 
             fancy.  Just the basic burping, diapering, and so forth.
      **Amber:** O-kay, I guess I'm game for that.
     **Daphne:** Oh, wonderful!  Why don't I make some tea and we can talk.
    
    _She rises and moves toward the kitchen._
    
      **Amber:** Great!  Uh, did you want me to wear something special?       
     **Daphne:** Oh!  Since you asked, I've always been partial to a simple 
             white nurse's uniform.
      **Amber:** It's a classic.
    
    _She exits.  Martin emerges from the rear._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, I thought I heard some talking out here!  I'm Marty 
             Crane.
      **Amber:** Hi.
     **Martin:** How you doing?
      **Amber:** Great.
    
    _She rises to shake his hand._
    
     **Martin:** So, Daphne give you the third degree?
      **Amber:** Oh, not really.
     **Martin:** Oh, well, that's good.  I think she's a little sensitive, 
             you know, about being replaced.  She's been doing me for 
             ten years.
      **Amber:** Oh!  But then she got pregnant.
     **Martin:** Right, right.  But you know, lately, she's been having me up 
             on the table.  I like it better on the floor.  The floor all 
             right with you?
      **Amber:** It's your dime.
     **Martin:** Well, uh, maybe you could show me your stuff.
      **Amber:** Oh...
     **Martin:** I'll, uh, never hear the end of it if I don't take you out for 
             a spin.
      **Amber:** Oh, sure.  I just need to change.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, the powder room's right there.
      **Amber:** Here?  Okay.
    
    _She goes in the room to change.  Daphne re-enters._
    
     **Daphne:** Where did she go?  You didn't drive her off, did you?
     **Martin:** No, not at all.  I like her.  What do you think about her?
     **Daphne:** I like her a lot.
     **Martin:** Good.  Of course, we won't really know until we see her in 
             action.
    
    _Amber now enters, wearing a red lingerie outfit and posing._
    
      **Amber:** Ta-da!
     **Martin:**[_grinning broadly_] You're hired! 
    
    _FADE TO:_
    
    _Scene 7 - The country home
    Charlotte is seated at the table with Sue and Jonathan.  Frasier enters 
    with Harbin, carrying Charlotte's suitcase._
    
    **Charlotte:**[_desperately, forcing a smile_] Hi, sweetie!  You've been 
               gone for twenty minutes!
      **Frasier:** Yes.  Well, uh, Harbin was just giving me a tour of my 
               engine.
       **Harbin:** You've got either a blown rod bearing or a loose pin.  If we 
               had a stethoscope, I'm sure we could tell the difference.
      **Frasier:** Yes, well, you know, I'm so hopeless with cars.  I know I 
               would just misdiagnose it.
       **Harbin:** Wouldn't be the first misdiagnosis that ever happened.
    
    _He exits to the living room._
    
     **Jonathan:** Friend Charlotte.  Where's your ring?
    **Charlotte:** Excuse me?
     **Jonathan:** I thought most married women wore a ring, yet your hand is 
               bare and white.
    
    _She takes Frasier's hand, looking up at him pleadingly for help._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, it-it is.  That's because this is the hand that I fell in 
             love with.  A hand too... too perfect for, uh... the profanity 
             of gold or-or platinum. [_He sits, looking at her face._] After 
             all, what diamond could possibly rival the sparkle in those 
             eyes?
    
    _During this speech, it is very clear the most of the sentiments he 
    expresses are real, and not just spoken for Jonathan's benefit.  
    Charlotte's flattered response to his words is also natural.
    
    The moment they share is very brief, but palpable.  Harbin suddenly 
    enters._
     **Harbin:** I'll take my coffee in the living room, _you don't mind!_
    
    _He returns there._
    
        **Sue:** If that will make you _happy_ , Harbin.  Shall we?
    
    _Sue and Jonathan follow to the living room.  Frasier and Charlotte 
    share a look of great trepidation.  They follow... and stop dead in 
    their tracks when they see a coffin in the living room._
    
    **Jonathan:**[_presenting the coffin, matter-of-factly_] This is Grandma.
     **Frasier:** We... had no idea.
         **Sue:** We... are having the wake here tomorrow.
      **Harbin:**[_sobbing_] Mama... loved to party.
    
    _He collapses in tears on a chair.  Sue rolls her eyes._
    
        **Sue:** Excuse me again.
    
    _She returns to the kitchen._
    
        **Sue:**[_o.s._] Yeah, she loved to party all right.  With me as her 
             personal slave and handmaiden, doing all the cooking and the 
             cleaning and the wiping her sorry... [_re-entering, changing 
             her tone_] Sugar?
    **Frasier:** You know, we're a bit tired, really.  Maybe we could just turn 
             in?
     **Harbin:** Well, help me get the cushions off the fold-up.  We'll make up 
             the bed.
    
    _He and Jonathan begin to remove the cushions from the couch in that 
    room._
    
    **Frasier:** You mean we're-we're sleeping in here?
        **Sue:**[_deadpan_] Well, there's Mama's bed. [_then_] But that's in _our_ 
             room.
    **Frasier:** This'll be fine.
    
    _Charlotte nods her agreement.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    _Scene 8 - Later that night
    Frasier and Charlotte are in the hide-a-bed.  Frasier has dozed.  
    Charlotte is sitting up, staring at the casket.  Then she hears 
    an electric buzzing sound from somewhere in the house._
    
    **Charlotte:** Did you hear that?
      **Frasier:**[_waking_] What?
    
    _The buzzing again._
    
    **Charlotte:**_That!_  What do you think he's doing down there?
      **Frasier:** Well, how should I know, he's _your_ friend.
    **Charlotte:** Shh!
    _But they chuckle.  Despite everything that's happened to them that day, 
    they are still easy enough with each other to laugh about it.
    
    Footsteps are heard approaching the room.  They assume a sleeping 
    position and close their eyes.  Jonathan enters and checks that 
    they are asleep.  Then he opens the casket.  Frasier and Charlotte, 
    watching him, are both horrified and amused._
    
    **Jonathan:**[_sotto voce_] Grandma?  It's Jonathan.  I just wanted to tell 
              you that our little secret is still safe.
    _He closes the casket softly.  Frasier and Charlotte again feign sleep 
    as Jonathan checks them again, then exits.  They then sit up._
    
    **Charlotte:** Well, this tops anything that would have happened at the
               Portland Radisson.
    
    _They begin to laugh again.  Footsteps are again heard, and they re-
    assume the sleeping position.  Harbin enters, and opens the casket._
    
     **Harbin:**[_voice breaking_] Hi, Mama!  I can't believe I'm not going to 
             get one more hug. [_leans in_] What's that?  One more?  Ohhhhh...
    _He picks up the corpse and embraces it.  Frasier and Charlotte can 
    barely contain themselves, quivering in bed and desperately muffling
    their laughter.  He glances their way and they "sleep" again._
    
     **Harbin:** I better go, Mama.  I'm sorry I scraped your head with my 
             watch.
    _He closes the lid, then kisses his fingers and puts them on the coffin.
    Frasier and Charlotte exchange another look, then resume their position
    before Harbin exits.  After he is gone, they break out in unrestrained,
    but quiet laughter._
    
    **Frasier:** You know... he said the same thing to my engine when he opened 
             the hood.
    
    _Charlotte laughs.  Frasier joins her.  The mood between them is very
    playful and comfortable.  They lie facing each other._
    
      **Frasier:** Charlotte... I'm afraid we're making a terrible mistake.
    **Charlotte:** Frasier, I'm not switching sides again.
      **Frasier:** No.  I mean writing off these three weeks just 'cause you're
               moving.  I had a great time with you today, and with somebody
               else it would have been a disaster.
    **Charlotte:** With somebody else, I would have been in Portland.
      **Frasier:** Come on, you know what I'm talking about.  We have a lot of 
               Fun together.  And why deny ourselves the chance to have even 
               more?  I know the sensible thing would be to just end it now, 
               and walk away.  And normally that's what I would do, but... 
               I don't want to be sensible.
    **Charlotte:**[_with emotion_] But we'd only have three weeks.
      **Frasier:** I know.  It'd be like a summer fling.
    **Charlotte:** But wouldn't we be sad when it ended?
      **Frasier:** Of course we would.  That's what happens.  You-you're sad 
               When summer's over. [_then_] Well, I... never was.  I always 
               looked forward to the new school year, when I would buy my 
               books...
    
    _She puts a hand to his mouth._
    
    **Charlotte:**[_lovingly_] Are you going to talk all summer?
    
    _They start to kiss.  The buzzing is heard again, and they sit up, 
    smiling. 
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    _END OF ACT II_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    It is morning.  Frasier and Charlotte are asleep.  Sue enters the room 
    carrying a breakfast tray.  She sets it down and opens the casket.
    She looks at the corpse, and laughs gleefully.  Frasier and Charlotte
    wake up and watch as Sue tauntingly waves goodbye to the corpse and 
    dances with joy.  She closes the casket and brings the tray to them as 
    they "wake up."
