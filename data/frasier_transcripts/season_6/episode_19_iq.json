In a moment we see that his companion is Queen Elizabeth in full coronation regalia, who smiles raffishly and throws an empty Ballantine can off the balcony.  Martin chuckles and hands her a fresh beer, which she downs with gusto.  Daphne wakes up on the couch and checks the balcony, but there is no sign of Martin or Her Majesty.  She shakes her head and resumes dusting as we fade out.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Guest Starring** PATRICK KERR as Noel CAROLEE CARMELLO as Jody DAVID AARON BAKER as Waiter HOWARD SHANGRAW as Auctioneer PHYLLIS KATZ as Woman at auction JOSEPH LINDGREN as Dr. Zafrin   * * *  ## Synopsis {kathy churay}       Niles arrives at Frasier's apartment dressed in black tie, as is Frasier. Roz follows close behind dressed in an evening gown and carrying Alice, whom Daphne has agreed to babysit for the evening. Daphne is seated at the dining room table working at a laptop computer.  Roz is unhappy that Frasier has once again donated a \"day behind the scenes at the Frasier Crane show\" to the silent auction at the benefit they are all attending that evening, for the Kelly Ann Grunther Foundation.  Roz complains that last year she was trapped in her booth for hours with a victim of bad dental hygiene, and she doesn't want it to happen again this year.  Martin emerges from his room in his tux and asks for Daphne's help with his cufflinks.  As she leaves the dining table Niles goes over to the computer and asks what Daphne is doing.  Daphne reveals she is chatting on-line with Donny.  Just then the computer chimes and Daphne asks Niles to read her what Donny has written.  Apparently Donny is on a trip and is missing his \"wittle Engwish cwumpet.\" Daphne asks Niles to take over typing while she helps Martin, and begins dictating a treacly message about how she much loves Donny. Niles types for a moment but when her dictation gets too gooey, surreptitiously hits a button. \"Goodbye!\" chirps the computer, and the connection is lost.  Meanwhile Frasier and Roz return from putting Alice to bed.  As they don their coats Martin brags of having worked out a system to get anything he wants at the silent auction with only the minimum bid. Frasier tells him that trying to save money is hardly in the spirit of the charity auction, and Martin challenges him to tell who Kelly Ann Grunther is.  Frasier tries to cover, but really he has no idea, nor do Niles and Roz.  _FADE OUT.  SCENE TWO - The Benefit_  Frasier and Niles are checking out the auction offerings and notice that one item being auctioned off is a luncheon with three Nobel laureates. Both are intrigued, and Niles writes his bid on the pad in front of the luncheon notice.  Martin is standing guard over his auction choice, a handsome gas barbecue grill being eyed by an elegantly dressed woman.  He implements his auction strategy by speculating loudly on whether this grill isn't the one that had been recalled because of  an exploding propane tank. The woman hurries off and Martin is smugly satisfied with his maneuver.  Roz is talking with another woman who is interested in the behind-the-scenes day at the Frasier Crane Show, telling her that if she wins she will get to spend the afternoon with Roz.  As the woman makes her bid and moves away, Roz's admirer Noel Shemsky appears in a tux, eager to bid for an afternoon with Roz.  Roz tries to discourage him from writing his bid by hiding the pen, but alas, Noel wears one around his neck and happily writes down his bid.  Meanwhile Niles and Frasier are once again scoping out the bids on the laureate luncheon.  Niles is discouraged to learn that his bid has been doubled by another guest, but quickly recognizes the name as one Frasier had used as a pen name in writing for his prep school newspaper.   Frasier protests that he had merely wanted to protect Niles from starting a bidding war prompted by sibling rivalry.  Niles isn't impressed.  Roz is encouraging her first bidder to top Noel's effort.  She does so, exclaiming that she can't believe she has bid so much.  Roz tells her what a wonderful time they're going to have as Noel sneaks over and tops the woman's bid once again.  the timekeeper calls the five minute warning and Roz is desperate not to sit with Noel for an afternoon, so she pursues the woman and begs her to raise her bid. The woman does so, saying that she had thought she sensed \"a spark\" between her and Roz.  She invites Roz to dinner after their afternoon at the station, and Roz weighs the sticky romantic situation against spending an afternoon with the love-struck Noel.  It takes only a moment for Roz to decide.  \"Do you like Italian?\" Roz asks bravely as the woman obligingly raises her bid.  Niles and Frasier are engaged in a poker-like duel of bid and counter-bid, until finally Niles tops Frasier's bid by $50 as the whistle blows to end the auction.  The auctioneer jubilantly announces the winning for the Nobel laureate luncheon -- $4,050 bid by Niles Crane. Niles is aghast at the money he has spent.  The crowd applauds and the auctioneer is so impressed that he proposes an exception to the usual rule, allowing an additional place setting at the luncheon for Frasier if he will match his brother's bid. Embarrassed into it, Frasier reluctantly agrees, muttering to Niles that at least the money goes to charity.  Martin shakes his head as the auctioneer proclaims that thanks to the brothers Crane, there will be a lot fewer homeless cats on the streets of Seattle for the coming year.  _FADE OUT.  ACT TWO_  ****Frasier and Niles Discover Whose Is Bigger****   The Crane men arrive home after the auction as Daphne inquires how it went.  Martin crows over acquiring the new grill, the \"Windsor-monic 2000\" and wonders aloud whether that's the one the British royal family uses.  Daphne observes sourly that that was surely the inspiration for the newest English postage stamp -- QEII with barbecue tongs and a sauce brush.   As she heads toward her room she remarks that Roz has already been to the apartment to collect Alice, taking the highway to avoid Noel on his Moped.  As the brothers sit down for a post-auction brandy Niles begins to speculate about the origins of the sibling rivalry that led him and Frasier to spend so much money that evening.  Frasier replies that it must have begun with competition for their mother's attention, and each of them recounts examples of why Mom loved the other brother best.  At last they conclude that neither one of them had been the favorite, and their whole lifelong history of competition has been pointless.  Frasier reminds Niles about the IQ tests they had taken as children. Their mother had refused to tell them anything except that they were only two points apart.  Niles confesses that he thought Frasier's score was higher, and Frasier agrees he thought the same about Niles. But they keep picking at the issue, and eventually rationalize that it would be a real sign of growth on their parts to find out the IQ scores now and avoid getting into a rivalry over them.  At this point Martin returns to the living room in more comfortable clothes and the brothers inquire about the IQ scores.  Martin doesn't remember them, but tells them he keeps an old Ballantyne case up in his closet with all the boys' childhood mementos.  They rush off to retrieve the box as Daphne returns, marveling at how much money the brothers spent at the auction.   Martin tells her they were always competitive.  This prompts Daphne to launch into a rather gruesome story about her brothers' competitiveness that involved her brothers \"bowling\" the youngest brother Michael across a frozen lake in a burlap sack.  Niles and Frasier return with the Ballantyne box and have fun rummaging through the ribbons and certificates and art of their childhood until Niles finds the IQ scores.  He congratulates Frasier on his near-genius score -- 129.  Frasier congratulates him on his \"two points higher\" score of 131, but Niles can't repress a smug grin.  Their mother's two-point fiction was a cover for Niles's much higher score of 156.  Frasier tries hard to be pleased for Niles, and Niles compliments him on his maturity, but it's clear the fun has gone out of the evening and Frasier calls it a night.  The moment Niles is out the door Frasier snaps at Daphne, \"How late is that university library open?\"  He heads to the kitchen to fill a thermos with coffee to keep himself awake during the night as he studies for his upcoming lunch with \"the four geniuses.\"  _FADE OUT.  SCENE TWO - Fiddlesticks Restaurant - The Next Afternoon_  Niles is already seated at the table as a bleary but prepared Frasier arrives.  Niles quickly tells Frasier he knows his brother spent the night at the university library. Frasier counters with the observation that Niles is sneezing and scratching his ear, and the only possible cause is that Niles's parchment mite allergy was aggravated by spending the night in the stacks at that very same library.  As Niles blusters about not letting his brother get the upper hand at the luncheon, he takes another dose of the same allergy pills he's already taken for the sneezing, and soon his speech begins to wander and he makes less and less sense.  Frasier eye begins to twitch from the effects of all the caffeine he has consumed, and Niles leans nonchanalantly on the butter dish as he accuses his brother of hallucinations.   Things deteriorate rapidly and Niles ends up with his head on the table as the Nobel laureates show up.  Frasier has accidentally tucked the end of the tablecloth into his belt along with his napkin, and as he rises to greet the guests he pulls the entire tablecloth and his brother onto the floor.  _FADE OUT.  SCENE THREE - Frasier's Kitchen - Later That Afternoon_  Frasier is making hamburger patties for Martin's barbecue grill as Niles wanders into the kitchen still dazed with sleep.   Niles doesn't remember the end of the luncheon, and Frasier reminds him that Niles knocked over the restaurant's aquarium on the way out, causing an additional $1,000 worth of damage and humiliating himself as he attempted to revive the litlle plastic diver from the fish tank.   Niles is depressed over the results of their rivalry until they begin to talk about all the good that's come from it -- their academic successes, their thriving careers, always spurred on by fear of being bested by the other brother.  They are congratulating themselves on getting over the need for a parent's approval when Martin enters the kitchen looking for the hamburger patties. He remarks that the ones they've made are just perfect, and the two brothers glow at this evidence of their father's approval.  ",
