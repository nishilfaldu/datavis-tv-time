As soon as she hangs up, she goes radge on the steak, pounding the stuffing out of it.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Special Guest Stars** CHRISTINE BARANSKI as Dr. Nora PIPER LAURIE as Mrs. Mulhern  **Guest Starring** TOM McGOWAN as Kenny DOUGLAS OWEN McDONALD as George  **Guest Callers** GILLIAN ANDERSON as Jenny YO-YO MA as Tom BONNIE RAITT as Denise PIA ZADORA as Jill   * * *  ## Synopsis {kathy churay}     _ACT ONE  Scene One - Cafe Nervosa_  Frasier is seated at a table and a man is just leaving as Niles comes over to Frasier's table with his coffee.  Niles is amazed to notice that the man is Dr. Gordon Edelstein, whom Niles admires for his authorship of a book about obsessive-compulsive disorders.  Frasier tells Niles that he is interviewing therapists for an available radio slot at KACL -- the station is hiring another call-in psychiatrist for a one-week trial period, and Frasier has been asked to choose among the finalists.  Niles sits down, but Frasier warns him he has another interviewee coming in a few minutes.   Niles marvels at Frasier's positive attitude about something that could be perceived as a threat to his position, but Frasier is flattered that the station wants even more of what he has to offer.  Niles asks Frasier for his opinion on his \"raffish new look.\"  He says he is taking Frasier's advice to accept Daphne's relationship with Donny and find himself a girlfriend, so he has taken the first step.  Frasier pretends at first but finally admits he can't identify what's different about Niles, till Niles informs him that he is growing a (quite invisible) mustache.  Dr. Nora Fairchild comes into the cafe and introduces herself to Frasier, bowling him over with compliment after compliment.  He introduces her to Niles, whom she says must be very proud of his \"kid brother,\" the radio star.  Niles, ever sure of Frasier's vanity, congratulates Dr. Nora on her new job at KACL as he takes his leave.    Dr. Nora reports for her first day at KACL, escorted by Kenny the station manager and her good-looking producer, George.  Frasier gives her a warm welcome and Roz is quite taken with George.  She pulls him by the hand into her control booth, offering to \"give him the lay of the land.\" Frasier wishes Nora luck and exits to the hall, where he meets Roz.  They watch Dr. Nora setting up for her show and Frasier is rhapsodizing about how thrilling it is to have a protege.  Roz is predictably nauseated by Frasier's ego.  Dr. Nora is polished and professional as she listens to her first caller, Jenny, who is having trouble with her live-in boyfriend. Frasier and Roz drift off down the hall as Frasier realizes Nora has the situation well in hand.  They come running back, however, as Nora neatly summarizes Jenny's trouble:  Jenny is a whore because she has sex with her boyfriend without being married.  Frasier and Roz watch and listen in astonishment from outside the booth as Nora advises Jenny to staple her knees together until she and her boyfriend are married.  An amazed crowd of station workers begins to gather outside the booth as Roz dryly notes to Frasier that Dr. Nora seems to have gotten over her nervousness quite nicely.    Daphne is drying dishes as Niles tries to get her to notice his mustache. Daphne thinks he's fishing for compliments about his suit, then tries to wipe away what she thinks is food on his upper lip.  He informs her it's a mustache, and she says it reminds her of her Grammy Moon -- or will, once it's grown in.  Frasier arrives home and demands that Daphne turn on KACL i immediately.  She does, and Dr. Nora is abusing a woman who wants a divorce from her husband because he's gay.  Frasier turns the radio off in disgust.  Niles remarks on Nora's harshness, but Martin feels her old-fashioned view of morality is refreshing.  Daphne and Martin had been listening to Dr. Nora while doing his exercises.  Daphne agrees with Martin -- Nora reminds Daphne of her mother, and Daphne goes off to call Mum.  Frasier is still complaining about Dr. Nora.  He plans to have a word with her at the station the next day -- tell her to soften her approach before she alienates her audience.  After all, he says, people know the difference between constructive criticism and outright abuse.  And Daphne comes walking through with the portable phone on her way to the kitchen, laughing gaily at her mother, who wants to know whether Daphne's boyfriend hasn't found someone prettier and smarter yet.   _ACT TWO  Scene One - The Radio Studio_  Frasier is wrapping up his show as Dr. Nora arrives.  He greets her frostily and is about to deliver some diplomatic criticism when Roz weighs in with the blunt, name-calling approach, defending the honor of a single mother who called the day before only to be abused by Dr. Nora.   Dr. Nora retorts that she would expect Roz to defend the woman, the way Roz pounced on Nora's producer the day before. Frasier has to physically restrain Roz, who wants to fight Nora and offers to \"take it out on the street.\"  When Nora tells Roz the street is Roz's home territory, it's all Frasier can do to keep Roz from killing her.  He pushes Roz out of the booth and turns on Nora.  He begins taking Nora to task for her unhelpful, moralistic criticisms of her callers, but Nora will have none of it.  She defies Frasier to admit that he hired her because he hoped to sleep with her.  He hotly denies it and tells her that she is at KACL on his recommendation, which he is now withdrawing.  Just then Kenny enters with the news that Dr. Nora's show is a hit.  Some people love her and some her, but everyone seems to be listening.  Frasier follows Kenny out to the hall to plead his case, but as Kenny says, \"Ratings are ratings.\"  Meanwhile Nora's caller Tom is asking what he can do about a co-worker who's driving him crazy.  Smirking at Frasier through the glass, Nora replies, \"Not one damn thing.\"    Frasier and Roz listen sympathetically his caller Denise recounts her troubles with her verbally abusive mother, as Dr. Nora watches through the window.  Frasier advises Denise to seek counseling, telling her to stay on the line so that Roz can give her the numbers of some therapists. Frasier ends the show and goes in to talk with Roz as Dr. Nora sits down at her console.  Abruptly, Nora gets Denise back on the line [_and on the air_], telling her to ignore everything Frasier has told her.  Nora tells Denise wrenchingly that in her personal experience the only thing to do with an abusive mother is to cut her out of your life like a tumor. And she disconnects Denise.  George connects Nora's next caller -- who is Frasier, calling from the control booth.   He takes her to task on the air for her unprofessional behavior, but Nora disconnects him and goes back to Chopper Dave for the traffic report.  Frasier hangs up and storms into the booth to have it out with Nora.  He tells her tersely that they must agree not to criticize one another on the air, but Nora won't agree.  She won't \"enable\" callers who are behaving immorally because they don't need better self-esteem.  Their problem is that they are going to Hell for their behavior!  Frasier storms out, vowing to make war on Dr. Nora.  Roz hangs back trying to sweet-talk George, but when he tells her he believes in Dr. Nora's no-sex stance, Roz agrees -- it's war!    Niles arrives, declaring to Martin that he has shaved his mustache and has decided to change his look by pumping iron.  Martin is approving, if puzzled by the reported disappearance of a mustache he'd never noticed in the first place.   Daphne comes in from the laundry room followed by Roz, whom she's met in the hall.  Roz can't wait to tell Frasier about the dirt she dug up on Dr. Nora from her former colleagues at another station.  Apparently Dr. Nora's degree is in physical education, not psychology, and she's had two divorces and an affair with a married man.  Frasier is elated.  Martin tells a story about a feud he had with another officer on the force, and cautions him against ending up looking like an idiot. Frasier realizes he is right and as a psychiatrist he should have a better method of resolving conflict.  Roz is infuriated at Frasier for wimping out on her, but Niles encourages Frasier to begin by analyzing Dr. Nora's obviously troubled relationship with her estranged mother.  They speculate on whether Nora's mother is still alive, prompting Daphne to begin fantasizing happily and at length about the many awful ways a woman of that age could have died. Frasier and Niles are fascinated at what's she's revealing about herself as Daphne finishes folding the laundry and goes merrily off to her room.    Dr. Nora is at it again, marveling to her audience about the unsuitably of giving a baby shower for an unwed mother.  Meanwhile, Roz is frothing at the mouth in the hallway as Frasier arrives, asking whether Nora's mother is has made it to the studio.  They go out to the lobby to greet Nora's mother, Mrs. Mulherne [_Piper Laurie_], who tells them that the reason she and Nora were estranged was her disapproval of the man Nora wanted to marry.  Frasier is touched and vows she will have the chance to tell Nora how much she loves her.  Frasier returns to the control room and dials Dr. Nora again, forcing George to put him on the air.  Nora asks cynically whether Frasier wants to yell at her, but Frasier tells her that there is someone who's wanted to say something to Nora for a very long time.  Mrs. Mulherne enters the studio and delivers her message to Nora -- \"You little whore!\"  And she's off on a diatribe about Nora's cheapness in refusing to give her enough cash for even a cheap bottle of wine.  Frasier is aghast as Mrs. Mulherne locks everyone else out of the studio and Roz is overcome with joy as Dr. Nora is reduced to tears by her mother's abuse and demands for money from Nora.  Nora escapes to the control booth and locks her mother into the studio.  She turns on Frasier and tells him she can't believe his cruelty.  Frasier is guilt-stricken -- \"She seemed delightful on the phone!\"  Nora flees screaming into the hallway, pursued by a ranting Mrs. Mulherne, as Frasier frantically takes over the mike for the remainder of Nora's show.
