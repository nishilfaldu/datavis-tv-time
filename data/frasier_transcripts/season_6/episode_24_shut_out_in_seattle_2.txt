    _ACT THREE
    
    Scene One - The Radio Station
    Frasier is on the phone as Roz comes in with a clipboard._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, pick up, will you?  It's Frasier. [_beat_] All right, 
             fine.  Call me later. [_hanging up, to Roz_] I don't even know 
             why I bother anymore.  He doesn't pick up phones these days, 
             just waitresses.
        **Roz:** Give him a break, he's just having fun.
    **Frasier:** That's exactly what I'd expect to hear from someone who's
             willing to spend the night as Bulldog's squeak toy.
        **Roz:** That is not funny!  It was one night, and I would appreciate
             it if you would just let it drop.  
    **Frasier:** You're right, I'm sorry, that was tactless of me.  Tell you 
             what, let me make it up to you.  I've got an extra theater 
             ticket tonight.  Faye's busy, why don't you join me?
        **Roz:** No, thanks.  
    **Frasier:** No, please, Roz.  It's a delightful little show.  I'll even 
             throw in dinner.
        **Roz:** Busy.
    **Frasier:** Really.  A date?
        **Roz:**[_exploding_] I have plans!  Plans!  What are you, a cop?! 
             I've got to account for every waking minute?!  My private
             life is my own business!
    **Frasier:**[_realizing_] Bulldog!
        **Roz:**[_bursting into tears_] I don't know what's wrong with me! 
             I'm weak.  I can't stop myself!
    **Frasier:** Yes you can, Roz.
        **Roz:** Okay, I don't want to stop myself.  He's good.  He's really 
             good.  I mean, I'm better, but he's trainable.
    **Frasier:** Roz, it's Bulldog!  Doesn't that bother you?
        **Roz:** You'd think.  
    
    _Bulldog comes in nonchalantly.  Roz pretends nothing's going on._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, Doc.
    **Frasier:** Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, Roz, you still going to help me, uh, write those... promos 
             for my show tonight?  Around 10:00?
        **Roz:** It's okay, Bulldog, he knows.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  But high marks on that cryptic cover story.
    **Bulldog:**[_drums his fists on Frasier's chest, then_] I've gotta make 
             a call.  Station manager's been calling me all day. [_to Roz_] 
             Oh, I made us a reservation.  Thought maybe we could get a 
             little dinner first.
        **Roz:** You mean... eat together?
    **Bulldog:** Yeah.  I'll be right back.  
    
    _He kisses her and exits to the control booth.  Roz is stunned._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's beautiful, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh God, this ruins everything!
    **Frasier:** What?
        **Roz:** Well, didn't you hear what he said?  He wants to buy me 
             dinner.  Do you realize what this means?
    **Frasier:** They finally opened that new Hooters out by the airport?
        **Roz:** No.  He's crossed the line.  He actually thinks we're dating!
    **Frasier:** Roz, didn't your mother warn you that sex could lead to things 
             like dating?
        **Roz:**[_shaken_] Look, that is it.  I'm going to put an end to this
             before it goes too far.
    _Bulldog comes back into the studio, a bemused expression on his face._ 
    **Bulldog:** I don't believe it. They just fired me.
    _Frasier and Roz are shocked.  Bulldog tries to brazen it out, 
    but he's very upset._
    
    **Frasier:** What?
    **Bulldog:** Yeah.  They said my ratings are low, the show's losing 
             its edge, I'm getting soft.  My last day's Friday.
    **Frasier:**[_concerned_] Oh, Bulldog, I'm so sorry.  Are you all right?
    **Bulldog:** No, I'm not. [_slamming the counter weakly_] This stinks.
             This is total B.S. [_breaking into tears_] You don't think
             I'm getting soft, do you?
    **Frasier:** No, no, not at all. [_handing him a tissue_] Here.
    **Bulldog:**[_blowing his nose_] I just thank God I got a girlfriend 
             like you, Roz.  I don't think I can face this alone.
    _He walks over to her and hangs his head, expecting to be comforted.  
    Roz shoots Frasier a panicked look, but Frasier nods at her to comfort 
    him.  Bulldog forces the issue by enfolding her in a big hug, which she 
    barely tolerates._  
    
        **Roz:**[_lightly patting his back_] There, there.
    _Frasier grabs Roz's hands and places them around Bulldog's back in a 
    comforting hug as he slips out the door.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **MOON AROUND THE RING**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment - Morning
    Frasier enters in his dressing gown with his hands behind his back
    as Martin reads the paper at the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne!  Morning, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey.
    
    _Daphne comes in from the kitchen, her left hand buried in a bag of 
    cheese doodles._
    
     **Daphne:** Yes?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, please.  Donny's not here.  Will you just take 
             your hand out of the bag?  
    
    _She does, looking sheepish._
    
    **Frasier:** I was just undressing to take my bath, when I sat on the edge
             of the tub and landed... [_holds up her ring_] on this.
     **Daphne:** Oh my God, you found my ring! [_hugging him_] I'd given up, 
             I thought it was someplace I'd never find it!
    **Frasier:** It very nearly was. [_Martin guffaws_]
     **Daphne:** Come on, let me have it.
    **Frasier:**[_indicating her messy hand_] No, no, no, you go rinse off 
             this doodle dust first.
     **Daphne:** Oh, right, yes.
    
    _She runs into the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** Well, you sure saved Daphne there.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and I also did myself a little favor as well.  Can you 
             imagine what conclusions Faye might have jumped to had she 
             found this engagement ring in my room?
    
    _Faye comes in from the bedroom and overhears him._
    
       **Faye:** Oh, Frasier, for me?  I had no idea!  
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, uh...
       **Faye:**[_grabbing the ring_] It's beautiful!  It's so beautiful!  
             Yes, Frasier, I do!  I do!  
    _She gives him a big kiss.  He gropes for words to explain.  She looks 
    at him knowingly._
    
       **Faye:** Oh, calm down, you big dope.  I know it's Daphne's ring.  
    
    _She hits him playfully as Martin laughs._
    
       **Faye:** And, uh, I can't tell you how flattered I am by those beads of 
             sweat on your forehead.
    
    _She goes into the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:**[_calling after her_] Well, they're love beads, honey! 
             [_to Martin_] Oh God, will you take this thing?
     **Martin:**[_taking the ring_] Well, I don't want it!  What if Bonnie 
             sees me with it?
    
    _Bonnie comes in from the bedroom._
    
     **Bonnie:** Sees you with what?  
     **Martin:**[_flustered_] Daphne, will you come in here and take this damn 
             ring, please?
     **Daphne:**[_o.s._] Coming!
     **Martin:**[_seating Bonnie_] Sit down and have a little coffee.
    
    _Daphne and Faye return from the kitchen as Donny emerges from 
    Daphne's room in robe and slippers._
    
      **Donny:** Good morning, everybody!  Another full house, I see.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and that robe is available for purchase in the gift shop.
      **Donny:** Hi. [_kissing Daphne and noticing her hand_] Oh, you found
             your ring!
     **Daphne:** What?  You knew it was gone?
      **Donny:** Well, Daphne, when your fiancee gives you a hug with a chicken 
             on her hand, then bells go off.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry-
      **Donny:** Oh, that's okay, honey. [_kisses her_] You know, I didn't want 
             to say anything because I knew it would turn up sooner or 
             later, and I didn't want to make you feel worse.
    **Frasier:** As long as we're tying up loose ends here, I was just 
             wondering, what was your ring doing on the edge of my
             Jacuzzi tub, right next to my favorite scented candle -- 
             which was burned down to the wick?
     **Daphne:** I'm going to let my attorney handle this one.
    
    _She exits to her bedroom as Frasier nods wryly._
    
      **Donny:** I'm sorry, Frasier.  I guess after a little champagne we got 
             into the mood, and into the nude, and into the tub.  But don't 
             worry, we'll replace the candle.
    **Frasier:** If only you could replace the image.  Next time, if you don't 
             mind, will you just turn down the temperature a little?
      **Donny:** Actually, we tried, but the knob was stuck.
     **Bonnie:** Yeah, it does that.  You gotta jiggle it a little.
    _Frasier is shocked that Bonnie and Martin have been using his tub too.  
    The doorbell rings and Martin gets up to answer it._
    
     **Martin:** Don't worry, it's not what you think!  We use it to give Eddie 
             a bath.
    _This doesn't make Frasier feel any better.  Donny exits to Daphne's 
    bedroom.  
    
    Martin opens the door to find Kit with Niles.  They are dressed in
    matching black leather jackets for club-hopping, Niles wearing a 
    black t-shirt and pegged pants and looking bleary-eyed but happy - 
    and VERY relaxed.  Frasier is exasperated at Niles's attempt to 
    recapture his youth._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, guys!
        **Kit:** Good morning!
    **Frasier:** Well, you're up early.
      **Niles:** You mean still up.  We never went to bed.
        **Kit:** We'll get there!
    
    _Niles gloats as Kit grabs at him lustily._
    
     **Martin:** What did you do all night?
      **Niles:** Oh, what didn't we do?  We started off at a concert, wonderful 
             group called Uncle Dirtnap.  Then we danced the night away at 
             every club in the U district before finding ourselves at an 
             after-party at Kit's friend Massimo's place.  He's a squatter.  
             Anyway, I wanted to give Kit the keys to my building and I 
             remembered I have a spare set here, so I thought we'd pop by.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well then, let me get them for you.  I can offer you
             a pastry, courtesy of Le Cigare Volant. 
    
    _Faye holds out a plate of pastries._
    
        **Kit:** Oh, no thanks.  You know, those things are loaded with 
             bleached flour.  That stuff's poison.
    _She takes out a cigarette, which Niles lights without batting an eye. 
    Faye registers this insult to her pastry-making._
    
        **Kit:** Oh, Niles, give me your cell phone.  I'll call the travel 
             agent.
     **Martin:** You going on a trip?
        **Kit:** Yeah, he's taking me to France for the weekend.  Euro-Disney!
      **Niles:** Massimo said we just had to go.  Apparently it is so lame,
             it's cool.
    _Kit walks out to the balcony with the cell phone and her cigarette._
    
       **Faye:**[_getting her coat_] Well, I should get going.  Places to go,
             people to poison.
     **Bonnie:** I should get going too. [_to Martin_] I'll pick up Lady and meet 
             you and Eddie at the park at 10:30?
     **Martin:** Better make it 11:00.  
    
    _Faye and Bonnie leave._
    
      **Niles:**[_whispering so Kit doesn't hear_] Frasier, isn't she great?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  
      **Niles:** She's so free, so spontaneous.  She has breathed new life
             into me.
    _They both watch as Kit is doubled over with smoker's cough out on the
    balcony._
    
    **Frasier:** You may have to return the favor.
      **Niles:**[_as they sit down at the table_] Am I detecting disapproval?
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, not at all, just... Well, all right.  Don't you 
             think you two are going just a bit quickly?
      **Niles:** Oh, for the past year you have told me I had to get over 
             Daphne, find someone else.  Now I do and all you can do is 
             find fault.  Man, you are such a buzz kill.
    **Frasier:** Will you stop talking like that?  I'm just a little concerned, 
             Niles.  You met this girl last week, she's spent every night 
             with you, now you're giving her the keys to your apartment?
      **Niles:** I think you're just jealous.
    **Frasier:** Jealous?  
      **Niles:** Yes.  Here I have attracted this untamed, free spirit, and
             you're saddled with an uptight pastry chef whose name you
             can't even remember.
    **Frasier:** Her name is Faye!  And I am not jealous, I'm just a little 
             worried about you.  I'm afraid you might get hurt.
      **Niles:** Oh.  Here we go.  Whatever would I do, without my wise older
             brother to tell me what to do?
    **Frasier:** Well, frankly, you couldn't be acting more like a child. 
             You think I don't know the real reason you came over here?
             It wasn't to get your keys, it was to show off Lolita's kid
             sister out there.  The two of you have absolutely nothing in
             common.
    
    _Niles picks up Kit's purse as she comes in from the balcony._
    
        **Kit:** Well, we're all set for Euro-Disney!
      **Niles:** Great.  You ready to go home?
        **Kit:** Oh, sure.  Bye, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Bye.
        **Kit:** Oh, I'm so excited for this trip!  I'm going to spend all my
             time at Fantasy Land.
    
    _They head out the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles? [_Niles turns back to listen_] I'm sorry, I take it 
             back.  You do have something in common.
    _FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT THREE
    
    ACT FOUR_
    **SOONER OR LATER EVERYONE 
    COMES TO CAFE NERVOSA**
    
    _Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa - Morning
    In the back of the cafe, Kit jumps into Niles's lap and kisses him as 
    he tries to read the newspaper.  He looks pleased.  Frasier and Roz 
    look on cynically as Frasier sits down at her table._
    
    **Frasier:** Isn't that a darling sight?  Time was when a waitress said, 
             "Can I warm that up for you?" she was talking about your 
             coffee.  How was your date with Bulldog last night?
        **Roz:** Hideous.  He took me to a nice restaurant, he brought me 
             flowers, and then we went back to his place and cuddled.
             All I could think of the whole time was, "How do I dump 
             this loser?"
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz...  
        **Roz:** He's meeting me here for coffee and I'm ending this thing
             once and for all.
    **Frasier:**[_looking back at Kit and Niles kissing affectionately_] Yeah, 
             well, good luck getting a cup of coffee.  You know, it's the 
             funniest thing.  He really does look happy, doesn't he?
        **Roz:** Yeah, so just leave it alone.
    **Frasier:** Maybe you're right. [_dialing his cell phone_] Do you realize 
             that this is the first time in recent history that all three 
             Crane men have been in happy relationships?  Maybe I should 
             be celebrating that fact rather than being such a buzz kill.
        **Roz:** What does that mean?
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, plug in. [_on the phone, leaving a message_] Hi, honey, 
             it's Frasier.  Listen, I just read a marvelous review of this 
             charming boite out in Freemont and I thought to myself, "that 
             is a place that Cassandra would just love," so-
        **Roz:**[_whispering urgently_] Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_aside to Roz_] Not now, Roz, please.
        **Roz:** You just called her Cassandra!
    **Frasier:**[_realizing she's right_] Oh, dear God, I'm- [_on the phone_] 
             My producer Roz informs me that I just called you Cassandra.  
             I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep doing this.  I know that 
             you're Faye.  Fabulous Faye!  Forever Faye!  Call me, Faye. 
             [_hanging up, to Roz_] It is one syllable!  What the hell is 
             wrong with me?  
    
    _Roz starts laughing._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad to see that you think it's funny.
        **Roz:** No, I don't, I just... I'm having a flashback to my summer
             of Ted, Todd, and Tad.  
    _Bulldog enters the caf e and comes over to their table, handing Roz a 
    cute stuffed dog which she accepts reluctantly.  Frasier gets up to 
    move._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, sports fans!
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh, Bulldog, hi.  You know what?  You may have my seat.  
             I'm going to sit over there. [_He leaves._]
    **Bulldog:** All right. [_sitting down with Roz_] Hey, gorgeous.  
        **Roz:** Look, Bulldog, you and I need to talk about what's been 
             going on between us.
    **Bulldog:** I know.  
    
    _He takes her hand.  She jerks it away._
    
        **Roz:**[_hissing_] We're in public!
    **Bulldog:** Look. [_hand on his heart_] I want to tell you what's going on 
             in here, okay? 
        **Roz:** Bulldog, I don't want to know--
    **Bulldog:** Roz, I've gotta be honest with you.  This past week has 
             been amazing, but... I met a total babe at unemployment 
             this morning and we're going to Hawaii this afternoon.  
        **Roz:** What?!
    **Bulldog:** I know, I know.  Getting dumped - ouch.  It hurts like hell.
        **Roz:** No, I don't believe this!  I came here to dump you!
    **Bulldog:** Hey, whatever you gotta say to get through this, it's okay 
             with me.
        **Roz:** But-
    **Bulldog:** I know, I know.  I didn't mean to make you fall in love with 
             me.
        **Roz:**[_inarticulate with rage_] I didn't!  You repulse me!
    **Bulldog:**[_loudly, rising to leave_] Hey, love hurts, Roz.  And I'm not  
             talking about the time we fell off the kitchen table.  Aloha, 
             old friend.
        **Roz:**[_grabbing the stuffed dog to attack him_] Bulldog, you cuddle 
             lousy and I'm glad you got fired! 
    _Bulldog exits as Roz throws the dog after him.  Frasier looks on,
    bemused, and another caf e patron lowers his newspaper to get a 
    closer view.  It's Noel, looking sly._
    
       **Noel:**[_to Roz_] Well, timing is everything.
        **Roz:** Back off, buzz kill!
    
    _She flees to the bathroom.  Noel looks after her, then raises his 
    paper again as Martin comes in and spots Frasier sitting alone._
    
     **Martin:** Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hey, Dad.
     **Martin:**[_at the counter_] Black coffee to go, please.
    
    _Martin sits down with Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** You okay?
     **Martin:** I just broke it off with Bonnie.
    **Frasier:** Oh, gee.  I'm so sorry.  What happened?
     **Martin:** Lady humped Eddie.
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?
     **Martin:** You heard me.  It was humiliating.
    **Frasier:** But Eddie's a boy dog and Lady's a... well, a lady.
     **Martin:** Yes, well, that would be the humiliating part, now wouldn't 
             it?  Right in his own park in front of all those other dogs. 
             [_Frasier starts smiling_] Yeah, Bonnie got a big kick out of 
             it, too. 
    **Frasier:** Sorry.
     **Martin:** I told her off and that was it.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckling_] I'm sorry, Dad.
     **Martin:** It's not funny.
    **Frasier:** I know, I know, I know. [_trying to be serious, then_]
             Was he wearing a hat? [_laughs_]
    
    _Martin gets up disgustedly to leave as Faye comes in._
    
    **Frasier:** No, Dad, please, come back...
       **Faye:** Hi, Martin.
     **Martin:**[_leaving_] Hey, Faye.
    **Frasier:** Hi, honey.
       **Faye:**[_kissing him_] Hi.  I was near the station so I just thought
             I'd see if you were around.
    **Frasier:** Oh, great. [_to Roz, returning to her table_] Oh, Roz,
             you remember... Faye!
        **Roz:** Hi, Faye.
       **Faye:** You were going to say Cassandra, weren't you?
    **Frasier:** No, no.  Why would you think such a thing?
       **Faye:** Well, for one, I just checked my messages.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm so sorry.  I don't know why it keeps happening. 
             You just have this remarkable resemblance to-
       **Faye:** I know, I know.  Your aunt. [_going to the ladies' room_] 
             I'll be right back.
    **Frasier:**[_to Roz_] I have got to stop saying Cassandra!
    
    _Cassandra comes into the cafe and spots them._
    
    **Cassandra:** Frasier!
      **Frasier:** Cassandra!  
          **Roz:** Hi, Cassandra.
      **Frasier:** So, how've you been?
    **Cassandra:** Great.  Actually I've been wanting to talk to you for a
               while.  We've been sort of... avoiding each other at work
               and it just all seems so silly.  I mean, I really don't
               have any hard feelings about the way things ended between
               us.
      **Frasier:** Oh, well, that's wonderful.  Neither do I.
    **Cassandra:** You dumped me.  You're not allowed to have hard
               feelings.  Anyway, my life is great.  I'm back together
               with Sloan.  You know, you and I should have coffee
               together sometime.
    
    _Faye returns from the bathroom.  Cassandra doesn't see her, and 
    neither does Frasier at first._ 
    
      **Frasier:** That'd be nice, yes.
    **Cassandra:** I'm just glad we're putting all this awkwardness behind
               us.
      **Frasier:** Me, too.
    
    _She moves to hug him, and he is willing until he spots Faye 
    approaching.  Then he twists Cassandra's arm and turns it into a 
    painful handshake that doesn't fool Faye._
    
    **Cassandra:** Ouch!
         **Faye:**[_to Cassandra_] Hello.
    **Cassandra:** Hello.
      **Frasier:**[_sweating_] Well...
          **Roz:**[_jumping in_] Whoa!  I've gotta get back to work. 
               [_to Cassandra_] Going back to the station?
    **Cassandra:** Uh, yes...
          **Roz:**[_pushing her out the door_] Good, I'll walk with you.
               Oh my God, look at the time.  We've got to hurry.  Bye,
               Faye.  Bye Frasier.
      **Frasier:** Bye-bye.  Love you.
          **Roz:**[_leaving_] Yes, you do!
         **Faye:** Who was that?
      **Frasier:** You know Roz.
         **Faye:** No, the other one.
      **Frasier:** Oh, she's the, um, promotions director.
         **Faye:** Well, she's gorgeous.  Don't you think so?
      **Frasier:** I don't know, I never really looked.
         **Faye:** Well, don't start looking now. [_kissing him, then exiting_] 
               If I'm going to stay I should feed the meter.
      **Frasier:** Lucky meter.
    _He savors his narrow escape as Niles comes over to the table and sits
    down.  He's once again wearing his usual elegant suit._
    
      **Niles:** Hey there, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, hi.  Listen, Niles, I want to apologize for getting 
             upset this morning.  I've been giving it some thought and I 
             think maybe Kit is just what the doctor ordered.
      **Niles:**[_gloating_] Is she ever!
    **Frasier:** And no strings?  Just fun, right?  That's what she says.
      **Niles:** Exactly.  So, you really like her?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I do.
      **Niles:** And you're not just saying that?
    **Frasier:** Absolutely not.
      **Niles:** You want her?
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?
      **Niles:** Frasier, she's killing me.  I'm just not cut out for this
             lifestyle.  Between seeing myself in a mirror at the club
             dancing my modified Charleston, and then catching my
             reflection in the store window this morning as I Rollerbladed 
             past in spandex, I feel like I'm being stalked by some pathetic 
             middle-aged ghoul.  Obviously, I've got to break it off with 
             her.
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh.  I'm so sorry, Niles.  You going to tell her now?
      **Niles:** No, I'll arrange to meet her after work.  To tell you the 
             truth, I think she's losing interest herself.  I couldn't 
             help noticing a little eye-rolling today when my skate wheel 
             got stuck in a storm grate. [_gets up_] And... thanks for not 
             saying "I told you so."
    _He walks over to the counter where Kit is picking up a tray of coffees._
    
      **Niles:** Hey, Kit, there's something I wanted to talk to you about
             later.
        **Kit:** Just talk to me now.  You know you can tell me anything.
      **Niles:** No, I'd rather do it after your shift.  
        **Kit:** You have such a serious face. [_jokingly_] What, are we
             breaking up or something?
      **Niles:** Well...
    _Kit drops her tray in shock, shattering coffee cups and thus drawing 
    the attention of the whole caf e.
    _
        **Kit:** Oh my God!  You just dumped me?  Right here where I work in 
             front of everyone I wait on?
      **Niles:** That's okay, we'll go outside.
        **Kit:**[_yelling hysterically_] Give me an answer!
      **Niles:**[_appalled_] Kit, Kit, calm down-
        **Kit:** You're tired of me?  Is that what it is?
      **Niles:** It's all right-
        **Kit:** You've had enough of me?  I gave you everything and you used
             me!  Sex, sex, sex!  The way you come to bed every night -
             wanting it, begging for it!
      **Niles:** I never had to beg!
        **Kit:** I'm just a whore to you, aren't I?  
      **Niles:**[_shocked_] No, don't say that!
        **Kit:** That's all I am, your whore!  Your whore from the cafe!
    _She runs out of the cafe as Niles stands stunned amid the broken 
    crockery.  The other patrons stare at him in dead silence as he 
    attempts to explain._
    
      **Niles:** It's really more of a compatibility thing.  I'm recently
             divorced and I've been under a lot of strain...
    
    _Frasier goes over to rescue him._
    
      **Niles:** It's been very painful for everyone...
    **Frasier:** Niles, they're strangers.  It's all right, Niles.  Let's just
             pick this up, shall we?
    
    _They gather the broken china as Faye comes back into the caf e._
    
       **Faye:** What happened?
    **Frasier:** I'm not really sure, actually.  Just give me a minute, will
             you?
    
    _Cassandra comes in and approaches Faye._
    
    **Cassandra:** Excuse me, is Frasier still here?  I just had something
               I needed to ask him.
         **Faye:** Oh, yeah, he's over there.  I didn't get a chance to meet 
               you before.  I'm Faye. [_holds out her hand_]
    **Cassandra:**[_takes it_] Oh, how do you do?  I'm...
      **Frasier:**[_seeing them together_] _NOOOO!!!_
    _The action GOES INTO SLOW MOTION as the two women shake hands and 
    Frasier dives across the caf e to separate them, knocking Niles aside 
    and sending dish towels and china flying.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - The Piano Bar - Evening
    Frasier is sitting at the bar talking to the bartender as one of the
    patrons (Jack) noodles around on the piano quietly._
    
    [_N.B. The set is the same as Granville's singles bar in[[4.06]](/frasier/transcripts/season_4/episode_6/mixed_doubles.html "Mixed Doubles") "Mixed 
    Doubles."_]
    
      **Frasier:**[_looking around_] You know, this is a charming little place.  
               I live right around the corner but I've never been in before.
    **Bartender:** What'll it be?
      **Frasier:** Martini, straight up, two olives - henceforth known as
               "the usual."
    
    _Niles wanders in and comes over to Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** I called Daphne.  She said you'd be here.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah.
      **Niles:** Cozy room.  I guess it'll have to do, because the old 
             whoremonger won't be going back to Nervosa anytime soon.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.  I'm pretty much exiled from Le Cigar Volant with Faye
             working there.
    
    _The bartender hands Frasier his drink._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
      **Niles:** Well, I plan to get stinkin' tonight. [_to bartender_] May I
             see your wine list?
    
    _Niles studies a small card the bartender hands him as Frasier sips 
    his martini and Martin enters the bar with Eddie on a leash._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, guys.
    **Frasier:** Dad!  What are you doing here?
     **Martin:** I saw Niles's car outside, so I thought I'd stop in for a 
             drink.  I can't go to McGinty's anymore with Bonnie there,
             and Eddie's taking a break from the park.
    **Frasier:** Well, come join us here on Elba.
    _Martin wraps Eddie's leash around a vacant barstool and sits down next 
    to Frasier._
    
    **Bartender:** What can I get you?
       **Martin:** Jameson's on the rocks.
        **Niles:**[_handing back the wine list_] And I'll try the... white.
    
    _The bartender looks amused, but says nothing._
    
      **Niles:** Well, here we are again - losers in love.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I seem incapable 
             of maintaining a relationship.  I date a nice girl like Faye, 
             things seem to be working out, and I seem to find a way to 
             blow it.  It seems to be the pattern of my life.  Well, except 
             with Lilith.  She was just nuts.  
      **Niles:** At least you take your time.  I don't date, I leap.  Headfirst. 
             [_accepting his wine from the bartender_] Thank you.  More often 
             than not I get my heart broken - by Maris... [_sipping the wine 
             and grimacing at its flavor_] By Daphne, even if she didn't 
             know it.  At least Kit only broke my box spring.
    **Frasier:** All I can conclude is that I must have some deeper issues 
             with women that manifest themselves in my behavior.  The
             trick is to pinpoint them.  
      **Niles:** Well, you know what I'm thinking?  I'm thinking of taking
             some time off and going into deep analysis.  
    **Frasier:** That's not a bad idea, Niles.  Stephen Bachman is at the
             absolute pinnacle of psychodynamic research.  Perhaps we
             should see him.
      **Niles:** If we went in together we could get a rate.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.  Shouldn't take more than a year or so...
      **Niles:** I think that's optimistic...
     **Martin:** Jeez, how do you guys get up in the morning?  You want to go 
             into deep analysis?  Listen to me, I'm your father.  There's 
             nothing wrong with either one of you. [_to Frasier_] You dump 
             a woman but you can't get her off your mind, so you end up 
             getting dumped by the other one.  And you should have stayed 
             with the first one anyway, she was hotter. [_to Niles_] And you?  
             You're just learning how to date.  I mean, it would have been 
             nice if it had happened 25 years ago, but you play the cards 
             you're dealt.  Me?  I like Bonnie, Bonnie's dog humps Eddie, 
             I don't like Bonnie anymore.  It doesn't mean I have "issues 
             with women," it's just life, you know?  Good stuff happens and 
             bad stuff happens, that's all.  You've just gotta look on the 
             bright side.  It's like that old song - "You Gotta Accentuate 
             the Positive."
    **Frasier:** Maybe Dad's right.  We do tend to over-analyze things.
     **Martin:** Hey.  I got an idea. [_going over to the piano_] Let's go
             over here.  Let's do a little singing.
      **Niles:** Dad...
     **Martin:**[_to Jack_] Hey, buddy, can you play "Accentuate the Positive"?
       **Jack:** Oh, no, I'm just noodling around.  The real pianist doesn't 
             come till 9:00.
     **Martin:** Well, you can fake it, can't you?
       **Jack:** Well no, not really.  I actually only know three songs -- 
             "America the Beautiful," "Happy Birthday" and "Goldfinger."
    **Frasier:** That's all right, buddy-
     **Martin:** No, come on guys, we were gonna sing a happy song, let's sing 
             a happy song. [_to Jack_] Uh, play "Goldfinger."
      **Niles:** We don't know the words to that.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, you knew it when you were kids!  It'll cheer you 
             up, come on. [_to Jack_] Hit it.
    
    _Reluctantly the guys follow Martin over to the piano and stand 
    awkwardly as Jack launches into "Goldfinger."_  
    
       **Jack:**[_plays opening bars, then sings_] Weh-weh-weh, Weh-weh-weh...
     **Martin:**[_prompting_] Goldfinger...
        **All:**[_singing, Frasier and Niles bored_] "Goldfinger!"
     **Martin:** He's the man, the man with the Midas touch.
        **All:** "He's the man, the man with the Midas touch..."
     **Martin:** A spider's touch.
        **All:** "A spider's touch..."
     **Martin:** Such a cold finger.
    **Frasier:** Dad, this is ridiculous.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, sing it!
        **All:** "Such a cold finger... 
             [_Frasier and Niles start remembering and getting into it_]
             "Beckons you to enter his web of sin..."
     **Martin:** That's it!
        **All:** "But don't go in!"
    _They are singing along and boogeying enthusiastically.
