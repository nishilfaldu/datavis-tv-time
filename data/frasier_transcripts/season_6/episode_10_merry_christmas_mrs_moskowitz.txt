## Premise

    
    
     Whilst Frasier is out shopping for a Hanukah present for Freddie 
     a lady notices him who sets him up with her daughter, Faye.  They 
     have a great relationship until Christmas Eve, when Faye finds out 
     he's not Jewish.  Frasier & Co. put on a Jewish face in order to 
     stop Faye's mother from splitting the two up.  Meanwhile, Niles 
     has got involved with Daphne's multi-cultural Christmas play.

## Reviews

    
    
    **Nicholas Hartley:** 
    This episode was much better than I thought it would be.  It turned 
    out a real splendour with some great gags.  It even had a small Niles 
    and Daphne storyline.  There were many wonderful parts of this 
    including the tree in the bathroom bit.  Absolutely hilarious.  
    My criticisms are the obvious lack of Roz but she had her week 
    last week. **A-**

    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Department Store.
    Roz and Frasier are walking through the store.  Frasier is carrying a 
    bag with a Menorah in it for Frederick._
    
        **Roz:** I thought your father was in charge of Christmas decorations.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, not this year.  We're doing it my way.  That's why 
             I'm ordering a tasteful tree here.  They'll even deliver it on 
             Christmas Eve, fully decorated.
        **Roz:**[_sarcastic_] Gee, that'll be fun for Freddie.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, Frederick won't be joining me this year.  He's spending 
             his vacation on an archaeological tour with Lilith.
        **Roz:** He's spending Christmas with dried-up old bones?
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] I thought I told you, she's taking him on an 
             archaeological tour. [_laughs with Roz_] Oh good lord, 
             look how late it's gotten!
        **Roz:** Well, don't blame me, you're the one who spent twenty minutes 
             looking for that candleholder thing.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, it's a Menorah, Roz.  I thought I'd get one for 
             Frederick for Hanukah.
        **Roz:** Oh, that's right, I completely forgot Frederick is half-Jewish.
    **Frasier:** Yes, between the Crane boy genes and Lilith's contribution, 
             I'm not sure the NFL is holding its breath.
        **Roz:** I need to go over to "Notions" and try to find something for 
             Calvin, the security guard.
    **Frasier:** Oh, what are you getting him?
        **Roz:** If I knew I wouldn't be going to "Notions."
    
    _Roz leaves to the "Notions" part of the store.  Frasier goes to the 
    clothes department and asks the assistant (Sal):_
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, I'd like to get a gift for that woman I was with.  
             Er, how about this sweater right here?
        **Sal:** Excellent choice.
    **Frasier:** I'm not sure of the size, though, could you find me this in a 
             medium?  Thank you.
    _Sal ducks under the counter for the sweater.  Roz comes back._
    
        **Roz:** It's a madhouse in there!
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] Roz!
        **Roz:** People pushing and shoving for nose-hair clippers.  Is there a 
             nasal hair epidemic I don't know about?
        **Sal:**[_rising_] Here's your sweater.
        **Roz:** Is he talking to you?
    **Frasier:**[_covering_] No!  No, no, he's talking...
    
    _A woman, of about fifty, in a red dress - Mrs. Helen Moskowitz - 
    comes to his rescue._
    
      **Helen:** He's talking to me!  It's for my niece.  But I'm a bit worried 
             about the size. [_to Roz_] You know, she's just about your 
             height.  Do you mind my asking, would this fit you?
        **Roz:** Mmm, that's a little big for me.
      **Helen:** What about the color?  A little blah? 
        **Roz:** Personally, I like the blue.
      **Helen:** I agree, thank you so much. [_to Sal_] I will take a smaller 
             size in the blue, and please gift-wrap it.
        **Sal:** Coming right up.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, it looks like "Notions" has thinned out.
        **Roz:** Oh good, so you think Calvin will like the nose hair clippers?
    **Frasier:** Well, I think we can be sure he doesn't own a pair!
    
    _Roz exits to "Notions" again.  Frasier turns to Helen._
    
    **Frasier:** Gosh, thank you so much for bailing me out that way.
      **Helen:** My pleasure. [_shakes his hand_] Helen.  
    **Frasier:** Helen, Frasier.
      **Helen:** Not Frasier Crane, from the radio show?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Helen:** Oh, ha-ho, I listen to you every time I come to Seattle to 
             visit my daughter, Faye. 
    **Frasier:** Well, that's very kind.
      **Helen:** You know, you really should know your wife's size. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, she's not my wife.
      **Helen:** I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.  
    **Frasier:** It's all right.
      **Helen:** Girlfriend?
    **Frasier:** No, I don't have a girlfriend, actually.  I'm unattached.
      **Helen:** Oh.  Well, I've taken enough of your time.  Although, there 
             is one small thing you could help me with.  I'm looking for 
             something for my daughter.
    **Frasier:** Oh, what is it?
      **Helen:** Nah, no, I really shouldn't ask.
    **Frasier:** No, no, please.
      **Helen:** No, no, it's too much of an imposition.
    **Frasier:** No, no.  After the way you came to my rescue, I would be 
             delighted to help you in any way I can.  What is it you're 
             looking to get for your daughter?
      **Helen:** A date with a nice, unattached doctor. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I certainly walked into that one, didn't I?
      **Helen:** It wasn't my first time!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier and Niles are standing in the Cafe as Frasier waits for his date._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, now as soon as this woman gets here give me five 
             minutes and then call me on my cell phone.  If I am miserable 
             I will simply say it's an emergency and excuse myself.
      **Niles:** Ah, yes, the ever-valuable escape call.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you've done them?
      **Niles:** Oh... [_laughs as if he's remembering the time, then stops_] 
             No, but I've seen them done.
    _Niles takes a position at the window seat as Faye - a beautiful woman
    with waves of black hair and an intelligent, forthright manner - 
    enters._
    
    [_N.B. For my money, Amy Brenneman is the most attractive woman Frasier 
    has dated before or since in the whole series - Mike Lee :-)_]
    
       **Faye:** Excuse me, are you Frasier?
    **Frasier:**[_delighted_] Faye? [_she nods_] Yes, hello! [_rises and shakes her 
             hand_] How did you know it was me?
       **Faye:** You had that horror-stricken look of someone who's met my 
             mother.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, [_points to seat_] please, please, shall we?
       **Faye:** Oh, no, that's very sweet of you but you don't have to go 
             through with this.  I really just came to apologize.
    **Frasier:** No, please, please, why don't you sit down?
    
    _Faye does.  Meanwhile, Daphne enters and spots Niles._
    
     **Daphne:** Hey, Dr. Crane.  Are you here with your brother?
      **Niles:**[_points to Frasier_] No, actually he's on a blind date.
     **Daphne:** Oh, he is, isn't he!
    
    _She sits with him.  Niles begins to act nervous around Daphne. 
    He begins fidgeting._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, look at him.  I think he really fancies her.  You know, 
             it's always so obvious when a man likes a woman.
    
    _Niles begins awkward body language._
    
     **Daphne:** You can just tell by his awkward body language.
    
    _Niles begins shifting in his chair._
    
     **Daphne:** Shifting in his chair, he doesn't know quite what to do with 
             his hands.
    
    _Niles realizes his hands are all over the place._
    
     **Daphne:** He's as nervous as a hen. [_shouts_] Oh for God's sake, stop 
             fidgeting!
    _Niles, thinking she's talking to him, stops moving.  Then he realizes 
    she was talking about Frasier.  Meanwhile, Frasier and Faye..._ 
    
    **Frasier:** So, your mother tells me that you're a lawyer.
       **Faye:** Well, that's typical.  I was a lawyer and I quit two years 
             ago, and now I'm a pastry chef. 
    **Frasier:** Really?
       **Faye:** Yes.  I work in a little French restaurant in town.  Maybe 
             you've heard of it?  Le Cigare Volant.
    **Frasier:** My God, it's one of my favorites!  I had dinner there last 
             Friday night.
    
    _They get excited._
    
       **Faye:** I worked there last Friday night, what did you have?
    **Frasier:** The Grand Marquis Souffle. 
       **Faye:** I made that.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it was poetry on a plate.
       **Faye:** Thank you. [_then_] You didn't happen to find my earring in it, 
             did you? [_Frasier gives her a look_] I'm kidding!
    **Frasier:** Oh, [_laughs_] you know, suddenly I'm glad that your mother is 
             as pushy as she is.  It's funny, though, you're nothing like 
             her. 
       **Faye:** That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. [_laughs_] 
    
    _Meanwhile, Daphne gives Niles a proposal:_
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, can I ask a favor?  What are you doing for the 
             next ten nights, because my...
      **Niles:**[_quickly_] Yes. [_Daphne gives him a look_] Excuse me, finish 
             the question.
     **Daphne:** Well, my neighborhood theatre group is putting on a holiday 
             revue; in fact, we're performing in the common room of Dr. 
             Crane's building.
      **Niles:** Right downstairs?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, but we're still looking for a musical director.  I would 
             never ask you but they've put me in charge of the whole thing.
      **Niles:** Oh, well count me in.  Is the show more religious in tone or 
             secular?
     **Daphne:**[_gets out her notes_] Well, we couldn't quite agree.  So we 
             ended up with a mixed bag.  Er, we open with the "no room at 
             the inn" scene, then it's a rousing version of "Jingle Bell 
             Rock," a brief medley from "Jesus Christ Superstar."  And 
             the first act ends with Santa's elves and the three wise men 
             all linking arms and singing "Frosty the Snowman."
      **Niles:** Well... [_gropes for a response_] Excuse me, I have to make a 
             phone call.
    
    _Back to Frasier and Faye.  Frasier is talking of his history._
    
    **Frasier:** Of course I love Boston but well, there's no place like home.
    
    _Frasier's mobile rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me. [_into phone_] Yes, hello?  Uh, yes but you know 
             what, I'll just have to sign those papers later, thank you. 
             [_hangs up_] Office work.
       **Faye:** That was an escape call, wasn't it?
    **Frasier:** No!  What are you talking about?
       **Faye:** Come on, it's a blind date.  You wanted a way to back out. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh, you are sharp, aren't you?  How did you know?
    
    _Faye's mobile starts ringing.  She gives a look as we FADE OUT.
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles is hanging up a stylish wreath in the apartment.  Frasier is on 
    the phone to Faye._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to phone_] Well, that would be just lovely.  All right, 
             I'll see you soon. [_hangs up_] Well, isn't that nice?  
             Faye's dropping by.
      **Niles:** Oh, you've been seeing a lot of her lately, haven't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I have.  You know, she really is quite wonderful.
      **Niles:** Well, I thought she was off to Florida with her mother.
    **Frasier:** Yes, she is.  They're both popping by on the way to the 
             airport.  I guess someone wanted to rack up a few more 
             frequent Frasier miles. [_laughs_]
      **Niles:**[_chucks him on the shoulder, then_] You don't ever actually 
             say those things to the woman, do you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no.
    
    _Daphne enters with costumes on her arm._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh good, Dr. Crane, you're here.
      **Niles:** Yes, the show starts in half an hour.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, could you give me a hand?  I still have to sew the 
             chains to Jacob Marley's tux for the dance number.
      **Niles:** Oh, yeah, happy to.
    **Frasier:** Jacob Marley?  They're doing "A Christmas Carol" too?
      **Niles:** No, they're not.  They worked him into the nativity scene.
    _Niles exits after Daphne.  Martin then enters from his room with 
    "Rudolph" - a big garish wreath with Rudolph popping out of it.  
    His nose looks as if it can glow if plugged in._
    
     **Martin:** Hey Fras', where's a good spot for Rudolph this year?
    **Frasier:** Dad!  Please, I thought we had an agreement about the 
             decorations.
     **Martin:** I know, but what's Christmas without Rudolph?
    **Frasier:** He is not even one of the original reindeer!
     **Martin:** Well, do the others have a song?
    **Frasier:** Look, I'm not having this discussion again!
     **Martin:** It's because you know I'm right.  Well, forget it, I wouldn't 
             want to ruin your designer Christmas!
    _Martin exits to his room as the doorbell sounds.  Frasier answers 
    it to Faye._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Faye. [_hugs her_] Hi, good to see you.  Here, let me take 
             your coat. [_does_] Where's Helen?
       **Faye:** Er, she's talking to your doorman.  She's trying to fix him up 
             with my cousin Janet and I couldn't bear to watch.
    **Frasier:**[_re: door_] We'll just leave that ajar for her then.
    
    _Faye notices the wreath._
    
       **Faye:** Oh my gosh. 
    **Frasier:** What?
       **Faye:** You have a wreath.
    **Frasier:** Yes, so?
       **Faye:** Aren't you Jewish?
    **Frasier:** No, no, why do you ask?
       **Faye:** The day we met my mother saw you shopping for a Menorah.
    **Frasier:** Yes, for my son.  My ex-wife is Jewish.
       **Faye:** Oh, God...
    **Frasier:** Is there a problem?
       **Faye:** Uh, for me, no, but my mother is another story, and here I was 
             wondering what we'd talk about on the seven hour flight to 
             Miami.
    **Frasier:** You know what, I can just take this down.
       **Faye:** Uh, no, no, no, no, I have to stop being a child about these 
             things.  If she's upset, she's upset.
    **Frasier:** How many stopovers do you have?
       **Faye:** Two.
    **Frasier:** I'll take it down.
       **Faye:** Thank you.
    
    _Frasier takes the wreath down._
    
       **Faye:** I really appreciate you doing this.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's no problem.
       **Faye:** I can't believe I'm actually asking you to pretend you to be 
             Jewish on Christmas Eve.
    **Frasier:** It's all right, really, it probably won't even come up.
    
    _There is a knock at the door and Helen enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, there she is!
      **Helen:** Hello, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Helen, hi.
      **Helen:** Oh, what a beautiful apartment you have.
    **Frasier:** Thank you very much.
    _Eddie then jumps up onto the sofa.  He is dressed in a Father Christmas 
    outfit.  Helen's back is turned to him.  Faye looks alarmed._
    
    **Frasier:** GET OUT!
    
    _Eddie runs out._
    
      **Helen:** What?
    **Frasier:**[_covering_] -of that coat already! [_takes it off her_]
    
    _End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two._
    
    **OY TO THE WORLD**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Helen, Faye and Frasier are sitting in the apartment and discussing._
    
      **Helen:** So, Frasier, you grew up in Seattle?
    **Frasier:** Yes, as a matter of fact I did. 
      **Helen:**[_looks at view_] Such a pretty city.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.
      **Helen:** I guess you were bar mitzvahed here?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, yes of course.  What a proud day that was.  I can 
             still remember reading from the Torah before the... the 
             Rabbi... [_struggling_] and the Cantor... and the _Mohel_.
      **Helen:** The _Mohel_?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
       **Faye:**[_helping him_] The one who did your circumcision?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I just wanted to show him that there were no hard 
             feelings. [_notices Niles entering_] Niles!
      **Niles:** Hello all, you must be Faye. [_shakes hand_]
      **Helen:**[_shakes his hand_] And I'm her mother, Helen Moskowitz.
      **Niles:** And I'm Frasier's brother, Niles. [_notices the wreath is gone_] 
             Oh, what happened to the...
    **Frasier:**[_interrupting_] The Moskowitz family that lived down the hall?  
             They moved!  You know, Niles, why don't you come and help me 
             in the kitchen?  I'm just about to pour everybody a drink.
    
    _The camera resets to the kitchen as they both enter._
    
      **Niles:** What's going on?
    **Frasier:** Faye's mother thinks that we're Jewish, just play along.
      **Niles:**[_used to the farce scenario_] Okay. [_pause_] Why?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's important to Faye, Faye is important to me.  
             Do you think you can pull it off?
      **Niles:** No problem. [_checks oven_] Ooh, ham!
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Please.  We've got to find a time to tell Dad about 
             this too.
      **Niles:** You mean Papa.
    **Frasier:** Stop it!
    
    _Frasier pours the wine._
    
      **Niles:** Wait, Frasier, is that for Helen?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** What if she's expecting Jewish wine?
    **Frasier:** Gosh, I'm afraid I don't have any of that on hand.
      **Niles:** It's all right, it's easy enough.  It's just like regular 
             wine plus a little bit of this...
    
    _Niles takes some sugar and puts two teaspoons into the glass._
    
      **Niles:** Try that.
    **Frasier:**[_he does_] It's dreadful!
      **Niles:** Perfect.
    
    _Niles and Frasier enter the room with the wine._
    
    **Frasier:** Here we are. [_hands out wine_]
      **Helen:** Thank you. Who has a nice toast?  Niles?
      **Niles:** Ooh, all right. _L'chaim!  Mazel tov!_  Next year in 
             Jerusalem!
    **Frasier:** Take it down a notch, Tevye.
    
    _Martin enters._
    
     **Martin:** Hey Fras', you know, since it's the night before...
    
    **Frasier/Niles:** Dad!
    
    _Martin notices guests._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, great, would it be a crime for somebody to tell me we had 
             guests here? [_to the women_] Hi, I'm Marty Crane.  I'm Frasier's 
             dad.  Although you'd never guess it from the way I'm treated 
             like a second-class citizen around here. [_sarcastic_] But as 
             long as Frasier's happy, why should my feelings matter?
    
    _Martin exits to the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, why don't you see if you can go help Dad in the kitchen?
      **Niles:** Oh all right, but he'll probably just _kvetch_ at me and frankly 
             I don't need that _tsuris_. [_gives a "how's that?" smile_]
    **Frasier:** Niles! 
    
    _With his back turned to Faye & Helen, Frasier mouths, "HALF THAT!"
    Niles exits to the kitchen as Frasier gives the women a wry smile._
    
    [_N.B. Yiddish: "complain" and "agonies."_]
    
    _Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Martin complains to Niles._
    
     **Martin:** I don't know how to be Jewish.
      **Niles:** Well, just answer questions with a question.
     **Martin:** Like what?
      **Niles:** What, I have to explain everything?
     **Martin:** Can't you give me an example?
      **Niles:** What, I should give you an example?
     **Martin:** Are you going to help me or not?
      **Niles:** You're saying I'm not being helpful?
     **Martin:** Oh, forget it!
    
    _Martin and Niles enter the living room._
    
      **Helen:** So, Marty, both your sons are doctors.  How'd you work that 
             out?
     **Martin:** I've no idea. [_then_] Do I?
    _Everyone looks at each other.  Daphne enters with costumes.  
    Helen begins to dial on her mobile._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I just got the phone call every producer dreads.
      **Niles:** What is it?
     **Daphne:** Someone's dropping out of the show.
    _She goes to the door, then stops and turns around._
     **Daphne:** You don't suppose you could take over one of the roles?
      **Niles:** Well, I don't see why not, I know all the songs.
     **Daphne:** Wonderful.
      **Niles:**[_to ladies_] Well, it was nice meeting you both.
       **Faye:** Likewise.  We're leaving too.  Could you send the elevator 
             back up, we'll be right down.
      **Niles:** Happy to.  So, who dropped out?
     **Daphne:** Mr. Blanchard.
      **Niles:**_Oy!_
    
    _Daphne and Niles exit the apartment._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, it's been great spending some time with the 
             two of you, I wish you could stay longer.
      **Helen:**[_puts mobile down_] Well, actually we can.  I just called 
             the airline.  The plane is delayed an hour.
    **Frasier:** Well, isn't that good news?
      **Helen:** You know, I hate to be forward but I'd love to taste 
             whatever smells so wonderful in that kitchen.
    **Frasier:** And I would love to give you a taste, except it isn't done yet.
    
    _The cooker beeps done._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, more good news!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Faye and Frasier are in the kitchen talking about the farce._
    
    **Frasier:** I don't know how much longer we can continue this charade. 
             My God, when Dad started talking about working on his own 
             car I thought we were goners!
       **Faye:** Well, we only have to keep it up for another half an hour... 
             actually I think I have an idea.  
    **Frasier:** Really?
       **Faye:** Go out there.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
    
    _Frasier exits and the camera resets to the living room.  
    Faye and Martin are waiting._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know what it is with that brisket, it just 
             won't cook through.
      **Helen:** I could take a look.
       **Faye:**[_enters_] No, no, we don't have the time.  I just got off the 
             phone with the airlines, they pushed the flights back up so 
             we really have to get going.
      **Helen:** Oh, really?  Well, all right.
    **Frasier:** Gosh, I wish you could stay longer, it's just I'd hate to 
             have you late for your plane.  
    
    _Frasier opens the door for them to go - however the man from the 
    department store is there with the Christmas tree._
    **Deliverer:** Hello, sir-
    _Frasier quickly shuts the door._
    
    **Frasier:** On the other hand, I can't leave until you've seen the 
             apartment, all right?  
       **Faye:** What?
    **Frasier:** Let's start with the bedroom.  There's plenty of time.
    
    _There's a knock at the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, could you see who it is and make sure they come 
             back later?
     **Martin:** Whatever you want, Frasier, as usual.
    _Frasier, Faye and Helen go to Frasier's room.  Martin answers the door 
    to the deliverer._
    
    **Deliverer:** Hello sir, and let me wish you a merry...
       **Martin:** Shush, shush, bring that thing back in about an hour.
    **Deliverer:** No way sir, it's Christmas Eve, I've got a full truck 
               downstairs.  So where do you want it?
       **Martin:** Oh Jeez, I don't know.
    **Deliverer:** You know, a lot of people put them in their living room.
       **Martin:**[_opens powder room_] Here, here put it in the bathroom.
    **Deliverer:** The bathroom?
       **Martin:** Just put it in, all right?
    **Deliverer:** Okay, I've done some crazy things...
    _Martin, the deliverer and the tree are taken into the powder room and 
    they shut the door behind them.  
    
    Then the front door opens.  It is Niles dressed in his Jesus costume.  
    Niles has a cold and is searching for his nasal spray.  He goes into 
    the kitchen.  Martin then looks out of the powder room._
    
       **Martin:** All right, come on, quick.
    **Deliverer:** Okay.  Well, have a, you know-
       **Martin:** Shut up, get out.
    _Martin pushes him out of the apartment before shutting the powder room 
    door, leaving the tree in there. 
    
    Then, the Moskowitzes and Frasier enter._
    
      **Helen:** That's a beautiful bedroom, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you, thank you very much.
      **Helen:**[_to Faye_] I noticed you were sort of quiet, Faye, almost as 
             though you've been in there before.
       **Faye:**[_sarcastic_] Oh yeah, I have, Ma, but I was drunk and it was 
             dark: I don't remember so much!
      **Helen:**[_to Martin_] You see how she talks to her mother?  _Oy!_
    _At that moment Niles dressed as Jesus walks out of the kitchen.  Helen 
    cannot see him as her back is turned, however Faye and Frasier notice 
    him._
    **Frasier:** Jesus!
    _Niles hurries back into the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** I'll tell you what, I just realized you haven't seen the 
             beautiful balcony.  Dad, would you do the honors and I'll 
             check on the brisket?
    _Martin, Helen and Faye go onto the balcony.  Meanwhile, Frasier meets 
    Niles in the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** What is going on?
      **Niles:** The man who is supposed to do the number from "Jesus Christ 
             Superstar" - he couldn't go on.  He slipped in the shower; 
             the man who could walk on water, but...
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, it's dripping with irony!  Niles, what are you 
             doing here?
      **Niles:** Well, the minute I got within ten feet of the hay for the 
             manger scene, my allergies kicked in.  I think I left my 
             nasal spray here somewhere.
    **Frasier:** I am terribly sorry to tell you this, but you've got to get 
             the hell out of here.
      **Niles:** I don't think that kind of language is appropriate.
    **Frasier:** Oh, just shut up!
    
    _Frasier exits the kitchen and enters the balcony:_
    
    **Frasier:** Would you believe it, it's still pink in the middle.  By the 
             time my brisket's done my _kugel_ will be dry as the Sinai.
    _Niles begins to leave the apartment.  However, on the way out he spots 
    the powder room.  He opens it and finds his nasal spray.  However, 
    when he tries to get out he realizes that the Moskowitzes, Frasier 
    and Martin are coming in from the balcony.  Niles hides back in the 
    powder room._
    
      **Helen:** It certainly is beautiful, but now I think we're cutting it 
             close.
    **Frasier:** Yes, you know, you're quite right.  We can continue the tour 
             at another time.  Let me walk you to the door.
      **Helen:** Thank you so much, Frasier, you're wonderful.  You know, 
             maybe I should go to the powder room before we go.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, allow me.
    _Frasier opens the powder room door.  Because of this he is behind the 
    door and cannot see the scene he has uncovered.  We see Niles, dressed 
    as Jesus, using his nasal spray in front of the Christmas tree.  
    Talk about incriminating.  Faye, Helen and Martin just stare. 
    Frasier looks over the door, yells and shuts the door._
    
      **Helen:** What is going on?
    **Frasier:** Helen, I am so terribly sorry.
    _Niles knocks on the powder room door.  Frasier opens it and Niles 
    enters._
      **Niles:** I'll let you all sort this out, I really have to go.
      **Helen:** I understand, this is your busy time.
    
    _Niles exits via the front door._
    
       **Faye:** Ma, Frasier's not Jewish.  I told them to pretend so you 
             wouldn't freak out.
      **Helen:** What?  Well, I... you think I care, you can date anyone you 
             want!
       **Faye:** Since when?
      **Helen:** I can't believe you're embarrassing me like this.
       **Faye:** You embarrass me on an hourly basis!
      **Helen:** I embarrass you?! [_to Frasier_] Are you hearing this?
    **Frasier:** You know, maybe we should just give you your privacy...
      **Helen:** No one leaves! [_to Faye_] You see, you are making them 
             uncomfortable in their own home.  You could have trusted 
             me to understand.  All I want is for you to be happy. 
       **Faye:** As long as I'm happy in the life that you pick out for me!
      **Helen:** Excuse me for being a terrible mother, all I do is care!
       **Faye:** Oh, here it comes, the guilt!  Just because I don't want you 
             controlling my whole life...
      **Helen:** So what do you want me to do about it, cut myself out of it?!  
             You hate me?!
       **Faye:** Sometimes I DO hate you!
    
    _Faye gasps and covers her mouth, realizing what she has said.
    Helen does the same.  They begin crying._
    
       **Faye:** I'm sorry Ma, I shouldn't have said that.
      **Helen:** Why not?  I am too involved.  It's because you're all I have.
       **Faye:** But you can't keep running my life.
    **Frasier:** Maybe we should just...
      **Helen:** Sit!  We're nearly done.
    
    _Frasier and Martin do and look at each other with amazement._
    
      **Helen:** I have been smothering you.  Maybe it's time I learned to let 
             you go.
       **Faye:** I don't want to be let go.  I want you in my life - just not 
             running it.  I do love you, mom.
      **Helen:** Oh, baby, I love you too.
    
    _Helen and Faye hug crying... and then suddenly:_
    
       **Faye:** Well, we should go.
      **Helen:** Right.
    
    _They go to the door._
    
      **Helen:** Oh, thank you for a lovely visit.  Enjoy your holiday.
    
    _Helen exits._
    
       **Faye:** I am so sorry about all this.
    **Frasier:** That's all right, that's all right. [_hugs her_] Call me when 
             you get back.
    
    _Faye exits._
    
    **Frasier:** Good night. [_closes door_]
     **Martin:** Boy, that was something.
    **Frasier:** It certainly was.  You know, we've had a couple of squabbles 
             today, but nothing like that.
     **Martin:** No way! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Well, maybe I should get that Christmas tree out of the 
             bathroom.
    
    _Frasier gets the tree._
    
     **Martin:** One minute they're talking about one little problem; then 
             suddenly it's everything else.  Then it gets all emotional 
             and messy and then they're hugging and then it's all over. 
    
    _Frasier has now put the tree in its place._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I suppose that's the healthiest way to go about it, 
             huh, Dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, I guess you can't keep that stuff bottled up.
    **Frasier:** No, if you sit on it, you'll just get madder and madder.
     **Martin:** Yeah, best thing is to just lay it on the line!
    **Frasier:** Exactly.
    
    _Pause.  As the following progresses, they get louder and louder._
    
     **Martin:** Frasier, I want my Rudolph out for Christmas.
    **Frasier:** What, this again?
     **Martin:** It's just not Christmas without it!
    **Frasier:** Dad, we had an agreement about the Christmas decorations 
             this year.
     **Martin:** Yeah, but your Christmas stinks.  I mean, do you call that a 
             tree?
    **Frasier:** You know, would it kill you to have a tasteful Christmas just 
             once in your life?  Every year we do Christmas your way.
     **Martin:** And you have things your way every damn day!  I mean look at 
             it, there's nothing of mine around this place except for my 
             chair and you've taken pot shots at that right from the 
             start because it doesn't fit in with your frou-frou knick-
             knacks!
    **Frasier:** Oh that's right, Dad, go ahead, ridicule everything I do: 
             the way I eat, the way I decorate.  Do you have any idea how 
             that makes me feel?
     **Martin:** Do you know how it makes me feel to live like a guest in my 
             own home?
    **Frasier:** Dad, I do everything I can to make you feel welcome in this 
             house, but nothing I ever do is good enough!
     **Martin:** A strange way of making me feel welcome: taking Christmas away 
             from me - the one time of the year when I get to do things my 
             way!  Like it used to be in our home, with your mother and 
             when you were kids!  You know, that's a nice memory for me, 
             you'd think as a psychiatrist you'd figure that out!
    **Frasier:** Fine, I'm not even a good psychiatrist!  I guess I'm just a 
             big fat let-down, aren't I?!
     **Martin:** And I'm just a burden to you, AND I HATE LIVING HERE!
    **Frasier:** AND I HATE YOU LIVING HERE!
    _Similar to Faye and Helen, Martin and Frasier realize what they said. 
    They begin crying._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my God.
     **Martin:** Oh, Jeez.
    **Frasier:** Oh God, I feel terrible.
     **Martin:** So do I.  They were hugging by now!
    **Frasier:** We never should have tried this, we're not Jewish.
     **Martin:** Maybe Mrs. Shapiro next door can talk us through it?
    **Frasier:** She's out of town.
     **Martin:** Oh, no. [_cries_] I'm sorry, I never should have said what 
             I said.
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad, no, I should have been more sensitive.  I am a 
             psychiatrist.
     **Martin:** And you're a damned good one too, and I'm very proud of you.
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad, I didn't mean any of the things I said.  I love 
             having you here.
     **Martin:** I love being here.  I always have.
    **Frasier:** Honestly?
     **Martin:** Well, no, but I thought it would get us to the hug!
    **Frasier:** All right, let's try.
    
    _Frasier and Martin hug whilst still tearful._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier's Apartment - The apartment is fully decorated.  Rudolph is 
    above the fire with his nose flashing.  There is tinsel around the 
    place.  We then see the Christmas tree: a large one covered in lots 
    of decoration.  We also see milk and cookies on the side which Eddie 
    eats, whilst dressed in his Christmas Santa costume.
