    [_N.B. This is the second episode, after[[1.24]](/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_24/my_coffee_with_niles.html "My Coffee With Niles"), "My Coffee With Niles," 
    that was shot in "real time."_]
    
    _ACT ONE_ 
    
    **DINNER PARTY**
    _Scene One - Apartment
    In Frasier's living room Niles is playing an elegant classical piece 
    on the piano by Bach whilst Frasier listens._
    
    **Frasier:** You know Niles, I think I'm going to have a dinner party.
             Care to co-host?
      **Niles:**[_stops playing_] I love the idea, what's the occasion?
    **Frasier:** I got the idea last night when we bumped into Jean and
             Hollis Ashley at the symphony, I've always wanted to get 
             to know them better.
      **Niles:** Me too, they're such a charming couple: they remind me of
             Maris and me when we were happy. [_pours himself a drink_]
    **Frasier:**[_doorbell_] Really?  I must have been sick that day!
    
    _Frasier answers the door: It's Roz wearing an elegant long dress. 
    She is carrying a red dress in a bag._
    
    **Frasier:**[_delighted_] Oh, well Roz...
        **Roz:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** Is that your dry cleaning?
        **Roz:** No, it's Daphne's.  Alice spit up on her dress so I had to
             have it dry-cleaned for her.  I also had to buy her new shoes
             and detail her car, I've never seen a kid so sick! 
     **Daphne:**[_enters from bedroom in dressing gown_] Hey Roz, you look 
             gorgeous.
        **Roz:** How much time do we have?
     **Daphne:** Twenty minutes.  I better get changed.
      **Niles:** Where are you going?
        **Roz:** Daphne has friends at the British Consulate and they're
             having a big reception tonight, she has an invitation.
     **Daphne:**[_excited_] Yes, who knows Roz?  Maybe you'll meet some
             English lord who'll make you a lady. 
    
    _Daphne and Roz exit to Daphne's room laughing._
    
      **Niles:** I think at this point it would take the actual Lord to make
             her a lady. 
    **Frasier:** Well let's pick a date for our party. [_picks up book_] Got 
             your book?
      **Niles:** Hmm. 
    
    _Niles and Frasier look through their diaries, checking dates:_
    
    **Frasier:** The 1st is no good.
      **Niles:** No: wine club.  The second?
    **Frasier:** Library fundraiser.  Third?
      **Niles:** No.  Fourth, fifth, sixth?
    **Frasier:** No. [_turns page_] No, no, no. 
      **Niles:** What about the 11th?
    **Frasier:** No, concert tickets.
      **Niles:** I don't have that marked.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm taking a date.
      **Niles:** Well isn't that nice. [_writes in_] 11th, "expect desperate
             last minute call from F."  Anything the next week?
    **Frasier:** No, no... [_notices_] Oh, I've got the 19th.
      **Niles:**[_excited_] I've got the 19th!
    **Frasier:** The 19th it is then.
      **Niles:** Huzzah!
    
    _Martin enters from the front door._ 
    
     **Martin:** Hey, boys.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** What's up?
    **Frasier:** Well actually, after an unusually protracted game of dueling
             date books, Niles and I have set a mutually acceptable
             evening for an intime soiree. [_pause_] We're having a dinner
             party!
     **Martin:** Oh, sounds good! Any date but the 19th!
      **Niles:** Well, what is wrong with the 19th?
     **Martin:** My poker game's here that night.
    **Frasier:** Can't you reschedule it?
     **Martin:**[_angry_] No!  It's always the third Saturday of the month 
             and everybody shows.  Jimmy once postponed his daughter's 
             wedding just so that he could be here, and if you ever saw 
             his daughter you'd know how risky that was. 
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know we wouldn't ask if there was any other date
             that worked! 
     **Martin:** Do you really expect me to give up my game so you can have 
             one of your intime soirees?
      **Niles:** I knew he knew what that meant!
    **Frasier:** Dad, please, couldn't you at least make a few calls?
             [_thinking_] I tell you what, if you can change the day -
             I'll cover your losses that night.
     **Martin:**[_swayed a little_] Well all right, I'll try.  But you know,
             these guys live pretty busy lives - I can't always get in
             touch with them. 
      **Niles:** Let's hope that dog track has a PA system. 
    
    _Martin exits to his bedroom._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Alright, Niles, back to our party... got any thoughts on a 
             caterer?
      **Niles:**[_excited_] Well... Cornell Evans.  He's pricey but he's the
             best. 
    **Frasier:** Let's book him. [_goes to phone_]
      **Niles:** Oh marvelous!
    
    _Frasier picks up the phone but it seems Martin's on the line:_
    
    **Frasier:**[_to phone_] Oh, I'm sorry Dad, I didn't know you were on the
             line. [_hangs up_]
    _Daphne and Roz walk out of the bedroom. Daphne is now wearing the red 
    dress._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my goodness.
     **Daphne:** Well we're off to the ball, don't wait up for us. [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** Daphne, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's something on the
             back of your dress.
    
    _Niles directs us to a white spot on the backside of her dress._
    
     **Daphne:**[_looks round_] Oh my God, it looks like bleach or something!
             The dry cleaner must have done it!
        **Roz:** I saw it, it's nothing.
     **Daphne:** You saw it?!
        **Roz:** Don't worry, it's hardly noticeable.
     **Daphne:**[_distraught_] Dr. Crane noticed it! 
        **Roz:** That's because he's always looking at your...
      **Niles:**[_quickly_] Roz! 
     **Daphne:** Well, I can't go now!
        **Roz:** Why not?!
     **Daphne:** This is the only formal dress I've got.
        **Roz:** Wait!  I've got the rest of my dry cleaning down in the car, 
             I bet I have something you can wear, I'll be right back. 
    
    _Roz leaves the front door._
    
      **Niles:**[_taking out a tissue and wetting it_] You know Daphne, I bet
             I would be able to get that out for you. [_goes to touch it_]
     **Daphne:** No!  The cleaner's spoiled it, he can damn well fix it!
             [_exits_]
      **Niles:** It would just take...
    
    _Niles goes to Daphne's room but is stopped by Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on cellular_] Can I speak to Cornell, please?  Yes, of course 
             I'll hold. 
      **Niles:**[_going to room again_] Daphne, I mean it, if I just had a
             toothbrush and a jeweler's...
    **Frasier:** Niles!
    
    _Niles walks back to the main room with his head low. 
    
    A few minutes later Frasier is still on his cellular._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] How long is he going to keep me on hold! 
      **Niles:**[_Roz enters_] Hey Roz, did you find any kind of thing... 
    
    _Roz runs to the room without a word._
    
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Hello Cornell, yes Frasier Crane here.  Listen,
             I'm hoping that you're not booked on the 19th.  Oh Lord, yes
             I understand that... yes, same to you.  Alright, bye-bye.
             [_puts phone down_] Damn!  Don't you know it, the only date he's 
             got free is the 11th.  Damn those concert tickets!
      **Niles:** Oh, you know who might be available: Tyler Wilkins.
    **Frasier:** Doesn't he work with Cornell?
      **Niles:** Oh, dear God, no.  They are mortal enemies: they were catering 
             a seafood banquet when Cornell flew into a rage because Tyler 
             had ordered Mahi Mahi instead of Ahi.  Of course, Tyler blamed 
             it on Cornell's stutter and they haven't spoken since. [_into 
             phone_] Tyler, Niles Crane, yes.  I was wondering if you were 
             available on the 19th?  Wonderful, dinner for... 10.  That's 
             great, I'll call you later on and we'll discuss the menu.  
             Thanks, bye-bye. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** That is wonderful, alright, [_writing list_] now you, me and
             the fabulous Ashbys.  That leaves six chairs to fill.
      **Niles:** Well, we'll have to have Joan and Ted Birkin, that's a no-
             brainer. 
    **Frasier:** Technically that's two no-brainers, forget the Birkins. 
      **Niles:** Wait a minute, you can't just steamroll over me, I want the
             Birkins! 
    **Frasier:** I don't!
      **Niles:** Well, I do!
    **Frasier:** All right, we each have a right to blackball, let's say,
             three guests.  We will each get an equal voice. 
      **Niles:** That's fair enough.
    
    _Frasier brings over the nut tray. Niles gets three nuts and Frasier 
    gets three nuts.  Frasier then places a bowl on the table._
    
    **Frasier:** That's three for me and three for you.  And just to get the
             blackball rolling... [_throws one in bowl_] Bye-bye, Birkins!
      **Niles:** What about John and Carol Peterson, everyone loves them.
    **Frasier:** Not everyone! [_throws his second in bowl_] Blackball!
      **Niles:** Why?!
    **Frasier:** No, no, we never question the blackball.  We just bow to its
             will. 
      **Niles:** Fine, Nina and Arch Duncan.
    **Frasier:** "The Drunken Duncans?!"  Have you lost your... [_realizes_] 
             Wait a minute.  You loathe the Duncans, you just want me to 
             waste a blackball.
      **Niles:** That's insane, I adore the Duncans.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, perhaps I misjudged them.  Very well Niles, the
             Duncans it is. [_slowly writing_] Nina and Arch...
      **Niles:** Oh, stop it, they're hideous! [_throws in his first_] Blackball!  
             What about the Walburts?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I like the Walburts. 
      **Niles:** Finally.  Gordons?
    **Frasier:** I love the Gordons, now we're rolling. 
      **Niles:** How about the DiFalcos?
    **Frasier:**[_throws in last_] Blackball!  She is a twit.  How about
             the Whitneys?
      **Niles:**[_throws in second_] Blackball!  He's a dolt. [_Frasier begins 
             eating another nut_] Cromwells?
    **Frasier:**[_throws in nut_] Blackball!
      **Niles:** Look, if you're gonna... [_notices it wasn't official_] Wait a 
             minute, you're out of blackballs... this is a dried-up old
             fig!
    **Frasier:** So is Lucy Cromwell, I don't want her at my party. 
      **Niles:** The Cromwell's are in - the guest list is complete.  Now let's 
             start calling everyone.
    **Frasier:** Yes - starting with our guests of honor: the Ashbys.
             [_dials then in phone_] Hello Hollis, Frasier Crane calling.
             Listen, Niles and I are planning on having a dinner party on
             the 19th and... oh. [_to Niles_] They're leaving to Africa on
             the 19th. [_into phone_] Oh, gee that's a shame.  We were 
             sorta building the evening around you.  Oh! [_to Niles_] 
             They've got the 11th free.
      **Niles:** No good, we've got that concert.
    **Frasier:** I didn't ask you to that. [_to phone_] The 11th should be just 
             fine.  Oh no, they've got a conflict.  Oh, well that's no 
             problem - they were our very next call.  We absolutely adore 
             the Duncans.  All right, we'll see you then. [_hangs up_]
      **Niles:** Not the drunken Duncans?!
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry Niles, they've got plans for the Ashbys on the 
             11th, so they're invited too.
      **Niles:** Well, I want my blackball back. [_takes it_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, the blackball was dropped, it can never be...
      **Niles:** Shut up!
    **Frasier:** At least we're getting the Ashbys - in fact, you know what?
             There's an additional plus - seeing as we're changing our
             plans to the 11th, it means Cornell can cater.
      **Niles:** Oh quick, you call Cornell, I'll call Tyler and tell him
             we're canceling. [_into phone_] Tyler.  It's Niles Crane
             again.  Yes, listen, it turns out we're not going to need 
             you on the 19th.
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Yes, Cornell please.
      **Niles:** No, no, no, we're not going with someone else.  Cornell?! 
             [_laughs_] What gave you that idea?!
    **Frasier:** Cornell, Frasier Crane.  Listen, we've changed our party
             plans and...
    
    _Niles and Frasier continue chatting to the two enemy chefs.  Niles 
    walks towards Frasier and vice versa, however they brush past each 
    other and drop their mobiles.  They don't know who's phone is who's, 
    however Frasier has an idea._
    
    **Frasier:**[_smelling phone_] This one's mine, I can smell my cologne! 
    
    _They begin talking into the phone - Niles acts as if he's talking to 
    Tyler and Frasier seems to be talking to Cornell. However they both 
    stop, realize, then switch phones.  However by this time the angry 
    chefs have hung up._
    
      **Niles:** Well, thanks to your keen sense of smell, we've lost both
             caterers.  I suppose we can always get Kiki Price.
    **Frasier:** She still in business?
      **Niles:** Yes, they dropped the charges!
    **Frasier:**[_delighted_] Oh.  I better phone the Duncans, hope we can
             catch them before "Happy Hour"! [_dials then into phone_]
             Hello, Nina. [_aside_] Too late! [_into phone_] Frasier Crane 
             calling.  Listen, Niles and I are having the Ashbys over and
             a few other people for a dinner and we were hoping that you
             could join us on the 11th... Don't cry, Nina, please.  Yes,
             well, I've always loved you too.  What?  Joaquin?  Joaquin 
             is coming in from Argentina, you'd like him to, to join us... 
             well?
      **Niles:**[_whispers excitedly_] Joaquin?!  Joaquin Warens, he's the
             conductor of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic.
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] My God, that's right, they were just down there,
             they must have met him. [_to Nina_] We would love to have
             Joaquin join us!  Oh, that's splendid.  Alright, right, then
             we'll see you on the 11th.  The 11th.  Alright, take two
             swizzle sticks and stand them up side by side.  Eleven, that's
             right. 
      **Niles:** We've got Joaquin! [_excited_]
    **Frasier:** Well, don't cry for me, Arch & Nina!  Alright, let's see, 
             we've got the Duncans and Joaquin, and that means we're going 
             to have to cut out two couples.  Well, the Cromwells and the...
      **Niles:** Gordons!
    **Frasier:** The Gordons.  That leaves us short by one, we need a single
             female. 
    
    _At this point, as if by cue, Roz walks on from Daphne's bedroom._
    
      **Niles:** Oh Roz, perfect timing. 
        **Roz:** What's up?
      **Niles:** We're having a dinner party and we need an interesting single 
             woman. [_she smiles_] Do you know anybody?  We're desperate!
        **Roz:**[_angrily she enters the kitchen_] Excuse me!
    **Frasier:** Naturally we thought of you first, Roz, but this isn't really 
             your kind of crowd.
        **Roz:** What?  Sophisticated, cultured, is that why you don't think 
             I'd fit in with your snooty elitist friends, I'm not genteel
             enough?!
    **Frasier:** Now Roz...
        **Roz:** Now Roz, my ass.  I'm just as refined as you are.  Shut up,
             Niles! 
    
    _Roz exits to Daphne's bedroom as Martin enters from his with some 
    news._
    
     **Martin:** Well, I hope you're satisfied.  I got everyone to change.
             We're gonna have it on the 11th. 
    **Frasier:** The 11th?!
     **Martin:** Yeah, and it wasn't easy either, Mel had to reschedule his
             polyp surgery.
      **Niles:** Well Dad, you are really going to laugh at this.  Frasier 
             and I rescheduled our dinner party for the 11th. [_laughs_]
     **Martin:**[_mad_] I'm not changing it back!  I'm not!
    **Frasier:** Now Dad, I would never even consider asking you to do such a
             thing.  I tell you what, there's no reason why we can't hold
             both parties simultaneously.  The apartment's certainly big
             enough.
     **Martin:**[_smugly_] I know what you're trying to do, and it won't work!
    **Frasier:** What, dad?  I'm serious, no, no, we can share the buffet table 
             and we can even have the harpist learn a couple of Bobby Darin 
             tunes for your crowd!
     **Martin:** I can stand it if you can! [_smug smile_]
    **Frasier:** Of course, we will have to dim the lights at one point.  
             You see, Nina Duncan always insists on sharing her extensive
             collection of slides from the summer she danced Agamemmnom 
             at Jacob's Pillow.
     **Martin:**[_smug smile until he breaks_] All right, I'll change it.
             [_leaves to bedroom_]
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] You call Kiki, and the Walburts.  And I'll talk 
             to Roz.
      **Niles:** I'm on it!
    
    _Meanwhile, in Daphne's bedroom, Roz and Daphne are searching through 
    clothes.  Daphne is holding clothes up to her._
    
        **Roz:**[_impatient_] Come on, pick something!
     **Daphne:** Pick what?! [_throws normal dress down_] This one isn't dressy 
             enough! [_throws a blue dress down_] This one doesn't fit.
             [_picks up a glittery blue dress which covers only everything 
             between the cleavage and the thighs_] And this one, well, 
             it's hardly appropriate for a posh cocktail reception!
    **Frasier:**[_walks in_] Excuse me, Roz, listen, I just came to apologize.
        **Roz:**[_angry_] Whatever!
     **Daphne:** What happened?
        **Roz:** He said I wasn't classy enough to come to his fancy dinner
             party!
    **Frasier:** Roz, you know I didn't mean that.
     **Daphne:** Oh, get in line.  I've lived here for six years and the only
             time I'm asked to that table is when I'm holding a freakin'
             serving spoon!
    **Frasier:** It's just a silly dinner party, what's everyone getting so
             upset about?
     **Daphne:** Oh, let's just go. [_picks up showy glittery dress_] Oh, I
             suppose this color might look nice on me after all. 
      **Niles:**[_enters_] I've left messages for Kiki and the Walburts.
        **Roz:** Could you two please leave, so Daphne can change!
      **Niles:**[_notices Daphne's dress_] Daphne, you're not actually going
             out in that, are you? [_laughs politely_]
    
    _Daphne throws the dress away and falls back onto the bed._
    
     **Daphne:** That's it, I'm staying home.   
        **Roz:** No, just try it, we can accessorize it.
      **Niles:** With what?!  A lamp post and a public defender?!
    _Roz pushes Niles and Frasier out of the door.  As they enter the main 
    room they hear a beep and whirring noise from the answering machine._
    **Frasier:** Lord, was that the answering machine? [_listens to message_]
    **Allison:**[_from phone_] Hi, it's Allison Walburt.  And, yes, count us in 
             for the 11th.  Looking forward to it, bye. 
    **Frasier:** That's wonderful, I so enjoy the Walburts. 
    
    _However, it seems the tape hasn't finished yet - Allison's left the 
    phone of the hook._
    
      **Harry:**[_from phone_] Who was that?
    **Allison:**[_from phone_] We just got invited to a dinner party at Dr. 
             Crane's.
      **Harry:** Which Dr. Crane?
    **Allison:** Does it matter?  You get the one, you get that other one.
             Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little...
      **Harry:** Is that thing off the hook?
    **Allison:** Oh my God! [_hangs up_]
    
    _Frasier and Niles look at each other as they switch it off. 
    
    End Of Act One (Time: 13:15)
    
    Act Two. 
    The scene resumes where it left off.  Frasier and Niles have just 
    switched off the answer phone._
    
      **Niles:** What you suppose she meant by that?
    **Frasier:** Obviously, she thinks we're always together.  That we're
             some sort of "couple." 
      **Niles:** That's ridiculous, we spend lots of times apart. [_takes a 
             bit of fluff from Frasier's jacket like a wife would do to
             her husband_] Besides, who is she to talk?  Look at her and
             Harry - they go everywhere together.
    **Frasier:** They're married, Niles!  Still, there's no reason for her to
             call us odd!
      **Niles:** Wait, she never called us odd - listen. 
    
    _Frasier replays the tape:_
    
    **Allison:** Does it matter?  You get the one, you get that other one.
             Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little...
      **Harry:** Is that thing off the hook?
    **Allison:** Oh my God! [_hangs up_]
    
    _Frasier hangs it up._
    
      **Niles:** You see, she never said odd - we're getting upset over nothing.
    **Frasier:** Nothing?!  Is there a good end to that sentence?!  
             "Personally, I think the whole arrangement is a 
             little..."  What?!  Charming?!
      **Niles:** Really, will you stop overreacting?
    **Frasier:** Perhaps she has a point.  Ever since your divorce you have
             become more and more attached to me.  Maybe that's why she
             said what she said. 
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** You get Frasier, you get that Niles!
      **Niles:** She didn't say that.  She said "you get the one, you get that 
             other one."  What makes you think that you're the one and I'm 
             that other one?!
    **Frasier:** I am the one giving the party, and you are that other one!
      **Niles:** I'm the one that invited her, so that makes you that other 
             one!
    
    _They carry on fighting for a while._
    
      **Niles:** This is absurd!  Why don't we just call Allison up and ask her 
             what she thinks is so strange about us?  We can both get her 
             on an extension.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Better yet, why don't we just get on a bicycle
             built for two, ride over there and ask her what she thinks
             is so strange about us!
    _The phone goes which stops them in their tracks.  Frasier picks it up -- 
    it's Nina Duncan - so he makes a "drunk" sign._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on phone_] Hello.  Yes, hello Nina.  Alright, what can I do
             for you?  No, no, dear, you called me.  Oh yes, Joaquin can
             only eat certain foods - well, yes I'd be glad to accommodate
             them.  Let's see, alright... [_Niles writes it down_] Rice, 
             beans, jerked beef.  Any particular reason?  I see. 
             Interesting.  OK.  Bye. [_hangs up_]
      **Niles:** Why is Joaquin on such a strict diet?
    **Frasier:** Because the Joaquin they're bringing to dinner is... [_falls
             on sofa_] ...their foster child!  From a tiny village on the
             pompus.  He speaks no English and he gets nauseated when he
             eats American food!
      **Niles:**[_confused_] So, he's not the conductor of the Buenos Aires
             Philharmonic?
    **Frasier:** Oh, you are so that other one! [_calming down_] Where are we
             going to find someone to babysit a nine year old child?
    _At this moment, again in perfect timing, Roz walks on as she finishes 
    shouting to an off-stage Daphne:_
    
        **Roz:** Quit your blubbering and just pick something, dammit!
    **Frasier:** Roz- 
        **Roz:** Now what?!
    **Frasier:** You were right.  You know, you would be a welcome addition 
             to any party.
        **Roz:** Oh, you don't have to say that.
    **Frasier:** No honestly, Niles and I want you to join us for dinner. 
        **Roz:** You mean it?
    **Frasier:** In fact, we're having someone who might make a very 
             interesting dinner companion for you.
        **Roz:** He's not some stuffy old coot, is he?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no..
      **Niles:**[_truthful_] Young!
    **Frasier:** Yes, very young!
        **Roz:** OK, thanks!
    _Roz walks back to Daphne's room as Martin enters from his bedroom._
    
    **Frasier:** Not exactly my wish list, but at least we've got the Ashbys. 
      **Niles:** Allison Walburt can say what she wants, why should we care a
             whit about what anybody else thinks.  Am I right?
    **Frasier:** Absolutely! [_to Martin_] Dad, do you think we're odd?!
     **Martin:**[_tactical_] No, you're not odd.  You're just special!  Your 
             mother told me that when you were kids and I still believe it. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, but do you think we spend too much time together?
    
    _They enter the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** You're close, lots of brothers are close.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I suppose you're right about that.  The Gershwins, the
             Wright Brothers... 
      **Niles:** I told you we were getting upset over nothing.
     **Martin:**[_laughs_] Course, then there were the Collier brothers!
      **Niles:** Collier brothers?
     **Martin:** Couple of nuttos that shared an apartment in New York their
             whole lives.  They even built a maze out of newspapers in 
             there that only they knew how to get through.  They collapsed
             on one of them and the other one just sat there with the
             dead body until the neighbors complained about the smell!
             [_laughs_] Pretty crazy story. [_gets beer_] You recycle right,
             Niles? [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea if we went
             our own ways a bit more.
      **Niles:** It's possible we have grown a tad dependent on one another.
             [_again takes a bit out of Frasier's jacket_]
    **Frasier:** Perhaps this is just the warning we need.  Today we're 
             planning a dinner party... tomorrow we're wearing matching 
             pajamas and washing each other's hair!  Let's face it, Niles,
             we are one stone's throw away from becoming the neighborhood 
             kooks!  Right down to the local children ringing our doorbell 
             and running away. 
      **Niles:** Now Frasier, you are letting your imagination get the better
             of you.  Come on, let's go make a seating chart.
    **Frasier:** You always know how to cheer me up.
    
    _Frasier and Niles enter the main room as Daphne enters from her room 
    in Roz's dress._
    
      **Niles:** Oh Daphne, isn't that Roz's dress?
     **Daphne:** Yes, it was really the only thing that looked good on me.
             [_calling_] Come on, Roz, we don't want to be late!
    
    _Roz enters wearing the showy glittery blue dress._
    
     **Daphne:** Doesn't she look beautiful!
        **Roz:**[_angry_] Oh, shut it, Daphne!  I know you think I look like a
             hooker.
     **Daphne:** No, I said it made me look like a hooker.  On you... well, it
             works.
    _As Roz storms out of the apartment, Daphne follows her and closes the 
    door.  The phone goes and Frasier answers._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on phone_] Hello?  Yes, yes.  Oh Lord, I'm so sorry you can't 
             make it.  That's all right.  Yes, some other time.  Goodbye. 
             [_hangs up_]
      **Niles:** Please not the Ashbys.
    **Frasier:** Family emergency.  Apparently it's so urgent they didn't 
             have time to think up a plausible excuse! 
      **Niles:** So where does that leave us?
    **Frasier:** Well, let's see... we have a third-rate caterer with a record, 
             a couple of lushes, a couple who think we're both nutcases, 
             an Argentine wild child and Roz! [_throws down list_] Dinner is 
             served!
      **Niles:**[_realizing_] I still have one blackball left.
    **Frasier:** At this point I don't think one is going to make any 
             difference.
      **Niles:** It will to me, I'm using it on myself. [_black balls himself_] 
             Blackball!
    
    _However, Frasier is angry with him and claims you cannot blackball 
    yourself.  They begin grappling at the bowl until all the balls shoot 
    out.  Frasier steadies himself._
    
    **Frasier:** We are the Collier brothers!  Why don't we just face the
             inevitable: let us just cancel the whole damn thing.
      **Niles:** Of course, canceling the party twenty minutes later -
             people'll think we're strange!
    **Frasier:** Frankly, I'm sick and tired about giving a damn about what
             other people think.  You know, most of them are one ball away
             from not being here in the first place.
      **Niles:** You're right.  So we spend a lot of time together, so what?  
             I enjoy it.
    **Frasier:** So do I, Niles.  You know, why don't we make those calls
             tomorrow to cancel?  I'm famished, why don't we just head
             over to "Companion" for dinner, my treat. 
      **Niles:**[_excited_] You're on. [_laughing_] Unless you think it's too odd 
             to have dinner together. [_gets coat_] 
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] I don't think we're in any danger of that.  If our
             relationship became truly odd I think we're both intelligent
             enough to recognize the signs.
    _The doorbell sounds so they go to answer it.  There is nobody there,
    but a distant sound of children giggling.  Niles, recognizing the 
    signs, decides to forget dinner and just go home.
    
    End Of Act Two. (Time: 21:33)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    An irate Frasier resumes where he left off.  After saying goodnight 
    to Niles he enters the kitchen and picks up some stacks of paper.  He 
    then takes them outside to be recycled.
