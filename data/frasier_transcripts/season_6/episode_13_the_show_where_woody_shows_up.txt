    _Act One
    Scene One - KACL, Frasier's show. 
    Audrey has called in._
    
     **Audrey:**[_v.o._] So, Dr Crane, I don't see why I should fix the dumb 
             dress when my sister can't even fit into it anymore.
    **Frasier:** Audrey, you borrowed the dress, you tore it.  As an old Greek 
             haberdasher once said: "Euripedes, Eumenides." [_laughs_]
     **Audrey:** What?
    **Frasier:** It's just a little joke on the ancient dramatist Euripedes and
             the mythological Furies.
     **Audrey:** Huh?
    **Frasier:** Just fix the dress. [_line off_] We'll be back after the weather.
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes in, Frasier fishes out a gift box._
    **Frasier:** Uh Roz, Noel gave me this to give to you.
        **Roz:**[_taking gift_] Oh God, Noel.  He's been acting so weird lately.
    **Frasier:** Lately?  May I remind you this is the man required by law to 
             stay at least 100 yards away from William Shatner?
        **Roz:** No, I bumped into him at Nervosa about a month ago, there were
             no other free tables so we sat together and ever since then 
             he's been acting like we're some kind of a couple.
    **Frasier:** Oh come on, Roz.  I'm sure he knows that you're not interested 
             in him.
        **Roz:**[_showing Frasier the gift tag_] "Happy Monthaversary."
    **Frasier:** Oh, Lord. [_Roz goes back to her booth_] We're on. [_on air_] 
             And we're back, let's get straight to the phones.  I'm 
             listening.
      **Woody:**[_v.o._] Dr Crane?  It's Woody.  I'm in Seattle and I'm a little 
             lost.
    **Frasier:** Well Woody, in today's fast-paced, high-pressure society 
             that's not uncommon.  Just why exactly do you feel lost?
      **Woody:** Well, I've been driving around for about an hour, I can't
             seem to get out of the airport.
    **Frasier:**[_the penny drops_] Oh, _Woody_ Woody.  Oh well, listeners, this
             is an old friend of mine from back in Boston.  Well, how you 
             doin' there, you old cowpoke?
      **Woody:** I was doing okay, but all this talk about today's fast-paced, 
             high-pressure world's starting to get me down.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well I have just the cure for that.  How about dinner?
      **Woody:** Sounds great.  I'm in town all week. 
    **Frasier:** And I'm free all week.  How's tonight?
      **Woody:** That'd be great.  So I hear you're on the radio?
    **Frasier:** Yes I am, Woody.  And so are you.
      **Woody:** No, no, no.  I'm still tending bar at Cheers.  How do these
             rumors get started?
    **Frasier:** Believe it or not, listeners, Woody and I are picking up right
             where we left off.
    _While Frasier gets on with the show, Noel Shempsky comes into Roz's 
    booth._
       **Noel:** Knock knock?
        **Roz:** Noel...
       **Noel:** Oh, I haven't seen that outfit before, set your phasers on 
             stunning.
        **Roz:** Listen, I need to talk to you.  I can not accept anniversary 
             gifts.
       **Noel:** Oh, I know that.  I was just making a little joke.  I know 
             we're just friends.  I saw this and it made me think of you.
        **Roz:** Okay.  Thanks.
       **Noel:**[_as he leaves_] Oh, if you're not going to open it for a while,
             you might want to move the the ribbon.  It's blocking the air 
             holes.
    
    _Roz very quickly puts the box down.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin is at the table looking at Eddie, who is sitting on The Chair 
    with his head resting on the side table.  Daphne enters from the 
    kitchen._
     **Daphne:** Here.  I made you some lamb stew.
     **Martin:** I'm telling you, there's something weird about Eddie.
     **Daphne:** Oh, for the love of God, not this again.
     **Martin:** You never should have taken him to those dog groomers.
     **Daphne:** I had to bring him.  His toenails were like Howard Hughes's 
             and his breath smelled like an autopsy.
     **Martin:** Well, look at him.  They did something to him.  The sparkle's 
             gone from his eyes.
     **Daphne:** Yes, and so are those gooey green bits.
    
    _Frasier enters from the bedroom as the front door bing-bongs.
    He's dressed in sweatshirt and jeans._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh.  That's probably Woody.  I'll get it. [_opens door_] 
             Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_entering_] Hello, Frasier.  I know this is impromptu, but 
             I'm going to an oboe recital and I thought you might want 
             to join me.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry, Niles.  An old friend of mine came in from 
             out of town, I invited him to come over this evening.
      **Niles:** Well, have him join us.  I'm sure we can get three seats 
             together.
    **Frasier:** Ah well, I'm not sure an oboe recital's what I had in mind, 
             I was thinking of something a little more raucous.
      **Niles:** Well, if it's raucous you're looking for, we could go and 
             get a nightcap at the piano bar at the Mayflower Hotel - 
             It's Jerome Kern night!  Last time people were shouting out 
             requests without raising their hands!
    **Frasier:** No, I'm afraid we'll have to pass.  You see, my friend Woody 
             is an old bar chum from back at Cheers. [_the doorbell bing 
             bongs.  Frasier goes to answer it_] What I had in mind was 
             really more of a beer-swillin', back-slappin' kind of night, 
             if you know what I mean?  You're certainly welcome to join 
             us if you like.
      **Niles:** It sounds interesting.
    **Frasier:** All right. [_opens door to -_] Woody?
      **Woody:** Hey, Dr Crane! [_they hug_]
    **Frasier:** Good to see ya.
      **Woody:** You look great.
    **Frasier:** Well thank you, thanks.  You too.
      **Woody:** Aah, this place is awesome.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
      **Woody:**[_indicating Daphne, Martin and Niles_] I'm not surprised you 
             need all these roommates to help you pay for it.
    **Frasier:** Er, they're not really roommates, Woody.  They're... they're 
             more like boarders actually.  That's my father, Martin.
      **Woody:** Well, hi.  I remember hearing about you, you were a policeman,
             right?
     **Martin:** That's right.
    **Frasier:** And that's my brother right there, Niles.  He's a psychiatrist
             too.
      **Niles:** Hello.
      **Woody:** Oh, wow!
    **Frasier:** And this is Daphne Moon, my father's home health-care worker.
     **Daphne:** It's nice to meet you.
      **Woody:** Oh hi.  I like your accent.  Aah, you're from England, right?
     **Daphne:** Manchester.
      **Woody:** Darn!  I'm usually pretty good at that. [_Eddie bounces in_] 
             Oh hey, who's this little guy?
     **Martin:** I'm not sure I even know anymore.
      **Woody:**[_to Frasier, confidentially_] My dad's getting the same way.
    **Frasier:** So Woody, can I get you a beer?
      **Woody:** That's funny, huh? Y'know, all those years I was waiting on 
             you, and now you're getting me a beer.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, life's like that sometimes, isn't it?  Daphne, get 
             us a couple of beers, will ya? [_Daphne goes to kitchen, not 
             happily_] So, what brings you to Seattle?
      **Woody:** My cousin's getting married.
    **Frasier:** Really?
      **Niles:** Which is your cousin, the bride or the groom?
      **Woody:** Actually, both are.
      **Niles:** I assume they're kissing cousins?
      **Woody:** Ho, they're doing a lot more than that!  That's why they have 
             to get married.
    **Frasier:** So, is Kelly with you?
      **Woody:** No no, she's visiting her mom with the kids, but she sends 
             her love.
    **Frasier:** And how's the old gang?
      **Woody:** Oh well, they haven't changed much.  Sam's doing great, 
             Carla's terrific... oh, y'know, we almost had a wedding.  Mr. 
             Clavin got himself one of those Eastern European mail-order 
             brides, but ah, they lived together for a couple of days, 
             and decided to call it off.
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh.  I'm so sorry for Cliff.
      **Woody:** Yeah.  She said she was homesick.  That Bosnia must be a 
             beautiful place.
    
    [__N.B. Woody Harrelson appeared in the film, "Welcome to Sarajevo."__]
    
    _Daphne comes back with a tray of beers._
    
     **Daphne:** Here we are.
    **Frasier:** Oh thank you, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** That's one for you, one for you, and [_opens can and heads 
             towards Martin. Sits down_] one for me.
    **Frasier:** Well Woody, I thought tonight we would just maybe stay in, 
             y'know, order some pizza?
      **Woody:** Sounds good by me.
    **Frasier:** Okay, great.  I'll just call the place around the corner.  
             Niles you uh, gonna join us?
      **Niles:** Well, why not?  It'll be fun to drink some beer and have some 
             pizza with a couple of rapscallions.
      **Woody:** Oh hey, if you don't mind, could we make that half 
             rapscallions, half pepperoni?
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment, later that night.
    Frasier and Woody are reminiscing, moderately drunk, and can barely 
    speak for laughing._
    
      **Woody:** That wasn't the best prank we played.  You remember that time
             with Mr. Clavin?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes.  And the ferret! [_more laughter; Daphne and Martin 
             look on, obviously not understanding._]
      **Woody:**[_explaining_] He was about to go on his round and we shoved 
             an angry ferret into his mailbag.
      **Niles:** Oh, my.  Exactly, ahh, how do you make a ferret angry?
      **Woody:** Well, for starters, you shove him into a mailbag.
    **Frasier:** God, that was funny.  Do you remember the expression on his 
             face?
      **Woody:** Y'know, I never saw his face.  I was too busy looking at Mr. 
             Clavin.
    **Frasier:** Woody, let me get you another cold one.
      **Woody:** Oh, thanks.
    **Frasier:** My god.  I tell ya, this has just been the best evening.  My 
             God, it's like re-living all my old days at Cheers, only 
             without Lilith.  Boy, that's a trip to Bountiful, let me 
             tell ya. [_goes into kitchen_]
     **Martin:**[_quietly, to Daphne_] These guys are really getting through
             the beers, aren't they?
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes.  If this keeps up, you may have to fish out that 
             emergency can you keep in the toilet tank.
    
    _Frasier comes back with more cans._
    
    **Frasier:** There you are, Woods.
      **Woody:** Well, y'know what, on second thought I think I'm gonna pass.  
             I'm feeling a little bit jet-lagged.
    **Frasier:** Well, all right, you want to call it a night?
      **Woody:** You know, I probably should.  But this was so much fun.  I'd 
             really like to do it again.
    **Frasier:** Well, all right, how about lunch tomorrow?
      **Woody:** Oh yeah, that sounds great.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
      **Woody:** Hey, goodbye y'all, nice to meet you.
     **Martin:** Oh hey, you too.  Come back.
    **Frasier:** You know what, Woody?  There's a new gourmet Mexican 
             restaurant over near your hotel I'd love to try.  It's 
             called "Dos Burros." It sounds _muy delicioso_.
      **Woody:** I didn't know you speak Spanish?
    **Frasier:** Ohh, it's nothing.
      **Woody:** I know ahh, "dos" means two, what does "burro" mean?
    **Frasier:** Same as in English, Jackass.
      **Woody:**[_leaves_] Sorry, just asking.
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE LONG GOODBYE** 
    
    _Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment, next day. 
    He and Woody are back from lunch._
    
     **Martin:** Hey guys, how was lunch?
      **Woody:** Oh, great.  We told one old story, we told a hundred. 
             [_to Eddie_] Hey, how you doin', little guy?
     **Martin:** His name's Eddie.
      **Woody:** Hey, good for you, Mr Crane. [_to Frasier, confidentially_] They
             have good days, and they have bad days.
    **Frasier:** Woody, here's that Seattle guidebook I was telling you about,
             right here.
      **Woody:** Oh, thanks.
    **Frasier:** Take a loan of that, huh?
      **Woody:**[_looking at picture in book_] Wow, look at that view, you can 
             see the whole city.
    **Frasier:** Woody, turn around, it's even better.
    _Woody turns to face the window, but is still looking at the book._
    
      **Woody:** Gosh.  You're right, this is better.
    **Frasier:** No, no Woody, look up.
      **Woody:**[_finally seeing the panorama outside the window_] OHH. 
             [_indicating balcony_] You mind if I go out there?
    **Frasier:** No, no.  You go ahead.
      **Woody:** Remember the time we went out on the balcony of Melville's and
             threw pudding?
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] I don't think I laughed harder in my entire life! 
    
    _Woody goes onto the balcony.  Frasier goes into the kitchen.  
    The laughter stops._
    
    **Frasier:** Put a bullet in my head.
     **Martin:** What's going on?
    **Frasier:** My God.  I have absolutely nothing in common with this man, 
             except things that happened ten years ago.
     **Martin:** But I thought you had a fun time last night.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, yes.  We had exactly the same time this afternoon, 
             it wasn't nearly as fun.  The same stories, and variations 
             thereof, being forced to laugh over and over.  I swear, if 
             I never get another shoulder noogie I will die a happy man.
     **Martin:** Oh, don't feel bad.  You've been a good friend and you've 
             shown him a nice time, and now all that's left is for you to 
             go in there and tell him goodbye.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I guess when all this is over I'll have learned a 
             valuable lesson.  Sometimes you can have too much of a good 
             thing.  You have to know when to say "When."  The past is 
             just that, the past.  You can never go home again.  Less is 
             more.
     **Martin:** Wish you had started with that last one.
    **Frasier:**[_goes into lounge area, where Woody is sitting_] Well, Woods?
             It's been great seeing you. 
      **Woody:** Oh yeah, hey.
    **Frasier:** C'mon, gimme a good hug, ah? [_they hug_] Now you gotta promise
             me you're gonna give my love to everybody back at the bar.
      **Woody:** Oh, I will.
    **Frasier:** Oh, and give that beautiful wife of yours and those two kids a
             kiss from Uncle Frasier.
      **Woody:** You got it.
    **Frasier:** Now don't be a stranger, okay?
      **Woody:** No, I won't, I won't. [_they hug again_] So, [_sitting down_] where
             are we going for dinner tonight?
    
    _End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene Five -- Cafe Nervosa. 
    Frasier enters and meets Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier.  Odd to see you without Woody in tow.  He off 
             teasing ferrets?
    **Frasier:** Niles, listen, uh, I've been having such a great time with 
             Woody, I was wondering, y'know, maybe tonight you'd like to 
             join us?  We've planned to go out...
      **Niles:**[_interrupting_] You can save it.  Dad brought me up to speed 
             with your reunion of the damned. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, God.
      **Niles:** I would love to help, I'm sorry, you're on your own.
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, please, Niles, really, I'm desperate.  Do you 
             have any idea how difficult it is to feign interest in the 
             same old stories over and over again?
      **Niles:** And you call yourself a psychiatrist?  You wouldn't last a 
             week in private practice.
    **Frasier:** Ooh.
      **Niles:** Speaking of which, my six o'clock is waiting.
     **Waiter:**[_handing Niles a coffee carton_] Triple espresso to go.
      **Niles:** Thank you. [_leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Niles?  Please?  Please, I need you.  It's going to be an 
             excruciating journey into... Ohh... [_notices Roz is standing 
             beside him_] Roz!  Hey, you know what, are you up for a night 
             on the town?
        **Roz:** This wouldn't be the invitation that Niles just blew off, 
             would it?
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right!  Here, please. [_they sit_] My old friend Woody
             is dragging me out again tonight.  I could really use a 
             buffer.
             He's taking me to some God-awful karaoke bar.
        **Roz:** Are you gonna sing?
    **Frasier:** No!
        **Roz:** Okay, I'll go.
    **Frasier:** Really, you will?
        **Roz:** I had a babysitter tonight, my plans fell through, karaoke 
             might be fun.
    
    _Gil Chesterton walks into the cafe, just in time to hear the word-_
    
        **Gil:** Karaoke?  Tonight?  Oh, I'd love to.
    **Frasier:** Well Gil, I'm not sure you'd enjoy this.
        **Gil:** Oh nonsense.  If we're going to the one on Pike, I keep a 
             locker there where I store my own microphone and show jackets.
    
    [_N.B. Notice Edward Hibbert's tan; he has just returned from shooting 
    the pilot for the short-lived remake of "Fantasy Island."_]
    
    _Noel enters._
    
       **Noel:** Hey, guys.  Hi, Roz.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Noel.
       **Noel:**[_to Roz_] I see you're at... our table.
        **Gil:** "Our table"?  Ooh, is there an office romance brewing?
        **Roz:** No, Gil.  We're just friends, right Noel?
       **Noel:**[_fingers crossed_] So far.
        **Gil:**[_to Noel_] Well, who knows what the night has in store?  
             We're all going for karaoke.  Why don't you join us?
       **Noel:** Count me in.
        **Roz:**[_panicking_] Is that my beeper?
    **Frasier:**[_knowing she's about to bail on him_] I didn't hear anything.
        **Roz:** Oh my God!
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:** It's the babysitter, she only calls in an emergency.  I have 
             to go, bye! [_she exits, quickly_] TAXI!!
    **Frasier:** Roz, wait!
       **Noel:** Roz, wait!
        **Gil:** Well, looks as it's just us boys.
    
    _Frasier tries to smile through the tears.

    Daphne, Martin and Niles have just finished watching a movie.  
    Music is playing over the credits._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, that was beautiful.
     **Martin:** Yeah.  You know Niles, that was the first movie I ever took 
             your mother to see.  I deliberately picked a tear jerker so 
             I'd be there to comfort her.  At the first sniffle, I was on 
             her like an octopus.
     **Daphne:** You men.  You always find a way to make us more vulnerable to 
             your clumsy advances.  Ooh, that wine went straight to my 
             head.
      **Niles:**[_refilling her glass_] Let's kill off the bottle, shall we? 
             [_he keeps on pouring until it's full to the brim_]
    
    _Frasier enters, or rather, stumbles in._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Turn off the music.
     **Martin:** Oh.  Well, we were just...
    **Frasier:** Dad.  I never want to hear music again.
    
    _Martin turns the TV off._
    
      **Niles:** Oh.  I take it you had a whizz-bang time at the karaoke bar?
    **Frasier:** For starters, Woody sang "What Kind Of Fool Am I?"  Quickly 
             turned into an audience participation number.  Then Gil and 
             Noel did a charming duet with "Anything You Can Do, I Can Do 
             Better."  They were both wrong.  I guess the highlight of 
             the evening was when Gil, after one too many Que Royales, 
             performed a haunting rendition of "I Feel Pretty," during 
             the latter verses of which Noel joined him on the apron of 
             the stage and translated... into Klingon. [_he buries his head 
             in his hands_] Well, I think I'm just gonna go off to bed so 
             I can get up bright and early for my harbour cruise with Woody 
             tomorrow.
     **Martin:** What?!  You're seeing him again?  Why don't you tell the guy 
             you're busy for once?
    **Frasier:** Dad, he knows that I'm not.  Besides, I'd hate to hurt his 
             feelings, I'd hate to have him think I've outgrown him.
      **Niles:** But you have.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's the problem.  I've moved on to bigger and better 
             things in my life, he's still pouring drinks back in the same 
             bar he's been at for the last fifteen years.  Don't you think 
             that's kinda sad?
     **Martin:** If I were you I'd just lie to him.  Tell him you have to work, 
             or you met a pretty girl.
    
    _Daphne, having almost worked her way through her full glass of wine, 
    suddenly bursts into song._
    
     **Daphne:** Who's that pretty girl in the mirror there?
             What mirror, where?
             Who could that attractive girl be?
             Which, what, where, who?
             Who?
     **Martin:** Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Who?
     **Martin:** Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Wh..
    **Frasier:**_DAPHNE!!!_
     **Martin:** Bedtime.
     **Daphne:** I used to be with a light opera works.
    **Frasier:** Yes, fine, and I used to be a fan dancer!  Get out.  Go to bed!
    
    _Daphne leaves._
    
    [__N.B. Daphne's song is from "West Side Story."__]
    
      **Niles:** She uh, seems a little wobbly, [_moves to follow her_] perhaps 
             I should...
    **Frasier:** Niles.
    
    _The doorbell bing-bongs.  Niles looks through the peephole._
    
      **Niles:** Ooh, surprise, guess who?
    **Frasier:** Dear God!  I just left him.  What moonlit berry-picking 
             expedition does he have planned for me now?
      **Niles:**[_worried that Woody might hear him_] Shhh.
    **Frasier:** I can't take this anymore.  All right, all right fine.  I'm 
             just going to have to lie to him. [_opens door_] Woody!
      **Woody:** Hey, Dr Crane.  Hey, everybody.  Listen, I... when I 
             got back to my hotel I called Kelly to say goodnight, and 
             uh... it turns out our little girl has an ear infection, 
             so I'm taking the Redeye right now and my cab is waiting 
             for me downstairs.
    **Frasier:**[_concerned_] Oh well, Woody.  I guess this means goodbye, then.
      **Woody:** Yeah, I'm afraid so.
    **Frasier:** All right then, give me a hug.  You remember to give my love 
             to the folks back at Cheers.
      **Woody:** Oh, will do.
    **Frasier:** Okay.  I hope that little girl of yours gets better real soon.
      **Woody:** Thank you.  It was great spending time with you.
    **Frasier:** Well, it was great seeing you too, Woody.
      **Woody:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** It's a shame we have to cut it short.
      **Woody:** It sure is.  Well, goodbye. [_leaves as the others say farewell_]
    **Frasier:** Goodbye, Wood. [_closes door_] God bless the virus that invaded
             that little girl's ear canal.
      **Niles:** Congratulations.  I'll be off.
    **Frasier:** Oh no.  Niles, I'll tell you what, to celebrate my newfound
             freedom, why don't we go over to that little cantina I 
             mentioned to you earlier, and I'll buy you a late supper?  
             We'll have a margarita. 
      **Niles:** Thank you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** And after that, we'll go by that pricey new cigar club, it's 
             my treat.
      **Niles:** Well hey, big spender.
    **Frasier:**[_cringing_] Ohh...
      **Niles:** Is everything all right?
    **Frasier:** The last time I heard that phrase, Gil was belting it out 
             while sitting on the lap of a Japanese businessman.  Let's 
             get that margarita. [_they leave_]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Dos Burros, a Mexican restaurant. 
    Frasier and Niles have just been seated.  The waiter gives them their menus._
    
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** I think you'll like this place.
      **Niles:** Well, I do already.  N.M.B.
    **Frasier:** N.M.B?
      **Niles:** No Mariachi Band.
    **Frasier:**[_seeing a certain someone seated at the bar_] Oh dear God.  
             Quick, hide your face with your menu.  Woody's over there.  
             If he sees us he'll know I lied.
      **Niles:** When did you lie?
    **Frasier:** I told him I was going out of town.
      **Niles:** No, you didn't.  He told you he was going out of town.
    **Frasier:** That's right.  He lied.  He should be hiding. [_calls_] Woody?  
             Woody?
    
    _Woody picks up a menu to hide behind, and furtively walks into the restroom._ 
    
    **Frasier:** For God's sake.  Stay here. [_he goes over to the restroom 
             door only to find it locked_] Woody.  Come out of there, 
             please.
      **Woody:**[_from behind the door_] _No hablo ingles._
    **Frasier:** I don't understand this.
      **Woody:** It means I don't speak English.
    **Frasier:** Will you just come out here? [_Woody comes out_] Woody?  What 
             is going on?
      **Woody:** I can't even look at you.  I'm so ashamed.  I... I lied to 
             you, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Why did you do that?
      **Woody:** Well, I guess I didn't want you to know it was me in the 
             bathroom.
    **Frasier:** No, Woody.  Earlier this evening you told me you were going 
             back to Boston.
      **Woody:** Oh, well.  I feel terrible saying this but, I just couldn't 
             face another day of us hanging out together.
    **Frasier:** What, you weren't enjoying our time together?
      **Woody:** No, I... I had a great time that first night, but after that, 
             I don't know, you were still having a good time, but ahhh, 
             it was less and less fun for me.
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] This is too funny.
      **Woody:** See, you're still having a good time and I'm miserable.
    **Frasier:** Why didn't you say something?
      **Woody:** Well, I don't know, I didn't want to hurt your feelings.  
             To tell you the truth, I felt kinda bad for ya.
    **Frasier:** You felt bad for me?
      **Woody:** Well no offense, but look at your life.  You live with your 
             dad, you hang out with your brother, you have no plans.  And 
             let's face it, those karaoke friends of yours, I wouldn't 
             want to be stranded on a desert island with them.  Well, 
             maybe that English guy, he's a good entertainer.
    **Frasier:** Really Woody, there's nothing to worry about.  I know my life 
             may seem rather dreary to you but ah, it's really quite 
             enjoyable.  In fact, it's even a lot of fun.  I love my life 
             now, honestly.  You know what, I wouldn't trade my years at 
             Cheers for anything, but I am very happy with my life the 
             way it is today.
      **Woody:**[_incredulous_] You mean it?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  That's what makes this conversation so ironic.  You see, 
             you see my life as some sort of middle-aged compromise and, 
             well just the other day I was thinking about your life.  And 
             all I could think was...
      **Woody:** What?
    
    _Frasier pauses, knowing that telling Woody exactly what he thinks 
    won't help anyone.  He then realizes another truth._
    
    **Frasier:** How lucky you are.  You see, you've found where you belong 
             and you've made your home there.  I guess for some of us it 
             just takes longer than others.
      **Woody:**[_relaxing_] I just stopped in for a beer...
    **Frasier:** Well, you know what, Niles will be on the phone for a couple 
             of more minutes, why don't we have one last drink together, 
             huh?
      **Woody:** That'd be nice.
    **Frasier:** Okay.  Barkeep, a couple of beers here, please?
      **Woody:** You know, I meant what I said.  I had a great time hanging out 
             with you.  That first night.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.
      **Woody:** Maybe we could do it again, in five or ten years.
    **Frasier:** Absolutely.  Ten years it is.
    _Woody clinks his mug against Frasier's._
      **Woody:** Cheers.
    **Frasier:** Cheers.
    
    _End of Act Two._
