From under the piano a hand raises a second glass, and Frasier fills that as well.  Frasier picks up his book and goes to his room, saying good night to Niles, who is slumped under the piano, miserably sipping sherry.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Special Guest Star** SAUL RUBINEK as Donny Douglass  **Guest Starring** ALOMA WRIGHT as Maria PAUL CUSIMANO as Waiter  * * *  ## Summary {kathy churay}     _Kathy Churay has written an episode summary which she has allowed me to use on this site. See the transcription for more infomation.  ACT ONE  SCENE 1 - Cafe Nervosa_  Roz is showing Frasier pictures as Niles enters to reports that Maris's lawyers are trying to prolong his torture by putting off the court date by another 8 months.  Frasier asks how Niles's lawyers responded, and Niles says they got it cut down to 7 months.  Frasier says it's time to consider a new lawyer, and Roz suggests her old boyfriend, Donny Douglas. Frasier is enthused -- \"He's the one they call The Piranha, right?\" Frasier's argument is proven when he discovers that Niles is now packing his own lunch, while the lawyers are putting their lunches on Niles's legal bill.   Frasier and Niles show up at Donny's office.  Niles is full of snobbery over the office decor, Donny's degree from a less than prestigious law school, etc.  Donny comes in wearing sweats, fresh from a workout.  He's in a rush and is due in court in 20 minutes. He encourages Niles to tell him the facts of the divorce, but as Niles attempts to do so, Donny begins to take off his clothes to change for court.  Niles tries to continue but is understandably distracted by Donny's eating his lunch, taking his clothes off, etc. Niles is ready to walk out when Donny decided to get on the phone with Niles' lawyers, and in short order browbeats them into setting a court date one month away.  Very impressed, Niles agrees that Donny should represent him.  As they depart Donny tells them he will contact them soon to prepare them for pre-trial depositions, just a casual dinner or something to discuss the questions that will be asked.   Donny, Frasier, Niles, Martin and Daphne are having coffee and discussing the testimony Frasier will give in his deposition the next morning. [Frasier has great difficulty being brief, as we all know.] Martin asks why Maris's lawyers want to depose Frasier before Niles, and Donny explains that they will want to find out as much dirt as possible from the friends and family before taking Niles' deposition, so they know what questions to ask Niles.  Donny continues to go over the questions Maris's lawyers will ask Frasier.  He asks whether Frasier ever noticed Niles throwing money around during the separation.  Frasier says yes, and Donny corrects him. \"No, no!  Your answer will be, 'Not to the best of my recollection.'\" Frasier protests that he can't give that answer because it's untruthful and a violation of his ethics, and Niles agrees with him.  Donny is exasperated and goes to the phone to check with his office for messages.  To his disgust he learns from his secretary that Maris's lawyers are making yet another desperate, outlandish accusation -- alienation of affection.  Maris is alleging that Niles was in love with Daphne during the marriage.  Niles is shocked  but looks almost happy to hear the secret out at last. Daphne is completely disgusted at the low-down lawyer tactics and asks Frasier, \"Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?\" Frasier replies uncomfortably, \"Not to the best of my recollection!\"   _ACT TWO  SCENE 1 - Frasier's living room - continuation of previous scene_  Daphne asks why Maris's lawyers have such a ridiculous idea about her and Niles.  Donny replies that she and Niles had apparently caused quite a stir at a country club dance a few years back.  Daphne protests that it was all for the benefit of Niles' snobby friends, but Donny tells her the lawyers will subpoena Daphne to give a deposition about it anyway. Daphne replies bravely that she is ready, and in fact will give her deposition the next morning right after Frasier.  \"Don't you worry, Dr. Crane!\" she tells Niles stoutly.  She departs with Donny to his office, where he will prepare her for the questions she will be asked.  After their departure Niles is distraught because he believes he has just lost the divorce case.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ",

        "text": "\"Well, he'll just say no.  Right, Frasier?\"  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  But Frasier can't give Martin the answer he wants, and the two get into a bitter argument over Frasier's ethics versus his loyalty to his brother. Martin argues the divorce was due to Maris's behavior, not Niles' feelings for Daphne which have nothing to do with the case.  But Frasier argues that, \"Ethics are what we do when no one else is looking.  I learned that from you!\"  Meanwhile, Niles regresses to his childhood and retreats under the piano to hide.   Frasier is waiting tensely to be called for his deposition when Niles unexpectedly shows up.  He tells Frasier he plans to admit everything to Donny, and in fact is having doubts that perhaps his feelings for Daphne did contribute to the breakup of the marriage.  Frasier sternly reminds Niles that he did everything he could to save the marriage and has nothing to reproach himself for.  Niles is grateful for the reassurance and as Donny comes in, Frasier departs to the conference room for his deposition.  Donny says he's glad to see Niles alone for a moment, because he has discovered Niles has been less than truthful with him.  Niles apologizes and is about to admit the truth about Daphne when Donny reveals that the new information he's discovered is not about Daphne. It seems that Maris's family money didn't come from the sale of timber, as she's told Niles and everyone else in Seattle society.  Baffled, Niles takes the file Donny hands him and reads with growing delight.  \"Urinal cakes?\" he marvels.  A smiling Donny replies, \"I believe we now have what's known as a bargaining chip.\" Donny starts out of the office to reveal the new information to Maris's lawyers, but Niles stops him.   \"There's some news you want to deliver yourself!\"   Making himself comfortable in Donny's desk chair and propping his feet on the desk, Niles gloats as he dials Maris.   Niles and Frasier enter the cafe, Niles elated over the large settlement he's gotten from Maris.  \"I'll be able to get my whole life back -- my apartment, my car....  And to think I owe it all to one amazing man.\"  Niles continues to rhapsodize about Donny as, behind his back, Donny and Daphne enter the cafe.  They sit down at a table very obviously affectionate with each other.   A downhearted Frasier points this out to Niles, who abruptly falls silent as they move to the window table to greet Daphne and Donny.  Daphne tells Niles, \"Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so happy for you.\"  Niles puts on a cheerful face as Donny and Daphne reveal that they're dating.  They seem genuinely happy with one another.  Donny is obviously infatuated as he leans and sniffs Daphne's hair. \"Mmm, that scent is wonderful.  What is that?\"  As Niles turns away he  answers quietly to Frasier, \"Cherry bark and almonds.\"   The brothers return to their table and Niles sinks sadly into his chair with Frasier's hand on his shoulder.
