    _Act 1_
    **A NIGHT AT THE THEATRE**
    _Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Martin is sitting in his chair, Frasier comes in from the 
    bedrooms._
    **Frasier:** Well, I better be heading out.  Niles and I are meeting for 
             dinner, and then we have tickets to the theatrical event of 
             the season.
     **Martin:** Oh, really?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Sir Trevor Aimsley in "Tears of the Mariner."
     **Martin:** Oh.
    **Frasier:** It promises to be a very exciting evening.  You see, Seattle 
             is Sir Trevor's last stop on his farewell tour.  After this, 
             he's retiring from the stage forever.
     **Martin:** "Tears of the Mariner."  You know, I think I read a review 
             of that.  Thought it was one of those baseball stories like 
             "Pride of the Yankees", you know?  But it's just about some 
             crabby old sailor, stuck in this little town...
    **Frasier:** No, no, Dad, please.  I have carefully avoided all the reviews 
             of this play.  I do not want to hear about it before I see it.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't want to hear about it after you see it.
    _Frasier opens the door, Daphne is there with her keys out._
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello Daphne.
     **Martin:** Hey, Daph.
     **Daphne:** That's it?  "Hello Daphne"?  Haven't you seen the paper?
     **Martin:** Well, I glanced at it.  Why, did I miss something?
    _Opens the paper to the back page and gives it to him._
     **Daphne:** Look!
     **Martin:**[_laughing_] Oh, my gosh!  Is that you?
     **Daphne:** Yes!
    **Frasier:** Well, good heavens, it's kind of hard to tell.  You've got 
             your back turned to the camera, your skirts blown up around          
             your... Oh, well, it must've been rather blustery out. 
     **Daphne:** I was in the park yesterday, and this photographer snapped 
             my picture for the "It's Your Seattle" column - the one where 
             they show some average person out and about, then use their 
             name on the column.  For instance, if they used a picture of 
             Mr. Crane, the caption would read "Martin Crane's Seattle."  
             Or if they took one of you it would say "Frasier Crane's 
             Se-"
    **Frasier:** Yes, we get it.
     **Daphne:** Well, don't crinkle it, I want to send it home to my family.
     **Martin:** You sure about that?
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't be such an old fogey.  So I'm bending down and me 
             knickers are showing a bit, but my family'll still be proud 
             as peacocks when they see that:  "Daphne Moon's Seattle".
    _Martin and Frasier share a smile._
    **Frasier:** She certainly does.
    _He heads for the door.  Fade out.
    
    Scene 2 - In Front of the Theater
    Fade in.  Frasier and Niles approach the entrance, sipping coffee._
    **Frasier:** Niles, will you just stop it?  The dinner was just fine.
      **Niles:** It was not fine.  I made those reservations weeks ago.  
             They seated us so close to the kitchen I'm surprised they 
             didn't make us wear hair nets.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure it was just a mix-up.
      **Niles:** It's not a mix-up.  It's part of an alarming trend I've 
             noticed ever since Maris and I parted company.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Last week, Roberta Phipps snubbed me at the opera.  
             I wasn't even invited to that gala fundrasier for 
             St. Andrew's Orphanage.
    **Frasier:** You can still send money to the children.
      **Niles:** As usual, you've missed the point.  I'm being shut out.  
             It's as if someone snuck into my world and changed all the 
             locks.
    _They throw their cups away._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles. [_pulling out the tickets_] Well, at least you don't 
             have to worry about that tonight.  After you.
      **Niles:** Evening.
      **Usher:** Tickets, please.
    _They give them over._
      **Usher:** Oh, I'm sorry sir, these aren't for this performance.
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** What?  But they say for the sixteenth, that's the sixteenth 
             right there, that's today.
      **Usher:** Yes sir, they were for the matinee.
      **Niles:** Oh, no, no there has to be some mistake, let me just...  
             Oh, dear God.
    **Frasier:** I'm so sorry, Niles.
      **Niles:** Well, surely you must hold some tickets aside for 
             emergencies.  We'll take anything, anything at all.
    **Frasier:** Yes, even mezzanine.
      **Usher:** If you like, you can try your luck in the cancellation line.
      **Niles:** How could this happen?  I have to see this play.  I have to 
             have people see me see this play.  If I'm not seen seeing 
             this play, you see...
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, Niles!  I will make a simple phone call and 
             we'll get house seats for tomorrow night, all right?
    _The two walk past the cancellation line._
      **Niles:** I suppose so.  Come on, let's go.  The last thing I need is 
             for someone to see us loitering out here like gutter riff-
             raff pathetically scrounging for last minute tickets.
    _The people in the cancellation line are not really happy with this 
    description and Frasier notices them._
    **Frasier:** Good luck!
    _FADE TO:_
    **ANOTHER NIGHT AT THE THEATRE**
    _Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment
    The doorbell rings.
    
    Fade in.  Frasier answers the door to reveal Niles._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, I know I'm a bit early, I was hoping we could get a 
             bite to eat before the theater.
    **Frasier:** Actually, Niles...
      **Niles:** Yeah, yeah, it'll be on me of course, as a thank you for 
             getting those replacement tickets.
    **Frasier:** Yes, about the tickets...
      **Niles:** I know, I owe you money.  And my gratitude.  And if I keep 
             talking, you won't be able to tell me you weren't able to 
             get the tickets.
    **Frasier:** Just haven't been able to get them yet...
      **Niles:** Oh, I KNEW you wouldn't get them!
    **Frasier:** Niles, please.
      **Niles:** Oh, and now it's too late.  It's six o'clock.
    **Frasier:** Please, just calm down.  I've made a few well placed calls, 
             I haven't heard back from a couple of people.  Someone will 
             call.
      **Niles:** Well, someone better call.  Because everyone who's anyone 
             is seeing this play.  And you know who you are if you're 
             not anyone?  You're NO ONE.  And I've been someone much too 
             long to start being no one now.
    _Martin comes in from the bedrooms._
     **Martin:** Oh, hey, I thought no one was here. [_Niles begins to throw 
             another fit_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, please, just relax.  One way or another, we are 
             going to get tickets to this play.
     **Martin:** You two still going on about those tickets?  If this play 
             is any good at all, in a coupla years they'll do it down at 
             the dinner theater and you can get a nice prime rib with it.
    _Niles and Frasier are shocked and stand with their mouths agape in 
    their classic "Did he actually SAY that?" look._
    **Frasier:** Dad, you don't understand.  You see, this isn't just about 
             the play.  This is literally our last opportunity to see 
             one of the finest actors of our time.
     **Martin:** You just want to go 'cause all your snobby friends are goin' 
             and you don't want to feel left out.
      **Niles:** What we want is to sit at a theater and share a transcendent 
             experience.
     **Martin:** That nobody else could get tickets to.
    **Frasier:** Of course.  That's the transcendent part.
    _Frasier and Martin share a smile at this.  The phone rings, Niles 
    eagerly picks it up and hands it to Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Hello? ... Yes, I'll hold. [_to Niles_] It's Cleo Fenwick.
      **Niles:** Cleo Fenwick?
    **Frasier:** Yes, you remember her, she's on the board of the theater.  
             You've seen her: bad eye-job, dowager's hump you could           
             cross the Sahara on. [_into phone_] Hello, Cleo, you lovely 
             thing.  Uh-huh.  Oh, well, you're a dear for trying.  Thanks.  
             Oh, don't despair Niles, I'm getting another call.  Hello?  
             Yes, Dora!  Yes, uh-huh.  Too bad.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, 
             oh, that is a wonderful idea, yes I will!  Thank you, bye-bye. 
             [_He disconnects._]
      **Niles:** She has a lead for us?
    **Frasier:** Yes, she said I should call Cleo Fenwick.
      **Niles:** This is hopeless.
    **Frasier:** Niles, there is another way.
      **Niles:** You don't mean...
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I know it's a calculated risk.  It is a little uncertain.
    _Martin gets up and heads for the kitchen._
      **Niles:** You can't be serious.  It's unthinkable.
    **Frasier:** Niles, what other choice do we have?
      **Niles:** But the indignity, it reeks of desperation.
     **Martin:** Now, now, before you do anything desperate, at least go 
             stand in the cancellation line. [_exits to kitchen_]
    _Frasier and Niles look at each other dumbfounded._
      **Niles:** What did he think we were talking about?
    _Frasier shrugs, just as confused.  Fade out.
    
    Scene 4 - In Front of the Theater
    Fade in.  Niles and Frasier are at the head of the cancellation line._
      **Niles:** Oh no it's Stephen and Susan Kendall.  Quick, turn around.  
             If they see us here, we'll be ruined.  They know everybody.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know.  Their Sunday brunches are a Who's Who of 
             Seattle's elite.
      **Niles:**[_glancing over his shoulder_] I think it's safe.  No one 
             saw us.
        **Roz:**[_calling out and hurrying over_] Hey, Frasier!  Niles!
    **Frasier:** Roz.  What are you doing here?
      **Niles:** And how did you get tickets?
        **Roz:** Oh, a friend of mine couldn't use hers, so she gave them to 
             me.  I asked my cute new dentist, he's a big fan of Sir 
             What's-his-face.
    **Frasier:** You refer to the world's greatest living actor as...
      **Niles:** Now, now, Frasier.  Roz may not be familiar with Sir Trevor, 
             but I'm sure she'll enjoy the play.  I trust you got good 
             seats?
        **Roz:**[_taking the tickets out to check_] Ooh. I think so.  Row C?
      **Niles:** Row C.  Excellent. [_then_] Look, a whole bunch of naked men.
    _Roz turns around and Niles grabs the tickets in her hand but she 
    doesn't let go._
        **Roz:** What are you doing?
      **Niles:** Give me those, you philistine!  You don't even know his name!
        **Roz:** Are you crazy?!
    _She kicks him in the shin, causing him to yelp "Ouch!" and let go of 
    the tickets.  Roz's date walks up._
        **Rob:** Ready to go, Roz?
        **Roz:** Yes.
      **Niles:** Dr. Mandell?
        **Rob:** Oh, hi, Niles.
        **Roz:** You two know each other?
        **Rob:** Sure.  How's the teeth bleaching going?
    _Both Roz and Frasier look very smugly at Niles upon hearing this._
      **Niles:**[_folding his lips over his teeth_] Fine, thanks.
        **Roz:** Let's go, Rob.  It's a long way to row C from the cancellation 
             line. [_She heads for the entrance._]
        **Rob:** Hang in there, guys.  I wouldn't be surprised if you get 
             lucky.
      **Niles:** I'd be stupefied if you didn't.
    _Rob looks confused for a moment, then follows Roz._
    **Frasier:** I knew you were bleaching them.
      **Niles:** Oh...
    **Frasier:** "No, really, I just changed toothpastes."
      **Susan:** Is that Niles Crane?  And Frasier.
    _The Kendalls come over._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Susan.
      **Niles:** Stephen.
      **Susan:** We're seeing everybody tonight.  It simply... oh, dear.  
             You're not waiting for a cancellation, are you?
      **Niles:** Is that what this is?
    **Frasier:** I feel just... Look at us.  Blocking these poor unfortunates 
             who couldn't get tickets.
     **Seller:** I got one pair left.  Who's next? 
      **Usher:** Curtain going up.
    **Frasier:**[_ushering the Kendalls along_] Curtain going up, shall we?
     **Seller:** Next in line, please.
      **Susan:** Niles, you coming?
      **Niles:** I, uh...
    **Frasier:** You'll have to forgive my brother.  You see, he's too ashamed 
             to admit he's just waiting for one last cigarette.  It's all 
             right, Niles, you go right ahead, I'll just see the Kendalls 
             in.
      **Niles:** OK.
    **Stephen:** Thank God, another smoker.  Darling, maybe I'll just stay 
             and have a cigarette with Niles.
     **Seller:** Do you want these tickets, sir?
      **Niles:** Me?  Oh, oh, no, no! [_He steps aside for the next people 
             in line._]
      **Susan:** Stephen, please.  I'd really like to sit down.
    **Stephen:** All right.  Niles, we'll make a date.  I'll meet you right 
             here at intermission and we'll have a smoke.
      **Niles:** Oh, right here is where I'll be.
    **Frasier:** Enjoy.
      **Susan:** See you later.
    _The Kendalls go into the theater._
    **Frasier:** Well, this is just perfect.  Not only are we missing the play, 
             but now we have to hang around here until intermission, so 
             they don't catch on to us.
      **Niles:** Oh, what are you complaining about?  I'm the one who has an 
             hour to learn how to smoke.
    
    _End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - In Front of the Theater
    Frasier is sitting on a light post base.  Niles has a cigarette out.  
    The theater starts emptying for intermission._
    **Frasier:** Niles!  They're coming out.  Come on, let's blend in.
    _He notices Niles trying a variety of ways to hold the cigarette._
    **Frasier:** Niles, what are you doing?
      **Niles:** I'm practicing.  I haven't held a cigarette since I played 
             Duke Mantee in our junior high production of "The Petrified 
             Forest."
    **Frasier:** Yes, I remember watching you from the petrified audience.  
             Come on.  Oh, there they are, let's go.
    _They walk over to the Kendall's._
    **Stephen:** Oh, well, you got out here quickly.  I guess you needed one 
             of these more than I did, huh?
      **Niles:** Yes, well, when you enjoy smoking as much as I do, noth... 
             [_Having taken a puff, he breaks down coughing._]
      **Susan:** Oh, bye-bye.  Feel better, I'll call you.
    **Stephen:** The Gornleys.  Kendra isn't feeling well, Richard is taking 
             her home.  Oh, there's Mikki and Lyle.
      **Susan:** Poor old dears, they could only get balcony.
    **Stephen:** Still, we should say hello.  They are your parents.  Excuse 
             us.
    _They walk off._
      **Niles:**[_crushing out his cigarette_] My God, these things are 
             turning me green!
    **Frasier:** Never mind that, Niles.  The Gornleys are not coming back.  
             Let's go sneak into their seats and watch the second act.
      **Niles:** Let's go!
    _They rush to the entrance, but are stopped by the usher._
      **Usher:** Your ticket stubs, please.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I beg your pardon?
      **Usher:** Well, I'm sorry, we've had some people try to sneak in 
             after intermission.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I think we, I left our coats in our seats 
             and our stubs are in the coats.
      **Usher:** Oh, don't worry about it. [_They turn to head in, but are 
             stopped again._] We'll just have someone bring your coats 
             to you.  Where are your seats?
    **Frasier:** I'll...have to check the seating chart.
    _Heading back out, they run into the Kendalls._
    **Stephen:** Aren't you going in?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes, yes, my brother just needed to have one last 
             cigarette.
      **Susan:** Oh, you're worse than Stephen.
    **Frasier:** Yes, really, Niles, I do wish you'd quit.  I'm begging you.
      **Niles:** I just wish I didn't love the damn things so much. [_He lights 
             up._]
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, if we don't see you after, have a lovely evening.
      **Susan:** Actually, we're having a small supper at Le Chanteuse 
             afterwards for Sir Trevor.  So if you're not busy, say 
             around eleven?
    _Niles, choking on his cigarette, desperately nods._
      **Susan:** Good, we'll see you then.
      **Niles:**[_stamping out the cigarette_] Frasier!  Dinner with Sir Trevor, 
             that's better than seeing the play!
    **Frasier:** Niles, are you insane?  We know absolutely nothing about 
             the damn play!  How can we possibly talk with this man?  
             For God's sake, I just wish I'd read that review in 
             yesterday's paper.
      **Niles:** Do you still have it?
    **Frasier:** I might.  Dad lets the papers pile up for days sometimes.  
             You know what?  We've got just enough time to go there and 
             get back.  Let's go!
    _They start to walk away, but Stephen calls out._
    **Stephen:** Where are you going?
    **Frasier:** See, I told you it was the other way.
    _They come up behind the Kendalls, then rush away as soon as their 
    backs are turned._
    **Frasier:**[_muttering_] God!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment
    Frasier and Niles are in the kitchen, rummaging through the papers.  
    Martin comes in._
     **Martin:** What's goin' on?
    **Frasier:** Dad, we're looking for yesterday's paper.
     **Martin:** Oh, well, it should be there.
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad!  That review you were reading yesterday, "Tears of 
             the Mariner."  Do you remember it?
     **Martin:**[_unsure_] Kinda.
    **Frasier:** Just concentrate: What was the play about?
     **Martin:** Well, let me see, uh, it started out with this old guy who 
             was guttin' a fish.  And then he gives this fish to his 
             son, but his son rejects it. 
    **Frasier:** Good!  Good, then what?
     **Martin:** Uh...oh, yeah!  Well, then it turns out he's got this 
             fatal disease, and the next thing you know, he's in this 
             big stadium.  And he's telling everyone that even though 
             he's dying, that today, he considers himself the luckiest...
    **Frasier:** Dad!  That is "Pride of the Yankees"!
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, that's right.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.  
             But I'm pretty sure that fish part was right.
      **Niles:** Yes, yes!  Here it is!
    **Frasier:** Let me see:  "Trevor Aimsley's bravura performance in 'Tears 
             of the Mariner' qualifies him as an..."  Yes, blah blah blah, 
             blah blah blah, continued on page A-sixteen.
    _He flips to the back of the section and opens it up, only to find 
    that there is a huge hole cut in the page._
      **Niles:** Where is it?
    **Frasier:** Daphne!  Her picture must have been on the other side.  It 
             may still be here, she was going to mail it to her mother.  
             [_He heads to the living room._]
      **Niles:**[_following_] Daphne's picture was in the paper?
    **Frasier:** Yes, well someone snapped a candid photo of her in the park.  
             If you ask me, it was not her most flattering angle, but I'm 
             sure you would disagree. [_He grabs Daphne's letter._]
      **Niles:** Well, open it.
    **Frasier:** Carefully... Oh, what the hell, I'll buy her flowers.
    _He rips it open and starts to pull out the piece of newspaper.  
    Daphne comes in the front door and Frasier freezes._
     **Daphne:** Hey, Dr. Crane, I thought you went... Is that my letter?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, let me explain...
     **Daphne:**[_grabbing the letter_] No, no, I should have known I'd 
             never get any privacy in this house.
    **Frasier:** You don't understand.  I just wanted to...
     **Daphne:** You just wanted to find out if I was gossiping about you to 
             my mum.  Well, fine!  I was.  A seventy-three year old woman 
             in Manchester is about to find out that you dye the grey out 
             of your temples.  There!  You happy?
    **Frasier:** No, I am not happy, I am mortified! [_he pauses_] How did you 
             know that?  I keep my hair dye in the false bottom of my 
             cufflink box.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well...  I'll let it go this time. 
    _She nervously heads for her room._
    **Frasier:** Oh, we haven't got time for this!  We've to get down to 
             that party!
    _They head for the door._
      **Niles:** I knew you were dyeing your hair.
    **Frasier:** Shut up.
      **Niles:** "No, no, really, it's just my new conditioner."
    **Frasier:** Shut up!
    _They exit.  Fade out.
    
    Scene 3 - The Restaurant
    Fade in.  Frasier and Niles are sitting at the bar._
    **Frasier:** Whatever you do, don't get specific about the play.  That's 
             the mistake you made last year when you lied about having 
             seen "The Silent Echo."  All that yammering on about how 
             the play had third act problems.  It fooled no one.
      **Niles:** What makes you so sure?
    **Frasier:** Well, for starters, "The Silent Echo" doesn't have a third 
             act.
    _Sir Trevor Aimsley enters to applause and cries of "Bravo!"  He bows 
    and heads towards the bar._
       **Trevor:** Thank you. [_then_] God, I need a drink. [_to bartender_] 
               Double scotch, no ice.
    **Bartender:** Yes, sir.
    _Susan walks up beside Sir Trevor._
      **Susan:** Frasier, Niles, how nice.  Sir Trevor, this is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane and his brother Dr. Niles Crane.
    **Frasier:**[_shaking his hand_] It's an honor.
      **Susan:** Two of our city's preeminent psychiatrists.
      **Niles:**[_shaking his hand_] Huge fans.
    **Frasier:** Huge, yes. 
      **Susan:** They've set up a table for us in the private room, shall we?
     **Trevor:** No, I'll just finish this and be right along.  Perhaps the 
             two doctors will keep me company.  I'd love to hear a 
             psychological interpretation of the play.
      **Susan:** All right, but don't be too long. [_She leaves._]
     **Trevor:** So, tell me, as students of the human psyche, did my character 
             ring true?
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh yes.  So true.
      **Niles:** I can honestly say I never saw a false moment.
     **Trevor:** Well, what about the third act?  The play clearly has a 
             third act problem.
      **Niles:** Well, at least it has a third act, unlike "The Silent Echo" 
             which really could have used one. [_Frasier gives him a 
             dark look._]
     **Trevor:** I quite agree.  I did "The Silent Echo" in London, last year.  
             What did you think of the hat scene? [_Frasier now gives Niles 
             a cheery "What now?" look._]
      **Niles:** The hat scene?  Well, you know, the most important thing 
             about the hat scene, and I have to stress this... oh dear 
             God, is that clock right?  I have to call the sitter and 
             tell her I'm going to be late.  The children worry so. 
             [_He rushes off._]
     **Trevor:** Well, back to the play.
    **Frasier:** Right.  Well, you, of course, were brilliant.
     **Trevor:** Oh, please!  Dr. Crane, I just want your professional analysis 
             of what you saw tonight.
    **Frasier:** Well, it, uh... of course I could discuss subtext, metaphor 
             and imagery with you, but you see, I, I come to the theater to 
             feel.  To be moved, and that is exactly what happened to me 
             tonight.
     **Trevor:** Really?  When?
    **Frasier:** When?  Well, let me see...uh, um, well, there was that, uh, 
             the gutting the fish scene.  You make the most heart-breaking 
             gesture...  It was, uh, you know, the one with, with your 
             hands... [_He motions vaguely._]
     **Trevor:** Oh, you mean when I offer the fish to my son and he turns 
             his back to me and I reach out to him like this? [_does so_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's even more moving the second time.  Well, who 
             knows why a, a moment like that touches us so.  You see, 
             that is your gift, Sir Trevor.  You've given us hundreds of 
             moments.  Moments so real, so compelling that we are
             revealed in their truth.
     **Trevor:** You don't know how refreshing this is.  To meet someone who 
             doesn't just come to the theater, but who gives himself 
             over to it.  That crowd in there, they only come because 
             it's fashionable.  They don't care about art.  I can spot 
             them at a glance: the poseur, the fraud.  Oh, here comes 
             your brother.
      **Niles:**[_sitting down again_] Kids are fine.  
     **Trevor:** Oh.
    _Frasier glares at his brother._
    **Waitress:** Excuse me Sir Trevor, they're waiting for you in the 
              dining room.
      **Trevor:** Ah, very well. [_stands up and takes Frasier by the shoulders_] 
              And thank you, Dr. Crane, for your integrity and your passion.  
              You are the reason that actors act.  
    _He exits, not noticing Frasier nearly weeping as the full realization 
    of what he passed up hits him._
      **Niles:** Well, I'm sorry I deserted you but obviously you carried 
             the day.  Bravo!
    **Frasier:**[_disgusted with himself_] Oh, yes, bravo for us!
    _Catching Frasier's tone, Niles loses his cheer and sinks onto the stool
    next to Frasier's._
      **Niles:**[_half-expecting the answer_] What do you mean?
    **Frasier:** Do you realize what we missed tonight?  A potentially 
             life-changing experience in the theater.  And why?  
             Because we were too embarrassed to be seen in a 
             cancellation line.
      **Niles:** You're right.  What were we thinking?  Kowtowing to a 
             group of snobs like that.
    **Frasier:** We weren't thinking.  Come on, let's get out of here.
    _They start to exit, Susan comes in behind them._
      **Susan:** Frasier, Niles.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Susan, I'm so sorry, but we can't stay.
      **Susan:** Oh, no.  Sir Trevor will be so disappointed.  He was quite 
             taken with you.
    **Frasier:** Well, send him our apologies.  It really was wonderful to 
             meet him.
      **Susan:** I know this is short notice, but if you're free this weekend, 
             we're having one of our Sunday brunches.  Senator Logan is 
             coming and Maria DeFalco and the Whitneys...
    **Frasier:** Yes, but I'm afraid that we...
      **Susan:** Oh, please try.  I'll hold it open for you.  Check your 
             books and let me know. [_She goes back to the dining room._]
    **Frasier:** Well, how's that for irony?
      **Niles:** Sunday brunch at the Kendalls'.  An hour ago we would have 
             leapt at that invitation.
    **Frasier:** Not anymore.  We've got a damn sight too much integrity.  
             [_They start to leave._] Although... Are we being selfish?
      **Niles:** Possibly.  How?
    **Frasier:** Here's my thinking.  Why do shallow people remain that way?  
             The lack of positive influence.
      **Niles:** Perhaps our brand of integrity is just what that group 
             needs.
    **Frasier:** Yes!  We can be like those politicians who try to change 
             the system from within.
      **Niles:** Exactly.  And who knows?  Maybe it'll rub off on Senator 
             Logan, he'll bring it back with him to Washington.
    **Frasier:** Well now we HAVE to go.
    _They head out._
      **Niles:** What are you wearing?
    **Frasier:** I'm going to wear my new Prada suit.
      **Niles:** Oh, you're a fashion plate and a patriot.
    _Fade out._
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles comes into the kitchen, finds the paper with Daphne's photo cut 
    out and checks the page number.  He then pulls out another copy of 
    the paper and checks the back page, scanning for the photo.  Finding 
    it, he is stunned.  He carefully folds the paper, tucks it under his 
    arm and, after a moment to compose himself, walks out of the kitchen.
