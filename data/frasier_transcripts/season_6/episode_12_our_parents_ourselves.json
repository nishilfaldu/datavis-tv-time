He goes to put it in the suggestion box but as he gets there, Thad comes out.  Niles crumples the note and Thad holds up the trash can for him.  Niles ends up throwing the note past his head and runs out.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Special Guest Star** EVA MARIE SAINT as Joanna Doyle  **Guest Starring** ALICE PLAYTEN as Bonnie ROCKY McMURRAY as Jimbo  **Guest Callers** PHIL DONAHUE as Larry MARLO THOMAS as Sophie   * * *  ## Quick Summary {nicholas hartley}    _ACT ONE  SCENE ONE - KACL_  Frasier is on air and is taking his last caller. It's a woman who says her husband is having a superbowl party on Sunday for his friends however he won't let her friends come over. The husband comes onto the phone and says he'll let them come over if he can answer a simple football question. Roz mimes the answers to Frasier in order he can get it correct. After signing off as \"Coach Crane\" he has a chat with Roz where she reveals that her mother is in town and has become a burden. Frasier suggests that she should start dating Martin to get her out of the house. So they agree to \"accidentaly\" meet at McGinteys.   Martin, Frasier and Niles are seated at a table as the waitress; Bonny comes over. She seems to know Martin. After greeting him she realises who Frasier is and talks about how proud Martin is of him. Then she turns to Niles and thinks he's a friend. Martin covers up saying \"I've told you about my other son\". However Bonny still gets it wrong and calls him Eddie. After she's left, some people from the Shang-ri-la enter who Niles trys to hide from. However they spot and proceed to play fight calling him the coyote. Niles explains his nickname: It went from Niles to Niley to Nile. E. Coyote and then just to coyote. However at that moments it's refined further as the shang-ri-la guys address him with a coyote growl. After this Roz and her mother, Joanna, enter. Frasier notices her and pretends he didn't expect her. He gets them to sit at the table - with Joanna next to Martin.   Everyone has finished eating however Martin & Joanna are the only ones who have cleared their plates. They explain how they never worried about calories in their day and how they ate full cooked breakfasts. Niles is disturbed by this. Roz suggests to Joanna that they better leave as they have a jazz concert. However, Frasier stops her and tells Roz they must discuss the promos. This was obviously planned as Roz decides to give her ticket to Martin so the two \"love birds\" can go off together. Joanna and Martin agree as Niles, Frasier and Roz leave saying that they have no idea it was a set up. However we see that they do know.   Daphne and Frasier are watching a \"Miss. World\" pagent whilst eating popcorn. Roz comes in looking worried, she explains her worry to Frasier. However he's not really listning to her as he watches her pagent making sarcastic comments with Daphne about the women. Roz explains how her mother MUST BE perfect, she says SHE NEVER makes wrong choices. Roz explains how Martin isn't right for her. Frasier is angered by this as he believes Roz thinks her mother is too high up to be dating someone as low down as retired cop. They begin arguing as Daphne trys to watch the television. Daphne gets up in a huff saying she just missed something before storming off to her room. Frasier tells Roz to stop worrying just before they hear the front door opening. Roz and Frasier quickly head to the sofa to look at the promos, as if they had been doing that all the time.  Martin and Joanna enter looking pleased with each other. They make little comments and it seems they want to see each other again. Joanna leaves so Martin can tell his TRUE side of the story to Frasier. Martin says that he actually hated the date. He says she droned on and on with boring facts; eg: the egg production in Wisconsin. Martin heads off to the room with the words \"If you ever set me up on a date again, I'll kill you in your sleep!\" Frasier is shocked by this and rather distressed.  Frasier rushes to the door, it's Roz. She looks really excited and explains how her mother had such a good time. Joanna cannot wait for a second date. Roz also says how a wall has been broken down between her and her mother. She says she will now talk openly about how she felt when her father left. She really is exstatic. At this point Martin walks out saying \"her voice is still in my head\". Frasier cannot bring himself to tell her that Martin hated the date and says \"it's like a fairytale here too!\"  _ACT TWO  SCENE ONE - CAFE NERVOSA_  Niles and Frasier are at the bar. Niles takes a drink from his cappuchino and he puts it down in disgust. He says that each week there gets more foam and less coffee. He decides to tell the waiter, however when he realises the waiter is a bit too macho for him he changes his mind and looks for the suggestion box. Frasier tells him about Martin's date and not being able to tell Roz. Niles tell Frasier he must do the right thing and tell the truth.  Roz enters and begins talking to Frasier. She says Martin hasn't rung yet. Frasier again can't bring himself to say anything so instead says he will. Roz looks at her calender and checks it with Frasier. He makes excuses up for every day. So Roz suggests that she brings Joanna up on Sunday to their super bowl party, which Frasier has no way of escaping out of.  She leaves and Frasier tells Niles the news, and that he must also be at the superbowl party. Niles gives Frasier some advice: to tell Martin about this five minutes before. If he tells him in advance he'll probably escape to McGinteys. So Frasier decides this is probably the best option in the long run.   Martin is watching the warm up before the superbowl on the television and Frasier swims around laying out food. The doorbell sounds and he takes Martin aside. He says it will be Joanna which just angers Martin. He answers the door, surprisingly, to Bonny who is carrying some food. She makes her way to the kitchen as Martin explains that he invited her over in order to ask her on a date. Frasier is distraught by this as he answers the door to Joanna. Joanna and Martin begin chatting before they take the baby away to a room.  Bonny then enters laying the food out and Roz inquires about why she's here. Frasier pretends that Martin invited her here for Niles. Bonny is confused by this. At this point Niles enters through the front door and hangs up his coat. He is shocked when he realises that Bonny is his date however he goes along with it to be polite. Daphne enters at this point and heads out the door - she explains she's going to see \"Whuthering Heights\" at the cinema by herself. She goes onto say how, if there was someone there, she would only end up crying in her dates shoulder.  After sampling one of Bonny's culinary \"delights\" he enters the kitchen. Martin enters just after him. Niles tells him off for setting him up with Bonny. Martin tells Niles he invited her here for himself, and that it was probably Frasier's idea so not to offend \"Miss. Snoozey\". Frasier enters the kitchen and tells them to see to the dates however Niles & Martin disagree saying they hate them.  They all enter the room where Joanna begins talking about the baby. Bonny asks to see the baby, so Martin takes her off. Unfortunately the baby monitor is switched on and the conversation about the dates are heard. Both Martin and Bonny don't like their dates. Upon hearing this, Niles takes flight in order to catch up with Daphne at the movies.  Joanna is a little disturbed by this but says she's not too offended. She leaves without saying goodbye to Martin. Roz follows her after shouting at Frasier.   Later on, Roz comes back up to his apartment and they talk about looking at their parents love life and comparing it with their own. They explain that they'll probably never get married and time is runnung out. Frasier says they should make a pact; like in forty years if they find no one they should marry each other. Roz says she was going to say \"kill each other\". ",
