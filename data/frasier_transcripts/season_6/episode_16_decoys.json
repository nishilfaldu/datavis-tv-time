But Kathy Churay has written a quick synopsis for those in a hurry._  ACT ONE  Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment - Day _  Martin is reading the paper and Frasier is at the table writing a letter as Donny and Daphne come in from a walk in the park.  Daphne is glowing -- Donny romantically hid a basket filled with English goodies under a bush in the park where Daphne would find it. (Horrible stuff -- blood pudding, jellied eels, kidney pie.)  Donny is clearly smitten.  Niles enters from the kitchen, greets Daphne warmly and gives Donny a decidedly cool reception.  Donny tosses Niles a set of keys which prove to be the keys to Shady Glen, Maris's lakefront cottage which Donny has acquired for Niles in the settlement.  Niles is grateful but obviously torn, wanting to hate Donny but aware of the wonderful job Donny's doing as his advocate.  He's even more conflicted as Daphne gives Donny a warm kiss goodbye at the door.   After Donny's departure Niles tries to tell Daphne how ruthless lawyers are, to which Daphne responds that Donny is incredibly romantic, and exits happily to her room.  Frasier reproves Niles for his unseemly behavior.  Niles protests that for the first time he's free and single, and now Daphne is seeing someone.

Niles is enthused and begins selling the place to Martin -- stereo, big screen TV, wine cellar and sauna.  Frasier catches Niles' enthusiasm and says he will buy a couple of ducks on the way up to make his famous Duck a l'Orange.  Martin happily agrees and exits to his room. Frasier goes out to mail his letter.  Frasier is barely out the door when Daphne reappears and Niles is offering to drive her up to the cottage on Friday night.  \"We're all going, and Dad and Frasier will be right behind.\"  But Daphne can't. One of her cousins will be in San Francisco over the weekend and Daphne's promised to fly down. Donny's not coming with her, though. \"That would have meant staying in a hotel together and I'm not sure we're ready for that yet.\"  Niles is shocked and delighted to find out she and Donny aren't sleeping together yet.  _FADE OUT  Scene 2 - Cafe Nervosa_  Niles and Martin are having coffee as Roz comes over with a cup of coffee and nowhere to sit in the crowded cafe.

Niles is delighted to see him and Donny is happily planning to get lots of work done over the weekend until Roz emerges from the kitchen.  Niles starts to introduce them, but \"That's right, you two already know each other!\"  He sips his wine innocently as Roz stands transfixed at the sight of Donny, who greets her very warmly with a kiss and a hug.  (Nice guy, this Donny!)  Donny wants a place to leave his briefcase and Niles directs him to an upstairs bedroom, carefully pointing out, \"But don't wake Roz's baby!  She's in that first room.\"  Donny the aspiring family man is delighted.  \"Roz, you've got a baby?  Congratulations!  That means",

Roz is sorely tempted but accuses Niles of doing this just so he can have Daphne. ",

    {
        "speaker": "Niles",
        "text": "** \"Yes!  Yes!  Yes, I want Daphne.  I think we belong together, just like I think you and Donny belong together.  And why should two people be happy when four people can be ecstatic?\"  Roz is weakening but still resistant, when Donny comes out of the bedroom carrying Alice.  Apparently Alice doesn't take to strangers, but she's putty in the hands of Donny.  That's it for Roz.  With a last glance back at Niles and a whispered \"How's my hair?\" she follows Donny out of the room.  Niles is just settling down on the couch with a self-satisfied smile and a glass of wine when Frasier and Martin burst through the front door with a hearty greeting.  Niles appalled at their arrival a day early.  Martin's dentist was sick, and the butcher shop was closed, so they headed up to the cabin early, with all the fixings for dinner except for the duck.  Martin says it's no problem.  Patting the rack of shotguns by the front door, he declares they can go out and shoot their own ducks.  Frasier refuses, but Martin argues for the hunt, and goes off to the mud room to find ammunition for the shotguns.  Niles is attempting to push a resisting Frasier back out the front door toward the duck blind, but Frasier refuses.  \"What the hell is going on? Are you trying to get rid of us?\"  Niles' denial is cut short by Roz emerging from the bedroom.   To Frasier's shocked inquiry she replies, \"Niles brought me,\" then goes out to the kitchen to heat up a baby bottle for Alice.  As soon as she's out of the room Martin begins to chuckle slyly and nudge Niles knowingly.  \"Roz?\" Frasier inquires in disbelief.  Niles decides to go with it and says he brought Roz to the cabin with romantic intentions. After all, he's just following Frasier's advice to make a fresh start. Martin, meanwhile, decides to cooperate with Niles' new romance and pushes a reluctant Frasier out the door with the rifles and hunting gear.  As Frasier and Martin leave, Donny emerges from the bedroom and is about to go out the front door to his car to retrieve something, but Niles pushes him out the back instead so he doesn't run into Frasier and Martin.  Just as Donny leaves, Frasier comes back in the front to try to persuade Niles against forming a relationship with Roz.  Niles tells him Roz is a sweet person underneath her rough exterior, and even Roz's call of  \"Niles, have you seen my nipples?\" from the kitchen isn't enough to dissuade him. Frasier leaves in a huff.   As Frasier and Martin are sitting in the camouflage blind waiting for ducks, they are discussing Niles's romance with Roz.  Frasier is appalled, can't think of two people who are more different.  But Martin points out that he and Hester were very different people and had 40 happy years together. Frasier can't think of a rejoinder to that argument, and has to admit he might be wrong.  Knowing how his opinion influences Niles, he decides to go back to the house to tell Niles about his change of heart.   Donny and Roz are sitting on the couch enjoying the wine and one of Donny's funny stories as Niles emerges from the kitchen with a plate of canapes. Donny goes off to the kitchen to fetch another bottle of wine, leaving Niles to grill Roz about her progress with Donny.  Roz is worried that Frasier and Martin will show up at any minute and blow the whole plan, but Niles has another idea.  Roz will take Donny down to the lake to watch the sunset, where she'll work her charms on him, invite him out to dinner, and then, who knows?  Niles volunteers to stay with the baby.  But Frasier walks in just in time to hear Niles planning to stay inside with Alice.  Frasier is appalled to think his opinion of their romance is dampening their ardor, and he pushes them out the door toward the lake to watch the sunset, following close behind them.  As he leaves the room Donny emerges from the kitchen into a now-empty living room with the wine bottle.  He doesn't have much time to wonder about it as he hears Alice crying from upstairs and goes off to comfort her.  Frasier returns to the cabin for the ammunition and spots Donny's wine bottle.  He picks it up, takes a sniff, makes a face and exits to the kitchen.  As he leaves Niles and Roz sneak back in the front door.  Niles heads into the kitchen loudly dropping hints about Roz going to watch the sunset, but instead of Donny he finds Frasier, who pushes him back out into the living room and out the front door again with Roz. Frasier follows.  As the door closes Donny emerges from the bedroom into an empty living room, glances around, picks up a folder of documents and goes off to the study to fax them.  As he leaves Frasier enters and heads for the kitchen, where he is startled to meet Daphne coming in with her overnight bag.  Daphne tells Frasier about Niles' invitation, but Frasier tells her she has to leave because Niles is at the cabin for an intimate weekend with Roz.  Daphne is surprised and reluctant to leave, having just driven two hours and arriving just dark is approaching.  But Frasier is persuasive, and she agrees to go to a local bed and breakfast, to be quickly followed by Frasier and Martin.  She heads for the powder room just off the living room.  Frasier hears Alice crying and runs up the stairs to her room.  Roz and Niles sneak back into the cabin looking for Donny.  Niles notices Alice's door ajar and creeps over to the door, hissing, \"Why don't I take over here and you can join Roz?\"  Frasier emerges from Alice's room and once again tries to push Roz and Niles out the door. But this time Roz refuses. \"I really think I should check on Alice.\" Frasier tries again, but Niles refuses too.  Niles drags a wing chair over in front of the kitchen door and sits in it, effectively blocking Donny who is trying to open the kitchen door but can only bump the back of Niles' chair.  Niles beckons Roz over to him and she sits on the arm of his chair as Niles tells Frasier to clear out so he and Roz can be alone.  Frasier frantically to persuade them to leave as he blocks the bathroom door with his own body so Daphne can't emerge into the living room.  Just then Martin comes in, looking for ammunition for the shotguns before the light goes and they can't shoot any more ducks.  He's looking for a bathroom too, but Frasier tells him it's out of order. He heads for the one in the back of the cabin, but Niles is still blocking the kitchen door and tells him that one's out of order too.  Frasier accuses Niles of plotting some strategy, saying that Niles is showing absolutely no interest in being alone with Roz.  Niles indignantly denies it.  \"Come here, Pookie!\" he tells Roz, pulling her onto his lap and kissing her lengthily.  But it's no good.  Donny comes through the front door and sees Roz and Niles kissing.  Then Daphne emerges from the bathroom and sees Donny.  Niles drops Roz unceremoniously on the floor when he sees Daphne.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ",
