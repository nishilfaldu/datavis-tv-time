[_N.B. Throughout the rest of this scene, all of Niles's dialogue is mutters or mumbles as he deals with the situation._] _He starts a CD of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" on the stereo, then sits on the couch.  He examines a crease on his pant leg, then adjusts it.  He then uncrosses his legs and compares the creases. He stands up and fluffs his pants legs out, then sits again.  He looks at his watch, examines his crease again, then gets up.  He goes to the kitchen and brings back the ironing board and a cloth. He sets up the board and plugs the iron in.  He removes his shoes, then his trousers, turning his back nervously on Eddie to do so. Laying them on the board, he covers the crease with the cloth and begins pressing them.  After glancing at his watch, he begins pressing faster.  Reaching for the cuff, he notices a loose thread. He tries to pull it off, then bite it off, but is unsuccessful.  He rushes over to the desk and gets a pair of scissors from the drawer.  He starts to hurry back to the ironing board, but slows and carefully makes sure the scissors are pointing down.  As he trims the loose thread, Eddie jumps on a dining chair and starts nosing around a place setting.  Niles notices and starts to yell at him, but ends up cutting his finger.  He yelps, puts the finger in his mouth and then looks at it.  It is bleeding, and the sight of blood makes him woozy.  He recovers, but notices Eddie still licking around the plate.  He snaps his fingers at him, which aggravates the injury and makes him look at his finger again.  This time, he passes out and falls over the arm of the couch.  Eddie comes over and licks his face, waking him.  He glances at his finger, then holds it up away from his face.  Looking down, he notices a spot of blood he's left on the couch.  He dabs it with his handkerchief, but it isn't effective.  He wraps the handkerchief around his finger, and goes to the kitchen, returning with a cloth and a can of solvent.  He sits on the couch and tries to read the instructions, bringing a candle closer for more light.  Apparently reaching the part about open flames, he hurriedly pushes the candle away.  Opening the can, he soaks a bit onto the cloth and begins dabbing up the blood stain.  He stands up to check his work and is satisfied.  When he's reaching for the cap to the can, however, his handkerchief falls off, he sees his bloody finger and again faints over the arm of the couch.  This time, the open can of solvent begins spilling onto and soaking into the couch.  Eddie barks loudly, waking him again.  He gets up, holding his wounded finger above his head once more.  He picks up the handkerchief to put on his finger, then gets the can and caps it, all over his head as Eddie looks on.  He goes into the kitchen and -  Reset to: the kitchen where Niles puts the solvent away under the sink and throws the towel into it.  Standing there, he begins to smell something.  He quickly checks the pots on the stove and in the oven, but they are all right.  He looks about in confusion, then exits.  Reset to: the living room.  Niles stands around, obviously still smelling something wrong.  His gaze travels to the ironing board just in time to see that the iron, which he left face down, has set his pants on fire.  He rushes over and grabs the iron, setting it aside.  He then tries to pat the flames out, only spreading them.  He tries to bundle the pants up but, burning his fingers, throws them away from himself. This carries them onto the couch where they promptly ignite the soaked- in solvent in a burst of flames.  Eddie barks as Niles stares, frozen.  Finally, he breaks and runs to the hallway, returning with a fire extinguisher.  He runs in front of the couch and squeezes the handle.  Nothing happens, and he notices that the safety pin is still in place.  He pulls it free and squeezes again.  The force of the extinguisher is too much for him to control, and he spins wildly around, dousing all the furniture, the carpet, the table setting, Eddie and himself with foam as Eddie furiously barks at him.  He gets it under control just in time to point it at the couch as it runs out of pressure.  He throws the empty extinguisher on Martin's chair and races to the kitchen.  He comes back with and oven mitt and pot holder and carrying the pans from the stove.  He empties the dinner onto the fire, putting it out and raising a cloud of steam.  Choking on the smoke and fumes, Niles opens the front door.  Looking desperately at his watch, he begins fanning the door to try and clear some of the smoke.  He then starts fanning with his arms, swinging so wildly that the mitt, pot holder and handkerchief all fly into the hall.  He glances at his finger, sees the blood and faints in the doorway.  As the smoke alarm goes off, Eddie jumps on the couch and begins eating the remains of the food.  The Mozart piece reaches a crescendo and ends.
