## Details

    
    
    It's time for the Gourmet Club's annual "Golden Apron Awards." Niles 
    wants to win desperately to salvage his fragile ego after the year 
    he's been through. There is just one glitch - the candidates vying 
    for the award have to throw a dinner party. Having moved out of The 
    Montana and into the Shangri-La, Niles searches for a place to hold 
    the dinner party when he comes upon a brilliant idea... break into 
    Maris's beach house while she is out of town. Just when everything 
    appears to have fallen into place, Niles's dinner party curse strikes 
    yet again in the guise of a dead seal that has washed ashore.

    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 - Cafe Nervosa
    Fade in.  Roz is sitting at the table by the bookshelves, Frasier 
    comes up and joins her._
    
    **Frasier:** What a glorious day!  Can't help but put a bounce in one's 
             step, can it?
        **Roz:**[_trying to open some aspirin_] If you're gonna be cheerful, 
             sit somewhere else.  Damn it!  I broke a nail.
    **Frasier:** Here.
    
    _Frasier takes the bottle as Niles comes up._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** If my life gets any worse, I'm phoning Hell to ask about 
             their exchange program. [_He sits._]
    **Frasier:** Well, lucky me, I stumbled in at happy hour.
    
    _He opens the aspirin and gives it to Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** Here.  So, Niles, Maris at it again?
      **Niles:** Oh, worse.  It's so depressing I can barely talk about it.  
             My gourmet club is holding elections to see who will win 
             this year's Golden Apron...
        **Roz:** Wait.  I can see I'm gonna need a hanky for this.
      **Niles:**[_to waiter_] Latte, please, to go.  Normally, the finalists 
             compete by giving lectures.  I'd written mine, a waggish look 
             at food fads of yesteryear entitled "Fondue: What Were We 
             Thinking?"  
    
    _Frasier chuckles and nods approval._
    
      **Niles:** Suddenly last night, disaster.  Someone proposed that instead 
             of giving lectures, this year's finalists compete by hosting 
             dinner parties in their homes.
        **Roz:** So?  Why don't you invite 'em all over and cook 'em a meal?
      **Niles:** At the Shangri-La?  I can't tell the cream of Seattle's 
             gourmet set that I've moved out of the Montana and into 
             that gulag with a game room.  I'll just have to drop out 
             of the race.
    **Frasier:** Let's not be hasty.  Let's give this some thought.  Every 
             problem has a solution.
        **Roz:** Do you call that a problem?  A problem is when your kid keeps 
             you up three nights in a row with colic, and you're so burned 
             out you rear-end a Lexus, with four passengers, each and every 
             one a lawyer, so you'll probably be sued and spend the rest of 
             your working life, if you ever even GET a job, lining the 
             pockets of four blood-sucking, whiplash-faking fat cats.  
             THAT'S what a problem is.
    **Frasier:** Can you have it at a restaurant?
      **Niles:** It's against the rules.
        **Roz:** Thanks for the sympathy!
    
    _She stomps off._
    
    **Frasier:** Well...
      **Niles:** Sympathy for what?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know, she broke a nail.
    
    _The waiter brings Niles his coffee._
    
    **Frasier:** Anyway, Niles, try as I might, I can't think of a single thing.
             I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** Well, don't blame yourself.  Blame Claudia Kynock, the whole 
             dinner scheme was her greedy notion.
    **Frasier:** Claudia Kynock?  Kevin's widow?
      **Niles:** Can you believe it?  She owns six newspapers and nine radio 
             stations, she'll still cadge a free meal faster than that 
             bulbous cartoon fellow who mooches hamburgers from Popeye.  
             I know I must sound...
    **Frasier:** Wimpy.
      **Niles:** And whiny too.  But... I wanted this.  And after the year 
             I've been through, I needed something to restore my pride, 
             my dignity, my manhood.  That Golden Apron could do it.
    **Frasier:** And you are going to have it.  You can have the dinner party 
             at my house.
      **Niles:** You mean it?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I'll tell you what: I'll rent an extra-large table 
             and I'll share in the hosting chores.
      **Niles:** You are a saint. 
    _Niles's coffee comes, and he and Frasier get up._
      **Niles:** Though I did note you only offered after you found that out 
             our club includes a rich station owner who could give you a 
             job.
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles, I must say I'm hurt.  I offer you something out 
             of the goodness of my heart, you make it sound like I'm a 
             shallow opportunist.
      **Niles:** I'm terribly sorry.  How can I make it up to you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know.  Sit me next to someone interesting.
      **Niles:** Oh, Claudia, perhaps.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Put her on my left, it's my best side.
    
    _They leave.  Fade out._
    
    **SEOUL MATES**
    
    _Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Daphne is sitting on the couch with her friend Pam, 
    drinking wine._
    
        **Pam:** He actually marked the bottle so he'd know if you took some?
     **Daphne:** Yeah.  Then he marched into my room and confronted me with 
             the evidence.  I said "All right.  If you want to be such a 
             miser, then fine, I'll buy my own bath salts."
    _Martin comes in from his room, trying to act casual.  He is wearing 
    a sweater which notably is the same garish-yet-typically-Martin one 
    that Daphne gave him for Christmas in "Perspectives On Christmas" 
    last season._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, Pam.  I didn't know you were here.
     **Daphne:** I told you this morning she was coming by.
     **Martin:** It musta slipped my mind.  Don't you look nice tonight.
        **Pam:** You too, Martin.  I love your sweater.
     **Martin:** Yeah, pretty cheerful, huh?  Not everyone can wear these 
             colors.
     **Daphne:** It helps if you're a matador. [_to Pam_] Come on, we don't 
             want to be late for the movie.
    
    _They get up, Daphne grabbing the wine and glasses._
    
        **Pam:** Can I freshen up first?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, yeah, right through there.
    
    _Pam goes into the powder room, Daphne turns on Martin._
    
     **Daphne:** You dirty old man!  Flirting with a girl her age!
     **Martin:** Well, she was flirting right back.  I saw her giving me the 
             once-over.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, she looked once and it was over.
    
    _She heads into the kitchen, Martin follows._
    
     **Daphne:** You've never acted this silly with any of my other girl 
             friends.  What's so special about Pam?
     **Martin:** Oh, nothing.  She's just young and friendly, and... she reminds 
             me of the girls I used to date back during the war.
     **Daphne:** What, you mean Korea?  Mr. Crane, it's not dating when 
             you're an occupying force.
     **Martin:** Well, just ask her if she's interested.
     **Daphne:** Have you lost your mind?
     **Martin:** Hey, the gals in Pyong Chang used to think I was pretty damn
             cute.
     **Daphne:** Yeah well, this is a bit different.  You're not twenty-one and 
             her village hasn't just burned down.
    
    _Cut to - the living room as they come out of the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** You're not going to get her with a kind smile and a Hershey 
             bar.
     **Martin:** Oh, just ask her, OK?
     **Daphne:**[_grabbing her coat_] You know, this explains that so-called 
             "mix-up" with those mail order videos.  Mistake my fanny, 
             you ordered "The Joy Luck Club"!
    
    _Niles and Frasier come in the front as Pam comes out of the powder 
    room.  Martin sits in his chair._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi Dad, Daphne.  Pam, nice to see you.
     **Daphne:** Good night, all.
     **Martin:** Pam?
    
    _She turns to him, he waves goodbye and says something in Korean.
    From her confused look, we can tell that Martin has either 
    butchered her language or said something extremely rude._
    
     **Daphne:** Just keep moving.
    _They leave.  Niles dials his cell phone as Frasier hangs up his coat._
      **Niles:** What's with Dad?
    **Frasier:** It's a Korea thing, don't ask.
    
    _He heads over to pour sherries._
    
      **Niles:**[_on his cell phone_] Oh, my God!  He said yes, I've got him! 
             [_hangs up_] That was a message from Marcel DeBoeuf!  He's 
             agreed to cater my dinner for the gourmet club.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, that is a coup.
     **Martin:** Who?
    **Frasier:** Marcel DeBoeuf, Dad.  He's the famous sculpter-turned-chef.  
             Each plate is a work of art. [_brings Niles his sherry_]
      **Niles:** He's doing his all-truffle menu. [_Frasier gasps_] For the 
             appetizer, he sculpts tiny mushroom trees, then he carves 
             radishes to look like truffle pigs, snuffling around the 
             roots.
     **Martin:** Oh.  Maybe I should do that for Eddie.  I could mold his 
             Alpo into a cow.
      **Niles:**[_laughs, then_] That reminds me...
    **Frasier:** I got him Sonics tickets.
     **Martin:** Bless you.  Oh!  And did I mention, they're predicting 
             meteor showers for that evening!  So not only will I 
             have a great meal, in a perfect setting... 
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** But we'll have nature itself putting on a show for us. [_points
             out to the balcony_] Oh, we'll have an excellent view from 
             right...
    _He gasps suddenly, and moves closer to the balcony.  There is a large 
    piece of tape across one of the windows._
    
      **Niles:** Dear God, what's that?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just a small crack, a little bird flew into it 
             the other day.  I'm replacing the pane next week.
      **Niles:** Next week?
    **Frasier:** Yes. 
      **Niles:** Well, that's too late.
    **Frasier:** It's just a piece of tape!  No one will even notice.
      **Niles:** You have no idea how cutthroat my rivals are.  They will leap 
             on the tiniest imperfection.  Last night, Sebastian Melmoth 
             threw a lavish Japanese banquet.  A certain rival spent the 
             entire evening carping about how the _obis_ on the geishas' 
             kimonos were improperly tied.
    **Frasier:** "A certain rival?"
      **Niles:** All right, me.
     **Martin:** He had geishas?
    **Frasier:** That's enough, Dad.
      **Niles:** Well, I'll just have to have the party somewhere else.
    **Frasier:** But Niles, you promised you'd have it here.  You promised me 
             Claudia Kynock.
     **Martin:** Nobody's gonna notice that window, and besides, who else is 
             gonna loan you their place?  It's not like you can ask Maris.
    
    _At that, Niles has a brilliant idea._
    
      **Niles:** I don't have to ask her.  She's out of the country.  She's 
             in Antwerp having her elbows done.  She has that stunning 
             beach house.  I'm sure I can get past the alarm.
     **Martin:** Isn't that breaking and entering?
      **Niles:** Oh, pish.  It can't be a crime if it's catered.
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles, I hope you have a lovely time.
      **Niles:** Oh, don't sulk Frasier.  You can still come.  I've got to 
             start planning.  Wait 'til you see this place.  It's right 
             on the beach, it's ideal for viewing the meteor shower.
    
    _Niles heads for the door._
    
     **Martin:** Maybe Chef Marcel can make your truffles look like little 
             meteors zooming around the plates. [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** We make fun of him, but every now and then he has a
             fantastic idea.
    
    _They leave.  Fade out._
    
    **NOT WHAT GOOD HOUSEKEEPING
    HAD IN MIND**
    
    _Scene 3 - The Beach House
    Fade in.  Niles and Frasier are on the front porch opening the door.  
    They each have garment bags, Niles has some flowers and Frasier has a 
    grocery bag._
    
    **Frasier:** I hope you're right about the alarm code, Niles.  People do 
             change them.
      **Niles:** Maris will never change this one.
    
    _Niles opens the door, a beeping can be heard.  Cut to - the interior 
    of the beach house as they enter._
     
      **Niles:** It's her ideal weight.  What she weighed at her debutante 
             ball.  [_He punches into a small key pad._] Let's see, this 
             many pounds, and that many ounces.
    **Frasier:** Good lord, no one could weigh that and live!
    
    _The beeping stops.  A voice, Gretchen, is heard calling._
    
    **Gretchen:**[_off stage; German accent_] Maris!
       **Niles:** Oh no, not her.
     **Frasier:** Neighbor?
       **Niles:** Yes, Gretchen Kuntz.  The old girl's been smitten with Maris 
              ever since she taught falconry at Maris's finishing school. 
              [_He hands Frasier the flowers._] Here, put these in water and 
              I'll get rid of her.
    **Gretchen:**[_o.s._] Maris, _liebchen_.  Is that you?
    
    _Frasier heads to the kitchen, Niles opens the door to her._
    
    **Gretchen:** Oh, Dr. Crane.
       **Niles:** Hello, Gretchen.
    **Gretchen:** I'm surprised to see you here.  When last I spoke to Maris, 
              she said your marriage had come to a timely end.
       **Niles:** Yes, well, it's all patched up now, we couldn't be happier.  
              [_running water is heard from the kitchen_] In fact, that's 
              Maris in the kitchen now.  We're terribly busy. [_calls_] I'll 
              be right with you, muffin!  But I'll tell her you looked in.
    **Gretchen:** Do.  Ask her to stop by.  My wolfhound had puppies.
    _Niles closes the door on her.  Frasier comes out with the flowers in 
    a vase._
    
      **Niles:** Let's get some lights on.
    
    _He claps his hands and a rather garish lamp shaped like an anchor 
    comes on._
    
    **Frasier:** Good lord, what the hell is that?
      **Niles:** Maris had it made after she lost power in a storm.  Battery 
             operated, works on a clapper [_claps it off_] so you can find 
             it in the dark. [_claps it on_] Only problem was, the poor 
             thing, try as she might, she could never clap hard enough to 
             activate it.
    
    _Frasier opens the curtains revealing the French doors to the back 
    deck._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, this view is breathtaking!  You know, with a 
             setting like this and Chef Marcel in the kitchen, I think 
             that Golden Apron is as good as yours.
      **Niles:** Well...
    
    _They open the doors and step out.  Cut to - the rear deck.   The two 
    take a deep breath of the sea air... and begin choking and gagging._
    
      **Niles:** What is that revolting smell?!
    **Frasier:** It smells like it's coming from the beach.
      **Niles:** Oh, it's like garbage or rotting fish...
    **Frasier:** Or a dead seal.
      **Niles:** No, it's more like a rendering plant.
    **Frasier:** No, Niles.  There's an extremely large dead seal right by 
             this dinghy.
      **Niles:** Oh, dear God!
    
    _He rushes back inside.  Frasier follows slowly._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, on the bright side, there's not a single crack in 
             these windows.
    
    _He closes the doors behind him.  Fade out.
    
    End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - The Beach House
    Fade in.  Frasier and Niles are standing on the back deck.  Frasier 
    has a handkerchief over his nose and mouth, Niles is on his cell 
    phone._
    
      **Niles:** Yes, Animal Control?  A large seal washed up on my property, 
             I need you to come remove it right away.  Its condition?  
             It's deceased.  What?  Oh, you're not serious. [_to Frasier_] 
             He says they only handle live seals. [_into phone_] What kind 
             of policy is that?  If it were alive, I wouldn't need you, 
             I could just scare it away myself.
    **Frasier:** I'd pay to see that.
      **Niles:** Oh, wait, I was mistaken.  It's not dead after all, it's 
             sitting up.  It looks very disoriented.  Come quickly!
    **Frasier:**[_grabbing the phone_] Give me that.  Hello, this is Frasier 
             Crane.  You may remember me from my radio show.
      **Niles:** Oh, yes, that should send the Seal Mobile racing over here.
    **Frasier:** Just how do you suggest we dispose of a dead seal?  I see.  
             I see.  Charming. [_He closes the phone._] Well, we have 
             two options.  We can either bury it or haul it out to sea, 
             in which case they suggest we stab some holes in it.
      **Niles:** Stab holes in it?
    **Frasier:** To make it less buoyant.
      **Niles:** It would certainly make me less buoyant.  Well, we'll have 
             to bury it.  Help me find a shovel.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    
    _Cut to - the interior.  As they come in, the doorbell rings._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, no.  That's Chef Marcel.  If he finds out what's out there, 
             he will walk.
    **Frasier:** Over a dead seal?
      **Niles:** He won't let anything upstage his food.  He stormed out of 
             Kate York's christening party over an ill-timed diaper change.  
             You let him in, I'll find a shovel.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    
    _Niles heads upstairs, Frasier opens the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, Chef Marcel, this is indeed an honor.  I'm Frasier, 
             Niles's brother...
     **Marcel:** Where is my kitchen?
    **Frasier:** It's, uh, right through there.
    _Marcel comes in, followed by his staff.  He stops in the living room._
     **Marcel:** What is that smell?
    **Frasier:** Uh, what smell?
     **Marcel:** Is there a baby here?
    **Frasier:** No.  I mean, yes.  Well, there was a baby, but it's gone now, 
             and we can air the place out.
     **Marcel:** Do.
    
    _He exits to the kitchen.  Niles comes down the stairs with two 
    children's beach pail and shovel sets.  He hands one to Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** Al right, let's do this.  Quick, quick, quick.
    **Frasier:** What's the matter, Niles, you couldn't find any _demitasse_ 
             spoons?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry.  This is all we have.
    **Frasier:** Niles, for God's sake, it'll take us until doomsday with 
             these things.  Let's just stick it in the dinghy and haul 
             it out to sea, come on.
      **Niles:** I'm not touching that thing with my bare hands!
    **Frasier:** All right, just go find a sheet or something to wrap it in.
    
    _Niles head back upstairs.  Cut to - the deck as Frasier comes out 
    and looks at the seal._
    
    **Frasier:** Poor noble creature.  At least in death, you've achieved a 
             kind of tragic dignity.
    
    _Niles comes out with a frilly nightgown._
    
      **Niles:** We can wrap it in this.  Quick, quick, quick.
    **Frasier:** A peach peignoir?
      **Niles:** Yes, and I found perfume.
    **Frasier:** We're giving it a burial, Niles, not a day of beauty.
      **Niles:** It's to cover the smell, and the peignoir was all I could 
             find.  The beds were all stripped, the linen cupboard's 
             locked.
    **Frasier:** All right, get on with it.
    
    _Niles sprays the seal with the perfume._
    
      **Niles:** Do you think that helped?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, Niles.  It smells so lovely now it's almost a shame 
             to bury it.  Give me a hand with this.  All right, OK, now 
             let's turn it over.
    
    _The wrap the seal up while making noises of disgust._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, have you ever seen anything so heartbreaking?  That 
             sullied nightgown, that cold vacant stare, those limp 
             little whiskers...
    **Frasier:** Stick a corncob pipe in its mouth, it could be Nana on 
             Dad's side.  Come on, let's go!
    
    _The grab the seal.  Fade out.
    
    Scene 2 - The Beach House
    Fade in.  Niles and Frasier are dragging the boat up onto the beach.  
    They are soaking wet._
    
      **Niles:** Nice oarsmanship, Mr. Oxford Rowing Champ!
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not very easy to keep your balance when your 
             crewmate jumps on your back and shrieks like a tea kettle.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sorry.  The thing's tongue lolled out and licked my 
             ankle.  I just hope the wind changes before the party, they'll 
             be here in fifteen minutes. [_sniffing_] The stench is so strong.  
             I could almost swear the damn thing was still...  AH!  It's 
             back!
    **Frasier:** Oh, my God, the tide must have washed it back in.  I knew 
             we should have taken their advice and stabbed some holes in 
             it.
      **Niles:** No.  I refuse to even contemplate something so disgusting.  
             We'll just row it back out, only this time we'll weigh it
             down with something.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, what about that hideous anchor lamp?
      **Niles:** Perfect.  We'll tie it to the peignoir's sash, it'll sink 
             like a brick. [_checks his watch_] Would you mind terribly 
             doing that alone?
    **Frasier:** Alone?!
    
    _Cut to - the interior as they come inside._
    
      **Niles:** Yes, I have to get ready.  Frasier, please, I beg you.
    **Frasier:** All right, Niles.  But the entire time I'm gone, you'd better 
             be singing my praises to Claudia Kynock.
      **Niles:** Done.
    
    _Chef Marcel comes from the kitchen._
    
     **Marcel:** Excuse me, where do you keep the...
      **Niles:** Chef Marcel, it's so nice to meet you at last!
     **Marcel:** You have been swimming?
    **Frasier:** Just a dip.
     **Marcel:** In your clotheses?
    **Frasier:** Well, it is November.  You know, it was so refreshing, 
             I think I'll go back for another.
      **Niles:** Don't forget your lamp.
    
    _He takes the anchor lamp to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, thank you.
    
    _Frasier goes outside with the lamp._
    
      **Niles:**[_off Marcel's look_] It's getting dark in that water.
    
    _He heads upstairs.  Fade out._
    
    **THERE FETE IS SEALED**
    
    _Scene 3 - The Beach House
    Fade in.  Niles, in his tuxedo is circulating around the living room 
    which is filled with people._
    
        **Niles:** Sebastian, you must try one of these truffled scallops.
    **Sebastian:** I'm allergic to bivalves, a good host would know that.
      **Claudia:** Don't mind Sebastian, he's just afraid you'll outshine 
               his geisha party.
        **Niles:** Now, now, no rivalries, we're all friends tonight.  And
               I'm sorry about the scallops.  In the future, I'll try to 
               cater more to your shellfish demands. [_moves off_]
    **Sebastian:**[_after a pause, then irritated_] I got that!
    
    _Niles grins at him, then notices Frasier coming down the stairs._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, thank God you're back.  I can open the deck?  People 
             are beginning to get suspicious.
    **Frasier:** I hauled it out as far as I could.  I just hope that lamp 
             is heavy enough.  Is Claudia here?
      **Niles:** Yes, and she's dying to talk to you.
    **Frasier:** Good.  Smell my fingers.
      **Niles:**[_sniffing_] Ooh, lovely.  Tubla root?
    **Frasier:** Jasmine.
      **Niles:** Really?  Everyone?  As you may know, I've arranged a small 
             meteor shower for our entertainment this evening. [_laughter_]
             So feel free to claim your spots now on the observation deck.
    
    _He waves them out to the deck, but stops Claudia on her way._
    
      **Niles:** Claudia.  This is my brother Dr. Frasier Crane.
    **Claudia:** Oh, well.  Just the man I wanted to meet.
    **Frasier:** Really?
      **Niles:** Well, now I should warn you, Claudia's in radio, so you're 
             probably in for more of that arm-twisting you've been 
             getting from so many of those other station owners.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my brother, the publicist.  Before long, he'll be 
             telling you about my two SeaBeas and my Broadcaster of the 
             Year award.
    
    _Cut to - the deck as the come out._
    
      **Claudia:** Well, now we don't have to talk all business.  But I do 
               want to mention that we may be replacing one of our 
               nationally syndicated hosts, The Happy Traveler.
      **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  The Happy Traveler. How's that coming?
      **Claudia:** Not well.  Unless they get more realistic with those 
               ransom demands, he's never coming out of that jungle.
    **Sebastian:** There certainly are a lot of gnats buzzing around out here.
      **Claudia:** Yes, there are.
      **Frasier:** Here, allow me.
    
    _He smacks his hand together over a bug.  The noise activates the 
    anchor lamp which is now on the beach with the seal._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, dear God!
    
    _He claps his hands quickly to shut off the light._
    
    **Sebastian:** There were no bugs at my party.
    
    _Sebastian smacks a gnat on his face, activating the lamp, Niles 
    claps it off._
    
      **Claudia:** What's that on the beach?
    **Sebastian:** I don't know, but it's wearing a boa.
      **Frasier:** No, no.  That's preposterous.  It's just a rock with some 
               seaweed on it.
    _Another guest smacks at an insect, the lamp goes on, Niles claps it 
    off._
    **Claudia:** Niles, there seems to be something with feathers flashing 
             at us.
      **Niles:** Yes, yes, that's my neighbor.  Don't clap, it just encourages 
             her.
    **Claudia:** Does anyone else smell something?
      **Niles:** I know what I smell! [_He takes a deep breath and chokes._] 
             Truffles!
    **Frasier:** Everyone, time for dinner.
      **Niles:** Yes, step lively.  Mm-mmm.  Truffles.
    
    _They herd everyone back inside and close the doors._
    
      **Niles:** All right, get out there and stab that thing.
    **Frasier:** No.  I'm sick to death of chaperoning that carcass.
      **Niles:** Well I can't do it, I'm the host.
    **Frasier:** Niles, because of that woman in there and a scrappy band of 
             Third World rebels, I am this close to getting a national 
             radio show of my own.  You have to do it.
      **Niles:** All right.  Get me a knife, close those curtains and don't 
             let anyone out on this deck until I come back.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
      **Niles:** Where's the damn thing gone to?
    
    _Frasier claps his hands and the lamp comes on._
    
      **Niles:** Got it, thanks.
    
    _He claps his hands and the light goes out.  Fade out.
    
    Scene 4 - The Beach House
    Fade in.  Frasier is on the sofa with Claudia._
    
      **Claudia:** I've listened to your show.  And what impressed me most 
               is your ability to focus.
      **Frasier:** Yes, well I'm very proud of that.  I try to give each of 
               my callers my complete, undivided... [_He notices 
               Sebastian headed for the deck._] Excuse me.  Would you 
               please just stay inside?  We're about to start dinner.
    **Sebastian:** You said that ten minutes ago.
      **Frasier:** Yes, so it's even truer now, isn't it?  Just sit down.  
               [_Frasier sits back down with Claudia._] I'm sorry.  Back 
               to my show.
      **Claudia:** I must say, I was wondering myself when we'd be eating.  
               It's getting late.
      **Frasier:** Well, Niles is in the kitchen, right now, trying to prod 
               Marcel along.  You know how it is with these perfectionists.
    
    _Marcel comes out of the kitchen._
    
     **Marcel:** I am waiting to serve.  Where is Niles?
    **Claudia:** You mean he's not with you?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.  You know, perhaps 
             he's upstairs making a phone call.  If you could just keep 
             everything warm, I'm sure he'll be down in a minute.
     **Marcel:** He'd better be.  I reheat for no one.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm terribly sorry about all these interruptions.  
             Now, let's get back to that job.
    **Claudia:** Well, you'd be in ninety-three markets...
    
    _Frasier goes to a woman headed for the deck._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, can I help you?
      **Guest:** I just saw a meteor.
    **Claudia:** Oh, have they started?
    **Frasier:** Please, everyone, stand back and witness the spectacular view 
             through this transom.
    **Claudia:** Can't we see them better outside?
    **Frasier:** No, no, it's much safer in here.  You see, you never know 
             where they might land.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Perhaps that's Niles.
    
    _Frasier opens the front door, two policemen are standing there._
    
     **McLean:** Hello, is Niles Crane here?  We're investigating a possible 
             homicide.
    **Claudia:** What?
     **McLean:** Your neighbor saw Dr. Crane and another man row out to sea 
             with a third party dressed in a nightie.  The men returned 
             alone.  We suspect they dumped the body overboard.
    **Frasier:** Oh... all right, now, now, there's nothing to be alarmed 
             about.  Please gentlemen, come in, you see, I can clear 
             this whole thing up.  You see, I was the other man in the 
             rowboat.  
    **Claudia:** You dumped a body overboard?
    **Frasier:** Well...
    
    _Gretchen rushes in._
    
    **Gretchen:** Thank God you're here!  I just saw a murder!
     **Claudia:** What?
    **Gretchen:** Dr. Crane was on the beach with his wife, Maris.  I recognized 
              her peignoir.  I could even smell her perfume.  He was 
              stabbing her again and again.
     **Frasier:** Ah, no, clearly this woman is delusional.  Listen, search 
              the entire house, I defy you to find one scrap of evidence 
              that there's been foul play here.
      **Marcel:**[_from the kitchen doorway_] My butcher knife has disappeared 
              from the kitchen.
      **McLean:**[_to his partner_] Go check the beach.
    
    _The other officer goes to the deck._
    
    **Frasier:** Please, people, I assure you there is nothing sinister going 
             on here.
    _The officer opens the drapes, revealing Niles standing on the deck, 
    wearing gloves and wiping blood off the butcher knife with his 
    handkerchief.  Noticing the officer, he throws them both over his 
    shoulder.  He comes in and the officer rushes to the beach._
    
      **Niles:** Hello, all.  Meteor shower's started.  Oh, excuse me.
    
    _He takes off his gloves and hands them to Sebastian._
    
     **Frasier:** Niles, there's been a little misunderstanding.  Perhaps 
              it's time you explained to everyone about the dead seal.
       **Niles:**[_laughing_] Dead seal?  At my Golden Apron dinner?  That's 
              enough bubbly for you!
     **Frasier:** Niles, they think you murdered Maris!
    **Gretchen:** I saw him stabbing her!
       **Niles:** Oh, I see what's happened!  Oh, this is funny!  Oh, you 
              are all going to laugh when you hear this.  I was simply 
              stabbing a seal.
     **Claudia:** You killed a seal?
       **Niles:** Oh, no, no, I didn't kill it, it was already dead when we 
              found it.
      **McLean:** You found a dead seal?
     **Frasier:** Yes.
      **McLean:** And it was wearing a peignoir?
     **Frasier:** Now that is ludicrous.  We put the pegnoir on it.
      **McLean:** And the perfume too?
     **Frasier:** Yes, of course.
      **McLean:** So you found a dead seal, dressed it in a peignoir, doused 
              it in perfume, and stabbed it?
       **Niles:** I told you you'd laugh.
    
    _The other policeman comes in with the torn, bloody peignoir._
    
     **Athanis:** I found this washed up on the beach.
       **Niles:** Well there, if that doesn't prove my innocence, I don't 
              know what does.
    **Gretchen:**_Gott im himmel_!  It's covered in her blood!
    
    _She collapses onto a chair.  Marcel comes out._
    
     **Marcel:** Dinner is served.
    
    _The guests head for the door, McLean stops them._
    
     **McLean:** Sorry folks, no one can leave.  This is a crime scene.
      **Niles:** Well, it certainly would be a crime if we missed that dinner!  
             Everyone, sit down!  There's place cards all around the table.
    **Athanis:** OK, gentlemen, let's go.
      **Niles:** Well, he said no one can leave.
    
    _He cuffs Niles, McLean cuffs Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Claudia, perhaps we can discuss that job tomorrow.  You know, 
             I've got some business cards in my breast pocket if you'd like 
             to fish one out.  No?  Fine, I'll just call you then.
      **Niles:** Officer?  You can't arrest me.  My wife is alive!  She's in 
             Antwerp, getting her elbows done!
    **Frasier:** Oh, give it up, Niles, even I didn't believe that one.
    
    _The police escort them out the door.  Fade out._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    The beach house is empty, the French doors at the deck swinging in 
    the wind.  With each slam of the door, the light, once again on the 
    beach, goes on and off.
