Niles goes to the other side of the room, takes a run-up and does the trick, admiring his work afterwards.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Guest Starring** ROSEMARY MURPHY as Carol Larkin JACK SYDOW as Alfred Larkin RANDY DONEY as Dr. MacLowery MIMI HINES as Mrs. Latimer BILL MOREY as Mr. Probst NINA MANN as Miss Finn FIONA HALE as Mrs. Hawkins JACK DONNER as Mr. Hawkins   * * *  ## Synopsis {kathy churay}     _ACT ONE  SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - EVENING_  Niles is irritated and disgruntled as he and Frasier return from dinner. As they recount their evening to Martin we learn that at the restaurant they were first served an inferior Pouilly Fuisse, then seated next to Donny and Daphne who were being very affectionate. Frasier switched chairs with Niles so he wouldn't have to watch, only be confronted a few minutes later with the spectacle of Maris coyly flirting with her new boyfriend over dinner to taunt Niles.  Niles is depressed about the whole evening and just wants to go home to the Montana.  Martin asks whether he can't afford to go back now, and Niles answers that he can except that Frasier persuaded him to sublet the apartment to a starchy dignified tenant who still has two months remaining on his lease.  His dejection is complete when Daphne comes in, beaming.   Apparently while Niles had hesitated to send back the inferior wine at dinner, Donny had not only sent back the same wine but also made a scene and got the restaurant to waive the bill for their entire meal.  Daphne goes off to her room saying how proud she is of Donny, and Niles moans that he just wants to go home.  Frasier agrees to call the tenant at the Montana and try to break the lease.  ****TAPS AT THE MONTANA****  Niles and Frasier are about to ring the doorbell when they meet Mrs. Latimer, a neighbor who observes that Niles is back from his tour. Niles replies that his sublet was able to move out early, and after she leaves Frasier inquires about the tour.  Niles tells him that he had informed his neighbors that he was going on an African lecture tour -- wouldn't have done to let them know the real reason he was moving out, and he hadn't wanted them to be able to contact him. They ring the doorbell and when there is no response they let themselves in with Niles's key.  Niles is thrilled to be home after four months.  \"I just want to close my eyes and savor the serenity!\"  But the serenity is short- lived as the sound of loud tap dancing echoes from upstairs. A figure dances into view on the parquet floor of the stair landing, then slides down the bannister to the living room to continue his dance routine.  It's Dr. McLowrey, a gray-haired man wearing a Walkman and doing an enthusiastic tap routine all over Niles's parquet-covered living room floor.  Frasier asks when McLowrey had taken up tap dancing, and the doctor replies that he adopted it years ago to keep from going crazy.  Too late, Niles observes.  The last straw for Niles is when McLowrey leaps onto one of Niles's antique chairs and tips it over in a dance routine reminiscent of both Fred Astaire and Niles's fencing scene in \"An Affair To Forget\" when he tips over the couch.   Niles is panicked at the potential damage to his apartment, and Frasier tries to remind the doctor about the neighbors. McLowrey replies that the neighbors are sourpusses, always complaining, and taps merrily off to the kitchen.  Just then the doorbell rings and Niles greets three members of the building's tenants' board:  an older couple, the Larkins, and a sour-looking grayhaired man named Mr. Probst.  Probst informs Niles that they abhor noise in the building and the board is leaning toward rescinding his lease.  Niles tries to protest but Probst tells him that he has a heart problem and the other tenants need quiet.  He cautions Niles that there will be a board meeting the following evening, and if he were Niles, he wouldn't plan on unpacking.  Niles is in shock as they leave.   There is a very subdued party in progress as Niles hosts the 10 or so members of the tenants' board, all of whom are wealthy-looking senior citizens.  Daphne and Frasier are helping Niles at the punchbowl as Daphne tells Frasier he was nice to help his brother by organizing the party.  Niles replies that it was the least Frasier could do after subletting the apartment to \"Bojangles the Loon\".  The doorbell rings and Daphne admits Roz and Martin.  They go over to the punch bowl and Roz tells Niles how surprised she was to get his last-minute invitation.  He tells her the caterer cancelled and orders her to open the wine, cut up some limes and hang up the coats. Roz is miffed but Frasier enlists her help and she agrees if Frasier will pay for the babysitter.  Frasier agrees and Roz goes off to hang up her coat.  Martin cynically inquires what his role will be -- dishwasher? Frasier tells him that there are several unattached women his age who \"might just take a shine to an old debonair dog like yourself.\"",

        "text": "** \"I'm just a piece of meat to you guys!\"  Just then Daphne returns to the punchbowl from her rounds of serving drinks.  She starts to help Frasier but is distracted when her earring slips off and slides down her blouse.  She retrieves it and remarks that she was grateful it didn't end up in the punchbowl.  Meanwhile Niles is making lame jokes with the party guests and failing miserably.  He heads for the kitchen in desperation.  As he enters Frasier is shooing Baby away from the kitchen table where she is sampling the canapes.   Niles returns her to her perch as she pelts him with slang taught to her by Niles's neighbors from the Shangri La.  To her \"Stuff it, Niles!\" he replies, \"Oh, don't tempt me.\"  And back to the living room he goes with Frasier to deliver the food.  One of the female guests collars Niles to inquire who Martin might be.  Niles tells her and she goes off in hot pursuit.  Roz complains that one of the elderly men pinched her.  When Frasier doubts how hard an arthritic old man can pinch, she demonstrates on his chest. Niles goes into a panic because the guests are not mingling or having a good time, and Frasier reassures him, fleeing into the kitchen for more food.  Frasier enters the kitchen to find Daphne with her back turned and Baby lying dead on the kitchen table in the middle of a tray of canapes.  Frasier gasps and asks how it happened.  A stunned Daphne replies that Baby must have eaten some of the hors d'ouvres [_I can never spell that and I'm not looking it up now._]  Niles comes in for more appetizers and Frasier throws a towel over Baby to keep Niles from seeing her.    ****POLLY WANT A STOMACH PUMP?****   Niles wants to know what has happened, and Frasier flees to the living room to collect the appetizers and leaves Daphne to deliver the bad news.  Frasier races around the living room collecting food trays and grabbing appetizers out of the guests' hands.  He returns to the kitchen.  Niles is giving Baby CPR, but it's too late.  He's shocked and sad but not really heartbroken as Frasier returns with the food and they begin trying to guess which appetizer has gone bad.  Was it the pate? The mayonnaise?  Meanwhile Frasier begins dumping canapes into the garbage.  A guest enters the kitchen and complains that she needs something to blot the wine she's spilled on her dress.  She tries to take the towel that covers Baby, but Daphne hands her a piece of bread instead and she leaves, blotting her dress.  As Daphne picks up Baby there is a small clattering sound, and Daphne discovers her loose earring which has fallen out of Baby's mouth. Apparently that's what has killed her.  They are relieved to know the food hasn't gone bad and they try to stop Frasier from dumping all the food into the garbage, but it's too late.  Now Daphne will have to re-make all the food.  Roz bursts into the kitchen and Daphne hastily stuffs Baby into the freezer and closes the door.  Roz complains about the guests and Niles moans that his party is doomed, but Frasier won't let him give up.  He shoves Niles back into the living room to stall the guests while he and Daphne make more food.  As Niles returns to the living room Mr. Probst comes up to Niles complaining about the lack of food.  \"What kind of game are you playing here?\"  As he begins to deny playing games Niles gets inspired and declares that they should all play a game.  One guest suggests a game of \"Murder\".  All the guests will get slips of paper, one of which reads \"Murderer\".   While the other guests hide he will pick one victim to kill.  Frasier comes in and volunteers to be the detective who solves the crime.  Frasier turns out the lights and the guests dutifully hide.  Mr. Probst can't read his slip of paper, and Roz helps him to read the word \"Murderer\" on his piece of paper.  Probst grumpily informs Roz that she's dead, and she lies down on the floor complaining about the game.  When Frasier turns the lights on he finds Roz lying next to Mr. Probst, who is face down on the floor with his arm over Roz.  Roz protests but Frasier informs her the murder victim can't talk, and so she subsides.  The guests come out of hiding and Frasier tries to stall them as they complain about the boring game and the lack of food.  He suggests turning off the lights again so the murderer can strike again, and off go the lights as the guests return to their hiding places.  Roz flags down Frasier from her place on the floor, asking if the murderer can commit suicide. It turns out that Mr. Probst is not feigning unconsciousness but has actually died while playing the game. Roz is appalled to think that she had been lying next to a dead man. Niles comes in from the kitchen to receive the news and can't believe it. He is in despair over his chances at staying at the Montana now, but as usual Frasier has a plan.   Roz and Frasier nearly panic, but Frasier suggests they simply bring the other guests out to the kitchen and have Martin call his friends at the police station to remove the body quickly. Meanwhile, Roz must lie down next to Probst and continue to play the part of murder victim till the police come.  Roz at first refuses till Frasier bribes her with airfare to her vacation destination the followng month.  Martin comes in after having made his phone call and agrees to play the murderer.  He goes off to the kitchen with one of the guests who has been annoying him.  Frasier turns on the lights and brings out the other guests, dragging them off to the kitchen to expound on the identity of the murderer.  He keeps it up in spite of the guests' complaints until he sees that the police have taken away the body.  Finally the guests are bored and rebel, exiting back to the living room where they remark on Mr. Probst's absence.  Niles tells them Probst didn't feel well and went home.  One of the other guests remarks that he had been planning to vote in favor of Niles just to annoy Probst, and the others agree.  They take a quick vote, welcome Niles back to the Montana, and  beat a hasty retreat out the front door to escape the ghastly party.  Roz complains about the lack of hard liquor, and Frasier tells her Niles keeps a bottle of vodka in the freezer.  Niles is assuring his departing guests that there will be no further noise from his apartment when Roz's bloodcurdling scream from the kitchen announces that she has located Baby's final resting place in the freezer door.
