At first he shakes his head at them, but he then decides to try it himself.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Special Guest Star** SAUL RUBINEK as Donny  **Guest Starring** SHARON MADDEN as Mrs. Woodson   * * *  ## Quick Synopsis {kathy churay}    _ACT ONE  Scene One - Radio Station - Afternoon_  Frasier enters Roz's booth congratulating her on a good show, only to find her with a pile of mail order catalogues.  She asks his opinion and at first he thinks she's choosing a gift for his birthday, and he warns her against a gift like last year's.  \"You said you loved Pagliacci!\" Roz protests.  \"Yes,\" Frasier replies, \"the opera, not the little porcelain crying clown figurine.\"  But the gift isn't for him, it's for Niles, who pulled strings to get Alice on the waiting list for a very good preschool.  Frasier jokingly tells her not to get Niles a porcelain Pagliacci -- he already has one.  Roz throws a catalog at him as he leaves, smirking.  ****Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Dead****   Frasier is reading on the couch as Martin comes in from a visit with his friend Hank, a security guard at a jewelry store.  He tells Frasier he and Hank were watching the security monitor and saw Donny buying an engagement ring.  Frasier is shocked and wonders whether they should tell Niles, who will be crushed.  But Martin says that it's none of their business.  They shouldn't tell Niles, and they definitely shouldn't tell Daphne.  \"Tell Daphne what?\" she inquires, coming in from the laundry room with her basket.  She quickly leaps to the conclusion that her mother's health checkup is bad news, and works herself nearly into a frenzy until Martin blurts out the truth.  Daphne is shocked at first, then ecstatic at the thought of getting married at last.  \"I'm going to be a missus!\"  And she runs off to her room jubilantly.  Frasier tells his father that they are going to have to prepare Niles, who is on his way over to the apartment at that moment.  They adjourn to the kitchen, still talking, and Martin advizes Frasier not to tell Niles in the apartment so he won't go to pieces in front of Daphne.   Frasier agrees that he'll tell Niles at the restaurant they're going to for dinner.  Martin warns him not to take Niles to \"one of those fancy wine bistros that you guys love.  News like this calls for hard liquor and big glasses.\"   As he heads back to the living room Frasier remarks that it's best Niles hear the news from him and not from Daphne.  \"Hear what from Daphne?\" asks Niles, coming in the front door. Frasier won't tell him and says Niles has to wait till they get to the restaurant.  Niles laughs and refuses to be teased, and heads for Daphne's room to ask her himself.  They head him off, and Frasier is about to tell him when Martin jumps in with a story that Daphne's mother is dying.  Daphne comes in and Niles gives her a hug to comfort her, only to be confused by Daphne going on and on about the impending \"big day.\"   Frasier suggests that Daphne might want to be alone and tries to rush Niles out of the apartment, but Daphne can't help but rhapsodize over the wonderful news that Donny is going to ask her to marry him.   Niles reacts stoically and Frasier looks sympathetic as Daphne insists that all three of them must sit up front with her family on the big day, since they are family to her. Niles pulls himself together to hug Daphne and tell her how thrilled he is for her, and she rushes off to her room again.  None of the three Cranes has much to say.  Finally Martin tells Niles how sorry he is, but Niles brushes him off.  Maintaining a brave front he begs off dinner with Frasier, saying he needs to be alone, and leaves.  Frasier asks him to call if he needs him.  Martin pities Niles, but Frasier tells him Niles is stronger than they give him credit for. Just then the phone rings, and Frasier answers it and says, \"Hold the elevator, I'll be right there.\"  He hangs up and heads to the front door as the phone rings again.  Martin answers it with, \"Hang in there, son, he's on his way.\"  As Frasier opens the front door we can see Niles standing with his head against the elevator door, clutching his cell phone numbly.    Niles is writing in a journal as his secretary Mrs. Woodson knocks at the door on her way out for the evening.  She hands him a bag that someone named Roz Doyle had dropped off earlier while he was in session.   Niles thanks her and sets it aside, taking up his journal again as she leaves. A moment later there is another knock at the door, but this time it's Daphne.   She apologizes for dropping by without calling.  She wanted to talk to Niles privately.  Niles cautions her that it's not appropriate for him to act as her therapist, but he'd be happy to give advice as a friend.  Daphne tells him she's not sure she can marry Donny, that there's someone else she's meant to be with.   Niles asks her who it is and she can't say.  Niles thinks she's just being shy, but she cautions him not to laugh at her -- she's seen the man in a psychic vision. He insists she must tell him about it, omitting nothing.  She starts telling him in detail about her vision of the ceremony -- her mother's dress, her brothers' suits, the guests.  Niles gently hurries her along until she finally says that at the part of the ceremony where the vicar asks if anyone objects to the marriage, a man stands up and says he is the true love of her life.  Niles smiles and says he thinks he knows who the man is, but Daphne doesn't see how that could be. She herself couldn't see the face of the man standing in the shadows, only the red bow tie he was wearing.  Daphne says how awkward she feels, telling her psychic visions to a psychiatrist, since she's sure Frasier would laugh at her.  But this means, of course, that she's going to have to turn down Donny's proposal, and stop dating him since it would be unethical to lead him on.  Does Niles think that's crazy?  Of course Niles doesn't at all. Though he knows he's taking advantage of her, he can't help but be happy she's going to break up with Donny, and enjoy the hug she gives him as the scene ends.   _ACT TWO  Scene One - Frasier's Living Room - Early That Evening_  Martin is watching TV as Frasier enters from the bedroom.  Eddie is lying on his back on an end table, watching the television upside down as Frasier heads into the kitchen.  Daphne comes in and Martin tells her that Donny called and will come by about 8:00.  Does she think he'll ask her to marry him tonight?  Daphne tells him she hopes not; she's planning to break up with Donny tonight.  She tells him about her vision and cautions him not to tell Frasier.  \"Don't tell me what?\" Frasier asks as he comes in from the kitchen. Martin blurts out her news and Daphne is forced to reveal that she's had a vision.  Frasier wonders whether it's not unwize to break up with Donny on the basis of a vision.  Daphne insists that his brother had a different opinion, that breaking up with Donny was her only choice. Niles knows she has a gift, she insists, and storms out to the kitchen.  The doorbell rings and Fraizer expects it will be Donny, but it's Niles, wearing the inevitable red bow tie.  He tries to be casual, but Frasier caustically informs him that he and Martin have already heard about Daphne's vision and his advice, and Frasier is astonished at Niles's lack of integrity.  Niles takes the tie off protesting that all Daphne needs is a nudge to realize he is the man for her -- why else would she come to him for advice?  But Frasier is genuinely angry at Niles for not seeing that the visions must represent a fear of commitment, not psychic ability.  Daphne comes in and Frasier tries to get her to talk about her vision, but Daphne is defensive and afraid of being mocked.  Frasier gently tries to raize the question of when she's had the visions in the past -- was it usual at a crucial juncture of relationships?  No, Daphne insists, though it did happen when her first boyfriend proposed.  She felt there was someone better waiting, and there was - - Clive.  Frasier points out that she dumped Clive, too, but she refuses to discuss it and retreats to the kitchen.  No fear of commitment there, Frasier observes sarcastically to Niles. Niles insists that it's possible that Daphne's previous boyfriends were just wrong for her, but Frasier points out that not only is Niles not being a good psychiatrist -- he's not being much of a friend, either.  Niles appeals to Martin, who sides with Frasier. Niles is forced to reconsider and goes into the kitchen to talk with Daphne.  Daphne is making tea as Niles tells her he's reconsidered his advice of that afternoon.  Perhaps her visions are really produced by fear of commitment and she would be breaking up with Donny for the wrong reasons. Daphne gets angry at him and tells him he's just like his brother, thinking she's pitiable because she believes in visions. But his pity isn't going to change her belief in her visions.  She is clearly hurt and goes off to her room to collect herself as the doorbell rings.  Frasier lets Donny in.  Daphne comes in and tries to get him to go out for their date.  Donny says he has something to talk to her about.  The Crane men try to get out of the room, but Donny insists they stay to hear what he has to say.  The three of them sink resignedly to the couch and are forced to listen as Donny makes a touching, heartfelt proposal to Daphne.   Daphne is very moved and for a moment it's not clear what she wants to do, but then she happily accepts his proposal.   Niles, Frasier and Martin sit looking stunned till Donny chides them for their long faces and they get up to congratulate Donny and Daphne.  Niles acts genuinely happy for them, but quickly beats a retreat to the kitchen, followed by Frasier.  In the kitchen there is mostly silence as Frasier collects glasses for a champagne toast and Niles stands grief-stricken at the counter. Martin comes in and pushes Frasier out with the champagne so he can have a moment alone with Niles.  He tells Niles that he would give anything to fix this for him.  Niles admits it's his own fault, not saying anything to Daphne about his feelings, then saying the wrong thing and causing her to accept Donny's proposal.  Martin comforts him that he has done the right thing and that he can count on that from Niles.  Daphne comes in to give Niles a big hug and thank him for talking some sense into her.  Niles wishes her the best in a choked voice, and Donny comes in to hug him, too.  Niles even manages to return Donny's hug for his number one client.   Martin is searching for his TV Guide as Daphne comes in in her bathrobe. Donny is in the other room, on the phone with Daphne's parents.  Daphne starts to help Martin with the search, and is looking under a chair when she straightens up in shock.  She's just had another vision.  The same man is in this one, only this time he has a dragon.  She admits the visions must be about her fears after all.  \"Imagine spending the rest of my life looking for some poor bloke with a dragon!\"   Niles shuffles tiredly through the living room in his pajamas, turning off lights for the night.   He spots the bag Roz gave him and roots through it looking for the gift.  \"Oh, Roz!\" he exclaims, and lifts out the figure of a carved dragon for a moment before he puts it back in the bag in disgust.
