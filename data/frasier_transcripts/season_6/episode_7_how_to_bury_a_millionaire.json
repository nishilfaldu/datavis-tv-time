DHP was great, although his faked enthusiasm for his new place was a little too realistic. Highlights included the car chase and touring the apartment. The plot wasn't exceptional, and there weren't any memorable lines, but some displays of \"brotherly love\" (the Noel Coward pen) and plot transgression make this a lot better than the last two shows. **C-** ",

I know he's always a strange little man, but I just couldn't take the facial cream and the babbling lake. However, I must praise part two, it was glorious. The whole \"Shangri-La\" apartment scene were wonderful. It showed Niles in his usual state of denial. There were some great gags like \"Jimmy put on pants to come up here.\" I couldn't stop laughing when Niles walked to the door in the Hawaiian shirt and sat on the lazy-boy just like Martin. It was great how he changes his role model from his mother to his father. **B+**   * * *  ## Transcript {nicholas hartley}    _Act One.
