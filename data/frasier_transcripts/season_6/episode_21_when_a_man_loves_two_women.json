So Daphne goes into the room to get Martin's yellow bowl that originally was Eddie's.  Martin refuses to give it to her until he eats his last bran flake. Daphne then rushes into the kitchen with it and fills it with water. She then lays it down in front of Eddie who merrily drinks from it.   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Special Guest Stars** VIRGINIA MADSEN as Cassandra AMY BRENNEMAN as Faye   * * *  ## Quick Synopsis {kathy churay}     _ACT ONE  Scene One - Frasier's Apartment - Morning_  Martin and Daphne are in the kitchen, maneuvering around one another with the balletic grace and split-second timing of long practice. They've obviously got it down to a science, including the same old ritual complaints and Martin feeding the dog a forbidden piece of toast.  They move to the living room with breakfast and Frasier emerges from his room in a cheerful mood.  He reveals that he has asked out Cassandra again, the same women he dated ambiguously in the Valentine's day episode.  Martin and Daphne jump to the obvious conclusion and start comforting him over his failed romance, only to be embarrassed when Cassandra herself emerges from the bedroom in a dressing gown.  She is full of flattery and compliments for Martin, who is thoroughly charmed, though she all but ignores Daphne. Frasier suggests Daphne make breakfast for Cassandra, but Daphne just glares and Cassandra goes off to the kitchen to make it herself as Daphne does a dead-on imitation of Cassandra's flattery, complete with American accent.  Niles comes to the door in his squash outfit, full of reproof for Frasier at not even being dressed for their game.  Frasier tells him they will have to reschedule because he had a date last night.  Niles too leaps to conclusions and starts comforting Frasier.  \"A brisk game of squash will be the best thing for you.  I can't think of a better way to lift your spirits.\"  As Cassandra emerges from the kitchen, Frasier remarks dryly, \"Keep thinking.\"   ****Of All The Coffee Joints In All The Towns In All The World...****   Frasier is having coffee with Roz and smugly recounting the latest chapter of his romance with Cassandra.  Roz is a bit nauseated by him but tries gamely to stay interested.  Finally Frasier asks about her life, and Roz excitedly tells him the plans for Alice's first birthday party the following Sunday.  Frasier just looks at her blankly and Roz gives up trying to keep his attention, changing the subject back to Frasier and his love life.  Just then Faye Moskowitz happens by.  Frasier greets her with a big hug and Faye tells him she just got back from a month in France.  She had left him a message but Roz forgot to deliver it.  Roz sees which way the wind is blowing and gets up to leave, giving her seat to Faye.  Faye happily accepts and goes outside to put money in her parking meter.  Frasier panics and says he can't have coffee with Faye because he's dating Cassandra.  Roz asks him whether he and and Cassandra have agreed to date each other exclusively, and Frasier has to admit they haven't.  In that case, Roz advises, he's under no obligation not to see other women, although he could keep things platonic with Faye if that would make him feel better.  He asks her how to tell Faye such a thing, but Roz has never had to do that and can't think of the words.    Martin and Daphne are making breakfast again, doing their usual graceful ballet around one another.  As they move to the breakfast table Frasier enters in his dressing gown, and Martin asks him if he had a date the night before.  In answer Frasier holds up two coffee cups instead of his usual one, and Martin compliments him on his choice of women.  \"Women like Cassandra don't come along every day.\" Daphne is amused when the woman who comes out of the bedroom in one of Frasier's bathrobes is not Cassandra but Faye.  Faye greets them and compliments Daphne on her new haircut.  Daphne beams and offers to fix her breakfast, but Faye declines and heads for the bedroom to get dressed.  Frasier is following her with the coffee when the doorbell rings, and it's Cassandra with a bag of pastry.  Frasier nervously begs off and tells her that he has a squash game with Niles, so Cassandra starts to leave, only to make a side trip to the powder room.  Frasier grimly admits Niles, who has shown up for the rescheduled squash game. ",

Frasier keeps hugging her and playing for time until he can see through the front door peephole that Faye has boarded the elevator and left  Then he practically shoves Cassandra out the door.  Niles teases him about his plethora of women and Frasier defends himself by saying that each of them appeals to a different side of his personality -- Cassandra to the passionate, earthy side and Faye to the cultural, arty side.  Martin makes it clear he prefers Cassandra and Daphne gives him a hard time about his susceptibility to flattery.  Niles attempts to help Frasier decide by offering to flip a coin, but stops at the last minute and forces Frasier to admit he wants one woman to be the winner of the coin toss.  Frasier finally comes clean -- Cassandra is the one he prefers, to Martin's delight and Daphne's consternation.  Martinc compliments Frasier on his ability to make a tough choice, saying that he himself can't decide between two kinds of jam.  Niles offers to help Martin decide and flips the coin, hitting himself in the head and causing one of his patented disastrous Niles pratfalls.  Martin and Daphne don't bat an eye.   _ACT TWO  Scene One - Frasier's Apartment - The Next Morning_  Martin and Daphne are doing their morning ballet, only this time Martin's favorite yellow cereal bowl has broken in the dishwasher and he has to use a different one.  This is enough to throw off his entire morning ritual, and he and Daphne keep bumping into one another till Daphne offers to find another yellow bowl somewhere around.  She pushes Martin out of the kitchen and grabs Eddie's yellow water bowl to give it a quick wash.  Martin asks Frasier how his breakup with Faye had gone the day before, but doesn't need to wonder for long as Faye once again appears in Frasier's bathrobe.  Niles shows up at the front door ready for squash, but promptly turns around and leaves in disgust when he sees Faye.    Niles is having coffee as Frasier bustles in to apologize for missing the squash game for the third time.  Niles is trying to understand Frasier's logic in spending the night with Faye, and Frasier explains that his conversation with Faye had just led him to understand that he and Faye had a deeper connection than with Cassandra.  In fact, he has asked Cassandra to meet him at the cafe so that he can tell her goodbye. Just then she comes into the cafe, and Niles makes himself scarce.  Cassandra sits down and Frasier begins the conversation tensely. Cassandra clearly thinks he's going to call things off and tells him not to feel bad -- she's been dating someone else.  Frasier tries to complete his speech but is badly thrown by Cassandra's news.  In fact, he's so overcome with jealousy that he ends up asking her to date him exclusively.  Cassandra is pleased and begins to chatter on happily, as in voiceover we hear Frasier's doubts begin to surface about her every little flaw.  She goes off to make a phone call to her other boyfriend and call off that evening's date,  and Niles comes over to the table, having seen the whole thing from across the room.  Niles gave Frasier a hard time about his sudden change of heart. Frasier, of course, insists that Cassandra is the only woman for him, and calls Faye his cell phone to break it off with her right then. She isn't home, so he leaves a message cancelling their dinner plans for that evening and telling her ominously, \"We need to talk.\"  But as soon as Cassandra returns to the table his doubts return, and  he breaks things off with her.   Frasier comes to Faye's apartment and asks her to date him exclusively.  Faye is surprised and happy and tells him that she will.  They sit on the couch and Frasier's doubts begin running audibly through his mind again, only this time they were immediately followed by Faye's doubts about Frasier, which we can also hear. \"Are those new shoes again?  He has more shoes than I do...\" ",
