    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - TV Station._
    [_N.B. Basically, you have to know a bit about the background of the 
    airing of this season of "Frasier."  "Frasier" used to be shown at 
    10:00pm in America, however when "Seinfeld" finally went off the air 
    "Frasier" was used to fill the slot at 9:00pm.  Remember that 9:00pm 
    is prime time television.  It is the time when most people watch the 
    TV, and the people of "Frasier" were very concerned about their 
    ratings.  It was a big move and this first scene reflects this with an 
    in-joke._] 
    _So, the first picture we see is Frasier in front of the camera which 
    at first could be interpreted as him talking about the new time slot:_
    **Frasier:** Before we begin, I'd like to say how honoured I am to be 
             taking over this slot.  Obviously, I have some rather big 
             shoes to fill - my predecessor here was much beloved.  But 
             I have never been one to shrink from a challenge and I'm 
             sure we'll enjoy many happy years here together in my new 
             home.  Now, today on "Medical Minute"...
    
    _The camera pulls back to show that actually Frasier is auditioning 
    for a TV show after he got fired in "Sweet Dreams."_
    
     **Frasier:** We're going to be tackling the sticky subject of...
    **Director:** Dr. Crane, great audition.
     **Frasier:** Really?  That's all you need?
    **Director:** I think we have a good idea what you're all about.
     **Frasier:** Excellent.
    **Director:** Er, we'll be in touch.
     **Frasier:** I'm sure you will.
    **Director:** Next, please!
     **Frasier:** Oh, formalities?  Yes, I understand.  You know, perhaps 
              I'll just take a walk around the station.  Check out the 
              dressing rooms, introduce myself to a few people.  Say, 
              you know, is there a sign-up list for the softball team? 
              I'm sure that Frasier "Slugger" Crane's gonna be an asset 
              to this station in more ways than one!
    
    **DENIAL**
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    It is early in the morning and Frasier is playing the piano as Martin 
    enters in his dressing gown._
    
     **Martin:** Morning, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, good morning, Dad.
     **Martin:** A little early for the piano, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm sorry about that.  You know I woke up this morning 
             thinking about that operetta I've been writing.  You know, 
             the one about Robert and Elizabeth Browning.  I think, well, 
             I had to get right to it.
     **Martin:** Well, that's what you get living in a big city: If it's not 
             the horns waking you up it's someone writing an operetta 
             about the Brownings. 
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I'm pretty sure I've solved the problem.
     **Martin:** Good for you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** But you know, I'd have to hear it to be sure.
     **Martin:** I'll bet that.
    _Frasier obviously wants him to sing it with him but Martin doesn't 
    want to.  Eventually, he angles around him and they sit at the piano._
    **Frasier:** Oh come on, Dad, it'll only take a minute, I just want to do 
             this one section.
     **Martin:** Oh, all right, but I'm not doing the accent!
    **Frasier:** Come on.  All right, we'll take it right here.
     **Martin:** Fine.
    
    _He strikes up the piano and begins singing:_
    
    **Frasier:** What is it that you feel...
     **Martin:** Love?
    **Frasier:** That fear which you conceal...
     **Martin:** Love?
    **Frasier:** That powers that you heal...
     **Martin:** Love?
    **Frasier:** Reveeeall.  Take me in your arms...
    
    _Martin interrupts and Frasier stops the piano._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll just have to sing it with Niles later.
     **Martin:** Oh, that'll cheer me up. [_Walks to table and picks up sketches_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, be careful with those sketches.
     **Martin:** Sketches?
    **Frasier:** Yes well, you know I've been telling you that I'm redecorating 
             the apartment, I thought why not just design my own furniture?
     **Martin:** Boy, Frasier, you know you've been taking on a lot of big 
             projects lately.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, any minute now that phone will ring with another 
             job offer, and this blessed little hiatus will be over.  
             I want to have achieved as many of my life's ambitions as 
             possible.  Gee, frankly Dad, you should take up a project 
             or two.
     **Martin:** Me?  What are you talking about?  I'm doing stuff all the 
             time.  Why, just this weekend I taught Eddie a great new 
             trick.
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah, come on, I'll show you. [_Walks over to Eddie by chair. 
             Eddie jumps down, Martin kneels_]
     **Martin:** It starts out that I point a gun at him.
    **Frasier:** I like it so far.
     **Martin:** Then I say "Freeze punk, it's all over."
    
    _Martin waits for Eddie - no response.  Martin looks at Frasier 
    and tries again._
    
     **Martin:** It's all over! [_no response_] Oh come on Eddie, you're 
             supposed to go like this. [_Martin rolls over on back_]
    **Frasier:** Now all we have to do is teach Eddie to say "It's all over."
    _Daphne enters through the front door, struggling with a large, 
    heavy box._
     **Daphne:** Can someone help me here?
     **Martin:** What is all that?
     **Daphne:** Some books Dr. Crane sent for me to get from storage.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's research I'm doing for a novel I'm planning.  
             Gee Daphne, I was beginning to wonder what was taking 
             you so long.
     **Daphne:** Well, excuse me.  But I did have to move 3 crates, a rowing 
             machine and a cast-iron bath tub out of the way first.
    
    _Frasier picks up a book from the shelf next to the phone._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, look at that.  The only book I really wanted was on the 
             shelf already.  You'll have to take these back down. [_Bell 
             rings from kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, that's my duck!  Thank you, Daphne.  When you're 
             done with that, I need you to run some errands for me.  I 
             need a very sturdy lemon-zester, some more music paper, some 
             potting soil and an easel.
     **Daphne:** I'd be happy to. 
    _Niles appears, starting to enter behind Daphne._
     **Daphne:**[_muttering_] And then maybe after that I could draw a bath, 
             strip you naked and scrub you with a loofah.  Would that be 
             all right, Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:** Yes.
    
    _Daphne turns around, looks surprised and laughs.  So does Niles._
    
     **Daphne:** I didn't even see you standing there. [_Daphne exits_]
     **Martin:**[_Gets up from chair_] Hey Niles, can I talk to you about 
             something?
      **Niles:** Yeah, just one second, Dad. 
    _Niles shuts the door, holds onto the handle, waits for a moment and 
    sighs.  Then he turns to face Martin._
    
      **Niles:** OK.
     **Martin:** Well, it's about Frasier.  Ever since he got fired, he's been 
             so weird.  All these projects he's got going...
      **Niles:** Yep, don't worry, it's normal.  He's simply in a state of 
             denial. [_Sits on arm of chair and begins to tie shoelace._]
     **Martin:** Denial about what?
      **Niles:** About getting fired.  People like Frasier's whole identities 
             revolve around their job.  The loss of the job is like a... 
             is like a death.  And they cope with it in the same way they 
             would cope with a death, by going through a series of stages.  
             First one's denial; usually that's followed by anger; then, 
             er...
    **Frasier:**[_Comes out from kitchen, and calls loudly_] I've done it! 
             Escoffier's most difficult dish done to tangy perfection!  
             You know, sometimes I think I missed my calling by not 
             becoming a gourmet chef. [_Exits back to kitchen_]
      **Niles:** See we're still in stage one.
    **Frasier:**[_From kitchen_] Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey Frasier, you ready for our squash date? [_Frasier exits 
             kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Oh gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to cancel - I've 
             been cooking all morning.
      **Niles:** Oh, what for?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually I'm holding a little picnic for the KACL 
             employees and their families.  As you may recall I did get 
             them all fired. [_Frasier laughs_] So I was just hoping to 
             make amends by serving up a little duck a l'orange and an al 
             fresco mea culpa!
     **Martin:** You know, people like chips at a picnic too.
    
    _The phone rings, Frasier says, "excuse me," and answers._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Ah, yes, Bebe.  Yes, yes.  Oh yes, the television job.  
             Oh, what a relief.  Thank you, bye-bye. [_Hangs up_]
     **Martin:**[_excited_] You got it?
    **Frasier:** No, thank goodness.  That job starts tomorrow - I have got 
             things to do.
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Sorry?  My God, you sound just like Dad.  I am going to get 
             another job.  The people of this city need me.  I am a 
             beloved Seattle institution. 
    _He exits into the kitchen._
     **Martin:**[_Sitting at breakfast table_] A couple more days like this 
             and he's going to be _in_ a beloved Seattle institution.
    _FADE TO:_
    **ANGER**
    
    _Scene Three - Seattle Park.
    Roz, Bulldog and Frasier are in the park talking over a picnic table. 
    People in background walking and talking._
    
    **Bulldog:** Wait till you hear this, I got a job today. [_Roz and Frasier 
             congratulate him_]
    **Bulldog:** You've got to rub me for good luck.
        **Roz:** Where?
    **Bulldog:** Well, start at my knee and work your way up.
        **Roz:** Where's the job?
    **Bulldog:** Oh-oh-oh, all right.  It's that new all-sports station.  I got 
             the breakfast slot.  I even came up with a slogan, "Coffee, 
             eggs and Bulldog."
    **Frasier:** Sounds like some sort of Malaysian Happy Meal.
    
    _Gil enters between Frasier and Bulldog._
    
        **Gil:** A word of caution on the hummus.  To be avoided - as a leper 
             would avoid a magic tea-cup ride.
        **Roz:** Gil, Frasier made that.
        **Gil:** Oh, I'm so sorry.
    **Frasier:** That's quite all right.  I understand you need to flex your 
             critical muscles while you're between jobs.
        **Gil:** Oh good, then you might enjoy this one: "After sampling your 
             [_???_], I was tempted to describe your entire Middle Eastern 
             buffet as 'The Sorrow and the Pita.'"  Oh, who's got a pencil, 
             I've got to write that one down! 
    
    _Gil exits, Frasier is laughing.  Tooty enters._
    
      **Tooty:** Hi everybody. [_Others greet her_] I just got the most exciting 
             news today: they just picked up my story time theatre on 
             public television. [_Others congratulate_] Talk about living        
             happily ever after, eh?  Chi-ching!
    
    _CUT TO: Frasier and background.  Kenny enters._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, Dr. Crane
    **Frasier:** Oh, well hi, Kenny
      **Kenny:** Great party.  Oh and by the way, I picked something up for 
             you on my way to work today.
    **Frasier:**[_Surprised and jealous_] Work?
      **Kenny:** Yeah, yeah.  They took me back at my old job. 
    _He whistles, then picks up a pita loaf and takes a bite._
      **Kenny:** I was passing the bus stop and... Excuse me a sec. 
    _He turns away, spits out the food, and hides it in his shirt pocket._
      **Kenny:** Anyway, they were about to paper over your poster, so I peeled 
             it off for you. [_he hands the rolled-up poster to Frasier_]
    **Frasier:** Well, that is quite a keepsake. [_Begins to unroll it_].
      **Kenny:** Don't mention it.  Oh, and by the way, the poster under yours 
             was an old radio guy. [_Thinks._] Er, a Dr. Earl.  Who was he 
             again?
    **Frasier:**[_Thinks_] You know, I'm sorry, I don't recall.
      **Kenny:** Yeah, I'm the same way.  Once they're off the air, who 
             remembers them? [_Laughs._] 
    _Frasier laughs also, but is struck by the comment.  Kenny sees someone 
    else, and leaves.  Frasier rolls up the poster.  Roz enters from left._
        **Roz:** Do you realize that we're just about the only people here 
             without a job?
    **Frasier:** Roz...
        **Roz:** If we don't get this Top 100 spot, there may not be any left.
    **Frasier:**[_Comforting_] Roz, I've told you: We have nothing to worry 
             about.  Come on...
    
    _CUT TO: wide view, Frasier calls to everyone._
    
    **Frasier:** Everyone, if I could have your attention, please?  We have 
             of course planned some activities for today's little get-
             together, and I'd like to start with one for the children.
    
    _Frasier moves along with group of children to a pi?ata hanging from 
    a tree.  A large group watches from a short distance._
    
    **Frasier:** Now what we have here is an authentic Mexican pi?ata. 
             [_Hands pole to blindfolded child._] The object is to take 
             the stick, and give it a little whack. [_Gently hits pi?ata._]
    
    _CUT TO: Gil on his mobile:_
    
        **Gil:** Oh, good for me.  I just got the Top 100 job.
    **Frasier:**[_Incredibly annoyed_] Oh well, good for you, Gil. [_Holds stick 
             with child_] Yes, you're going to want to give this little 
             fellow a good crack.  Otherwise... 
    
    _He takes the stick, the child moves away._ 
    
    **Frasier:** You know, maybe I ought to get this started for you.  
             Otherwise the candy will never come out. 
    _He starts hitting the pi?ata very hard.  The group cowers and 
    withdraws._
    **Frasier:** Everybody knows that keeping something locked up inside is 
             never good for anyone, is it?! 
    _He thrashes the pi?ata very hard repeatedly, until the stick breaks.  
    Roz and Bulldog look on.  Then his mobile rings.  He pauses, and takes 
    out the phone from his trouser pocket to answer it._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Yes, Bebe.  We did hear the news, and how thrilling 
             for Gil.  Could you hold, please?
    _He looks at the phone, then drops it on the ground.  He starts to 
    stab at it with his broken stick.  The phone breaks up into many 
    pieces.
    
    End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two._
    
    **BARGAINING**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles and Martin are in the lift, going up to Frasier's floor.  
    Martin is sorting through mail and singing, and beginning to 
    annoy Niles._
    
     **Martin:** What is this I feel, love.  That fear that makes me conceal, 
             love.
      **Niles:** Dad...
     **Martin:** Was I doing it again?  Damn.  Was I doing it before Mrs. Walsh 
             got off?
      **Niles:** That's why Mrs. Walsh got off. [_Martin acts annoyed._] 
             So, what's Frasier doing?
     **Martin:** Ah, he's getting weirder.  He beat up a pi?ata yesterday.
      **Niles:** Isn't that what you're supposed to do to a pi?ata?
     **Martin:** Not like this.  They found a jawbreaker on the other side of 
             the highway.
      **Niles:**[_thinks, then_] Oh, well, this is good!  It means he's reached 
             the anger stage.  In due course he'll go through bargaining, 
             depression, and finally acceptance.
     **Martin:** What's bargaining?
      **Niles:** Oh, well, it's like when a person makes a deal with God to 
             spare their life.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, I know all about that. 
    _The lift reaches their floor, and they exit._
     **Martin:** I remember right after I got shot, I said, "God, if I promise 
             never to drink another bottle of Ballantines, will you let me 
             get through this?"
      **Niles:** You still drink Ballantines.
     **Martin:** Not in bottles, baby.
    _Martin unlocks the door and enters the apartment, which is filled with 
    all sorts of plants, and serving dishes full of fruit.  A waiter is 
    walking round with a serving tray.  Frasier is stood by the breakfast 
    table._
    **Frasier:** Oh, you're just in time, I'm throwing a party for my fan club.
     **Martin:** Here?
      **Niles:** Is there some problem with the bridge they normally meet under?
    **Frasier:**[_Laughs_] Very amusing, Niles. [_Serious_] You see, I've been 
             doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and last night... I did 
             something which I haven't done since I was a very little boy. 
             I got down on my knees on the bedside, and I prayed for 
             guidance. 
    
    _CUT briefly to Niles and Martin, looking concerned._ 
    
    **Frasier:** And I asked God, "What can I do to get my old life back?"  
             And the answer came, "take better care of your fans."
     **Martin:**[_Long pause_] God told you that?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I have taken my public for granted.  I take weeks before 
             I answer my fan mail, if I answer it at all.  I've been a bad 
             celebrity.   Well, no more! [_Goes over to pour drink._]
     **Martin:** I didn't even know you had a fan club.
    **Frasier:** Well, they meet on the internet, and I visited their website 
             yesterday for the first time. [_Brings hand up to head, and 
             shakes it_] Bad celebrity!  But I invited them all here, and 
             you know what?  They were so grateful that before long, I 
             mean, my God, suddenly they were proposing that they hold a 
             massive rally in my honor, demanding that I return to the 
             airwaves.  You know, I think that it's safe to say that 
             someone is already working in mysterious ways. [_Laughs._]
     **Martin:** Someone sure as hell is. [_Walks over to kitchen._]
     **Waiter:**[_To Frasier_] Some crab puffs, Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, you just keep them away from me.  It won't be long 
             before I'm back in the public eye, and I've got to remain 
             tight and trim.
    _Daphne enters, struggling to hold a large cardboard box.  Her hair is 
    ruffled, and she is carrying a torch._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne. [_Walks over to collect box._]
     **Martin:** What you got there?
     **Daphne:** Oh, just a box of Dr. Crane's publicity photos from the 
             storage cubby. 
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] Thank you.
     **Daphne:** This flashlight sure came in handy.  Helped me to find that 
             box way up at the top of that old bookcase. [_Shuts door._] 
             And when that thing flew in my hair, I had something to beat 
             it to death with. 
    
    _Martin gives Niles a look.  Doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, good Lord, our first arrivals.  God, I've got to check 
             the food.  Daphne, will you run to the store for me?  I need 
             some felt-tip pens to sign these pictures with.  Do you mind? 
             [_Runs into kitchen._]
     **Daphne:** Sure, what else have I got to do? 
    
    _Daphne answers the door to Aaron, a young teenager, and Doris, 
    a middle-aged woman with glasses._
    
      **Aaron:** Hi, Daphne. [_Turns to woman, excited,_] It's Daphne!
     **Daphne:** Hello.  Have we met?
      **Doris:** We know you from the magazine.
      **Aaron:** April '96, _Seattle Monthly_ , "At home with Dr. Frasier Crane."  
             You were wearing an orange flower dress.  And your hair was 
             different then.
     **Daphne:** Oh, how creepy.  Do come in. 
    
    _They enter.  Frasier walks up to greet them, Doris looks surprised._
    
    **Frasier:** Come in, come in. [_Shakes Doris's hand,_] I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
      **Doris:** Wow!  Hi, Doris Butley.
    **Frasier:** Doris... [_Lets go, and shakes Aaron's hand._]
      **Aaron:** Aaron Fitch.
    **Frasier:** Aaron... Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.  You know, 
             perhaps I should introduce these people to you. [_Turns to 
             Niles and Martin.  Guests both look surprised._]
      **Doris:** Oh, we know who they are.
     **Martin:** And now, where we live.
    _CUT TO: Daphne standing by the door.  George is waiting there.  He is 
    old, and shy, and carrying a camera._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh don't be shy, come in, come in.
    _George runs up to Frasier, and points the camera in his face and takes 
    a picture._
    
     **George:** This is great, this is great!
    **Frasier:** I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, it's a pleasure to meet you.
     **George:** This is great, this is great!
    _George puts his head next to Frasier's, and takes a picture of the two 
    of them.  Frasier is stunned slightly.  Cut to Aaron talking to 
    Niles._
    
      **Aaron:** It's cool, isn't it?  Your brother having his own club.
      **Niles:** Yeah, well, seeing all of you, I sort of wish I had a club 
             myself.
    _Frasier is holding up cards.  All three fans are over by Eddie._
    **Frasier:** You know, perhaps you'd like to fill out these name tags 
             while we are waiting for everyone else to come.
      **Aaron:** Who else is coming?
    **Frasier:** Well, the rest of the fan club.
     Dorris: This is the fan club - the three of us!
     **Daphne:**[_By door, exiting and laughing,_] Well, I'll be off to get 
             those pens now! [_Exits and closes door._]
    **Frasier:** You know, perhaps you should all help yourself to some food. 
             Um, Niles, may I have a word with you, please? 
    
    _He walks to the kitchen.  George is staring at Niles, who is unsure 
    what to do.  Frasier calls from kitchen:_]
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!
    
    _Niles slowly edges to kitchen.  Frasier, Niles and three waiters are 
    in the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** I can't let them do this rally.  Three kooks marching round 
             in a circle, you know what that'll do?
      **Niles:** Make them very dizzy very fast.
    **Frasier:** Make me a laughingstock - I'll never work in this town again.  
             I mean, I've got to stop them.
     **Waiter:** Sorry to interrupt, but I need to carve the second turkey.
      **Niles:** No fighting over drumsticks at this party.
    **Frasier:** Stop it! [_Knocks Niles on the arm_
    _They both exit into the living room._
    **Frasier:** How's everyone out here?
     **Martin:**[_Sitting in his chair,_] Oh, great.  We were just talking 
             about the rally.
    **Frasier:** Really, Dad?  Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
     **Martin:** They had it this afternoon.
      **Aaron:** Right in front of city hall.
      **Doris:** It couldn't have gone better.  George even stopped traffic 
             by lying across the road on a psychiatrist's couch.  The 
             cameramen sure loved that.
    **Frasier:** Cameramen?
      **Doris:** Oh, what are we doing?  It's almost time for the 6 o'clock 
             news!
      **Aaron:** You're going to love this, Dr. Crane!
    
    _Doris turns on the TV.  Music plays for news._
    
    **Frasier:**[_To waiter standing behind him,_] Excuse me, what have you 
             got there? 
     **Waiter:** Er, still the crab puffs.  Shall I get you something else?
    **Frasier:**[_Taking whole tray,_] Yes please, bring me some spring rolls. 
    
    _Waiter exits.  Frasier starts eating the food off the tray.  
    Niles gives Frasier a look._
    
         **TV:** Now on the lighter side, did you ever ask yourself, "What if 
             they held a rally and nobody came?
     **George:** This is great, this is great! [_Takes picture of TV_]
    
    _Frasier and Niles look shocked.  Frasier then calls to kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Forget the spring rolls, bring me the freakin' turkey!
    _FADE TO:_
    **DEPRESSION**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment
    Frasier is in the kitchen, leaning into the fridge.  He has obviously 
    gained weight._
    
     **Martin:** Uh, Frasier...
    **Frasier:** Yeah, Dad?
     **Martin:** Do you think we could talk to you for a second in the living 
             room?
    _Frasier comes out of the fridge with a plate of food, and is eating it 
    with his hands - not very Frasier!_
    **Frasier:** Yeah, sure.  Gee, sounds kind of serious.
     **Martin:** It is, kinda...
    
    _Both exit to the living room, Frasier eating on the way.  Niles and 
    Daphne are sat on the couch, Roz on the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Yeah, what is it?  Oh Roz, I didn't hear you come in.
     **Martin:** I think you had the blender going. [_Both walk over to Martin's 
             chair._] Er, Frasier, we're wondering, do you think you might 
             be depressed?
    **Frasier:** Depressed?
        **Roz:** Well, we've all noticed that you've put on weight lately. 
             [_Cuts to Frasier, who has a large tummy,_] we're worried that 
             you might be eating excessively.
    **Frasier:**[_Sits down in Martin's chair, continuing to eat._] Well, gee, 
             maybe I've gained a pound or two, but it's nothing I can't 
             handle.
      **Niles:** So you think you've got everything under control.
    **Frasier:** Absolutely.
     **Martin:** It's time, Roz.
    
    _Roz gets up and puts a video in the machine._
    
        **Roz:** Remember when I had that babysitter that was stealing from me, 
             so I had to put in that hidden camera?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Roz:** And remember when you babysat for me?
    **Frasier:** What about it?
        **Roz:** Just watch this. 
    _She is standing behind Frasier, and starts video with the remote._
    _CUT TO: shot of the TV, with video playing.  It is in black and white, 
    and of Frasier with baby Alice._
    
    **Frasier:**[_v.o:_] Well, baby Alice, I think it's meal time.  Let's see 
             what's on tonight's menu. [_Gets up and moves around._] Ah yes, 
             strained beef and lima beans.
    **Frasier:** Oh all right, point taken.  So I've put on a pound or two- 
             but the camera adds ten! 
    
    _On the TV:_
    
    **Frasier:**[_Tries to feed baby, but she won't take it._] Come on, yes, 
             now, its very good.  Here, I'll show you. [_Eats spoonful 
             of food._] Um, oh my.  Alright, here, now it's your turn.
    
    _CUT TO: real Frasier, feeling uneasy with food in his hands._ 
    
    **Frasier:**[_on TV_] No, still?  You know, that's not even a proper 
             spoonful.  Let's get you a full one. [_eats that spoonful._]
    
    _CUT TO: Frasier, looking round at Niles.  Niles looks at Frasier._
    **Frasier:**[_on TV_] That's a nice big one.  You know what, let's try 
             something else.  Oh, some pureed chicken and yams. [_Takes 
             spoonful_] Come on now, open up.  Open up!  Now well, if 
             you're not hungry, you're not hungry. [_eats spoonful._] 
             My, well.  They taste pretty good together.  Let's try 
             that. [_Eats double spoonful._]
    
    _Frasier, really uneasy, shuffles in chair._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on TV:_] Tell you what, what's that you have in your baby cup 
             there?  Is that apple juice?
    **Frasier:** Oh all right, enough!  Turn it off.
    
    _Roz turns off the video._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I guess maybe you're right, I am depressed.  What of it?
     **Martin:** Well, you know, we're just trying to help you get to, you know, 
             the next stage.
    **Frasier:** Stage of what?
      **Niles:** Frasier, you know, I think you're dealing with the loss of 
             your job as many people do with a death.  Only you've got 
             yourself stalled in depression, and I think you're going to 
             stay there until you let yourself grieve.  For everything 
             you've lost. [_Frasier looks annoyed,_] Your job, your friends,  
             the money, your reputation. [_Frasier seems to grudgingly 
             agree._] 
        **Roz:** You've got to let it out, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Well, I thank you all very much for your concern, but you 
             know what, if I was repressing anything...
    _Frasier tries to get up from out of the chair, but needs help from 
    Niles and Martin._
    **Frasier:** I would certainly know it.  The only thing that I need to let 
             out is these so-called one-size-fits-all lounge pants. 
    
    _He exits into the kitchen.  The others all rise and move about._
    
        **Roz:** Well, that went well.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, we gave it a shot.
     **Daphne:** What do we do now?
      **Niles:** Well, we can't push him.  If he's not ready, he's not ready.
    
    _Frasier lets out a cry from the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** What was that?
        **Roz:** Was that Frasier?
    **Frasier:**[_comes into living room,_] If anyone's hungry, there's a 
             freshly made Monte Cristo in the waffle press.
     **Martin:** Oh great, thanks, Fras.
    
    _Frasier lets out a little cry, and stops._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, are you all right?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Roz:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** I am quite sure.
    
    _Frasier rests against the wall, facing away from others, and pauses. 
    Others look on, concerned._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, you're not famous any more.
    
    _Frasier lets out a big cry.  Niles goes up to him and leads him down 
    towards the couch._
    
     **Martin:** What did you do that for?
      **Niles:** No, no, dad, he needed a push.
     **Martin:** Yeah, but look at him, this can't be good.
      **Niles:** Oh, it is good.  Let it out, Frasier, let it all out. 
    
    _Frasier flops onto the couch, still crying._
    
      **Niles:** That's good, that's good.  Let it all out. 
    
    _Frasier continues to cry.  Niles provides comfort for some time._
    
      **Niles:** OK, Frasier, that's probably enough now.
     **Martin:** How much more can be in there?
      **Niles:** OK, all right, Frasier.  That's probably enough now, OK. 
             [_To Martin:_] I don't think I can get him to stop.
     **Martin:** This is sickening.
     **Daphne:** What are we going to do?
     **Martin:** Somebody get that Monte Cristo in here. [_Daphne runs to get it_]
        **Roz:** Frasier, it's all in how you look at things.  Look at my 
             life...
    **Frasier:**[_Wailing still_] No career, no relationship, no hope.
        **Roz:** You can say the same thing about me.
    **Frasier:** I was talking about you! [_Roz hits him gently._]
     **Daphne:**[_Bringing over waffle_] Dr. Crane, my Grammy Moon used to say... 
             [_Frasier yells loudly,_]
     **Martin:** What are you trying to do, kill him?
     **Daphne:**[_pointing at Roz_] Don't blame this on me.  She brought the 
             bloody tape over!
        **Roz:** Oh, so now this is all my fault.  You saw that tape.
     **Daphne:** I saw your baby, too.  She could stand to miss a meal or two.
        **Roz:** She's a healthy baby!
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it, stop it all of you. [_Wailing still_] There is no 
             hope.  It's over.  Over. [_Sobs_]
    
    _Eddie enters, who rolls on his back.  Others watch him._
    
     **Martin:** Look at that!  I'm so proud of you, boy.
    **Frasier:** Oh dad, you're just saying that!
    _FADE TO:_
    **ACCEPTANCE**
    
    _Scene Three - Caf e Nervosa.
    Niles is sat at his table when Frasier walks in looking very trim and 
    very smart.  He sits with Niles._
    
     **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
       **Niles:** Frasier, please join me.
     **Frasier:** Thank you very much. [_to waitress:_] I would love to have...
    **Waitress:** Wait!  Mochaccino, extra whipped cream and a Linseed Torte, 
              right?
     **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Not anymore!  Can I have a non-fat latte please?
    **Waitress:** Hey, didn't you used...
     **Frasier:** Yes, yes.  I used to be on the radio, with any luck I will 
              be again.  Thank you for remembering, it does help.
    **Waitress:** I was just gonna say, didn't you also used to get a bear claw? 
     **Frasier:** Off you go!
    
    _She goes to fetch the coffee._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I just have to say "Bravo!"  You're slim, well-
             adjusted, you've really turned things around, haven't you?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's easy once you hit rock bottom... and bounce! 
             [_laughs_] Thank you, Niles.  I couldn't have done it without 
             you.
      **Niles:** I did nothing you wouldn't have done.  And you'll be happy 
             to know my own life is on quite the upswing as well.  I just 
             got back from a meeting with Maris and her lawyers.
    **Frasier:** And?
      **Niles:**[_grinning_] I think this divorce is going to go very smoothly!
    
    **DENIAL**
    _End of Act Two_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier is having breakfast and Eddie is on his hind legs begging 
    for food.  Frasier does Martin's "It's all over" trick on him and 
    it works.  Eddie lays down.  Frasier, pleased with himself, blows 
    on his finger like a gun.
