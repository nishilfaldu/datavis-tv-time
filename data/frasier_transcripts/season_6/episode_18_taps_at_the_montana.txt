    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin is sat in his chair reading the paper when Niles and Frasier 
    enter._
    
     **Martin:** Hey boys, how was dinner?
      **Niles:** Oh, let's just say when I picked my lobster out of the tank 
             I had no idea that he was in for a better evening than I was.
     **Martin:** What happened?
    **Frasier:** Well, it started off well enough.  First they seated us at a 
             superb table, much better than the one next to us - where, 
             unfortunately, they sat Daphne and Donny.  
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez.
    **Frasier:** They were being very affectionate, of course: whispering, 
             laughing, holding hands...
      **Niles:** This in a place where people were trying to eat.
    **Frasier:** Well, in an attempt to make things better I suggested that 
             Niles and I switch seats so that he could face the other 
             table.  Of course, only moments later they seated Maris 
             there with _her_ new boyfriend.  Also being affectionate.
      **Niles:** Grooming each other like spider monkeys!  She was deliberately 
             taunting me, playing the same coquettish games we used to play 
             in restaurants: batting her eyes and coyly hiding behind her 
             breadstick.  And then to top it all, the Pouille Fousse we 
             ordered was a grave disappointment.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well I urged him to send it back, but no, he didn't want 
             to create a scene in front of Daphne.
      **Niles:** Not that she would have even noticed, the way Donny was 
             feeding her forkfuls of risotto, as if she had lost her 
             arms instead of her mind, what is she doing with him?!
     **Martin:** Well, some days it doesn't pay to get out of bed.
      **Niles:** Well, at the Shangri-La, the highlight of my day is getting 
             out of bed, so I can slam it back up into the wall!
     **Martin:** How long are you gonna stay there?  You can afford to go back 
             to the Montana now, can't you?
      **Niles:** Yes, but thanks to Frasier there's a tenant living there!
    **Frasier:** May I remind you that you begged me to find you a sublet - 
             Someone austere and dignified enough not to offend your 
             starchy neighbors?
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'm not trying to blame you, it's just that my whole 
             world has crashed down around me and I want to go home.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry Niles, he's still got two months left on his 
             sublet.
     **Martin:** Can't you give him a call, lean on him a little bit?
    **Frasier:** Dad, the man has a lease, I can't very well call him up and 
             ask him to move out.
    _Then Daphne enters from her night with Donny.  They all greet her._
    
     **Martin:** How was dinner?
     **Daphne:** Wonderful. [_to the brothers_] You should have come over and 
             joined us. 
      **Niles:** Oh well, it looked like that you had enough to contend with, 
             what with your [_sotto voce_] table's fork shortage.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Donny takes such good care of me.  You know, after you 
             left, I made the tiniest comment about not liking the Pouille 
             Fousse and he sent it back.  That snooty wine steward argued 
             with him but Donny made a bit of a scene with the owner and 
             the next thing you knew, our entire meal was on the house. 
             [_laughs_] I've never been prouder of him. 
    _She exits.  Niles falls against the arm of the couch with a pathetic 
    whine._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I wanna go home.
    **Frasier:**[_picks up phone_] I'll call Dr. MacLowery.
    _FADE OUT_
    **TAPS AT THE MONTANA**
    
    _Scene Two - Niles's Apartment.
    In the hallways of the Montana, Niles and Frasier are standing 
    outside his apartment.  Mrs. Latimer comes to greet him._
    
    **Latimer:** Dr. Crane, you're back.
      **Niles:** Yes, Mrs. Latimer.  Fortunately my sublet was able to move out 
             early.
    **Latimer:** I trust your tour was a success?
      **Niles:** A triumph.
    **Latimer:** Good, take care.
    _Mrs. Latimer leaves as Frasier processes the conversation between her 
    and Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Tour?
      **Niles:** I could hardly let these people know where I was living. 
             [_presses doorbell_] I told them I was on a lecture tour of 
             Africa so they wouldn't try to contact me.
    **Frasier:** Ah! [_then_] You know, Niles, maybe he isn't here.  Maybe we 
             should just let ourselves in.
    
    _Frasier opens the door and he steps in with Niles.  Niles is taken 
    aback by seeing his home again._
    
      **Niles:** Oh... I'm home.  Oh, I can already feel the last four months 
             dropping away.
    **Frasier:** Yes, soon Africa will be just a memory.
      **Niles:** I just want to close my eyes, [_does_] and savor the serenity...
    
    _Then all of a sudden tap dancing is heard offstage._
    
      **Niles:** What the hell is that?!
    _Dr. MacLowery comes onto the scene tap-dancing, with headphones on, 
    and sails down the banister._
    
    **Frasier:** It's Dr. MacLowery!
    
    _He carries on dancing.  Niles screams._
    
      **Frasier:** Dr. MacLowery!  What are you doing?
    **MacLowery:**[_takes off his headphones_] Oh, that was a ball change, 
               leading to a riff drop.  You've got to "Lick it & Stick 
               it." 
    
    _He starts dancing again, until Frasier stops him._
    
      **Frasier:** When did you take up tap dancing?
    **MacLowery:** Oh, years ago.  I figured if I didn't dance, I'd go crazy.
    _Then he begins tap-dancing again, fluttering his arms wildly, and then
    dancing all over the room like a mental patient._
    
      **Niles:** I'm not sure he caught it in time.
    _MacLowery then takes a run-up and does that little trick where you jump 
    on the chair and tip it over.  Niles screams at this.  Then MacLowery 
    does a step routine that involves kicking the toes of his tap shoes  
    against the little step below the dining table._
    
        **Niles:** Ooh, baseboard, baseboard!
      **Frasier:** Dr. MacLowery, please - the neighbors!
    **MacLowery:** Tell me about it!  Why, those bunch of sourpusses.  All they 
               do is complain! [_then_] Sunshine-rain!
    
    _MacLowery taps into the kitchen.  The doorbell sounds.  Niles opens 
    the door to Alfred & Carol Larkin [_last seen in "To Kill A Talking 
    Bird"_] and Mr. Probst._
    
      **Niles:** Oh well, look who it is, it's the tenants' board come to 
             welcome me home.  Carol and Alfred Larkin, you remember 
             my brother, Frasier.  Oh, and Mr. Probst.
     **Probst:** See here, Crane.  We abhor noise in this building. 
      **Niles:** Oh, I couldn't agree more.
    
    _To which the tap-dancing starts up again in the kitchen._
    
     **Alfred:** What do you call that?
    **Frasier:** I believe that was "Lick it & Stick it"!
      **Carol:** This has been going on for months.  We would have contacted 
             you if we had known how to.
      **Niles:** Well, I am sorry but Dr. MacLowery....
     **Alfred:** Dr. Crane, I'm afraid the board is leaning toward rescinding 
             your lease.
      **Niles:** What?  Why?
     **Probst:** Because you're a menace, Crane.  You always have been.  You 
             have something of a reputation in this building, what with 
             all the raucous parties you've hosted.  I'm not a well man.  
             I have a serious heart problem and I demand quiet, we all do.
      **Niles:** Well, Mr. Probst, I assure you...
     **Probst:** Uh-uh.  We're having a board meeting tomorrow evening in 
             which we intend to discuss your situation, and if I were you 
             I wouldn't plan on unpacking.
    
    _Niles is taken aback as the three leave._
    
      **Carol:** Nice seeing you again.
    
    _Niles closes the door.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Niles's Apartment.
    It is the evening of the meeting and everyone is milling about.  
    Frasier, Daphne and Niles are at the front.  Daphne is tending 
    to the punch._
    
     **Daphne:** It was good of you to go to all this trouble for your brother, 
             Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, in a way I felt responsible.
      **Niles:** Oh, really?  I don't why.  Just because you sublet my 
             apartment to Bo Jangles the Loon?
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
     **Daphne:** Ooh!  I'll get it. [_she does_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, will you relax?
      **Niles:** How can I?  In an hour these people will throw me right out 
             of my home.
    **Frasier:** Which they won't do if you show them a good time at this 
             little reception.  A couple of drinks, some food, some witty 
             conversation, they'll realize what an asset you are to this 
             building.
    
    _Daphne brings over Roz and Martin.  Daphne takes some drinks to the 
    guests as Roz goes forward to the brothers._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, guys.
      **Niles:** Hey, Roz.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:**[_sarcastic, looking at old people_] Great party, Niles!  I was 
             a little surprised to get your last-minute invitation.  You're 
             not trying to set me up with anybody, are you?
      **Niles:**[_laughs_] Don't be ridiculous.
        **Roz:** Good.
      **Niles:** You're here because the caterer cancelled. [_takes her coat_] 
             Now listen, I need you to open the wine, cut up some limes 
             and hang up this coat.
        **Roz:**[_peeved_] You actually think that I'm so hard-up for a night 
             out that I'd spend an evening pushing drinks in "God's Waiting 
             Room"?
      **Niles:** Shush!
    **Frasier:** Roz, please!
        **Roz:** You're paying for the babysitter.
    **Frasier:** All right, done.
    
    _Roz takes the coat away.  Martin goes to his sons._
    
     **Martin:** What am I, the dishwasher?
    **Frasier:** No, Dad, you were invited because... well, it just wouldn't be 
             a party without you.  Although there may be a few women here 
             who are unattached, who might just take a shine to an old 
             debonair dog like yourself.
     **Martin:** I'm just a piece of meat to you guys, aren't I?
    
    _Martin wanders off as Daphne comes back.  Her earring falls off and 
    down her front._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, there goes that damn loose earring again!  Thank goodness 
             it didn't fall in the punch bowl.  We don't want someone 
             choking on it, do we?
    **Frasier:** Yes, although nothing says "party" like a tracheotomy.
    
    _Meanwhile, the people are listening to Niles._
    
      **Carol:** You must tell us all about your African tour, Dr. Crane.
     **Alfred:**[_sarcastic_] Yes, did the local people actually enjoy your 
             lectures?
      **Niles:** Well yes, quite a bit.  Except of course for the pygmies.  
             Most of it went right over their heads. 
    _Niles laughs but the joke falls silent on the rest.  The doorbell 
    sounds._
      **Niles:** I'll get it.
    
    _Niles opens the door and lots of people come in._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, the rest of the board, pleased to see you.
    **Latimer:** Dr. Crane, while you were on the subcontinent did you happen 
             to spot any rare African water fowl?
      **Niles:** Just one, but it was already spotted!
    
    _Again, no one even raises a giggle at the joke._
    
      **Niles:**[_responding to nothing_] I'll get it.
    
    _Niles exits to the kitchen where he finds his pet bird, Baby, 
    nibbling the food.  Frasier is shooing it._
    
    **Frasier:** For God's sake, Niles, will you do something with this damn 
             bird? 
      **Niles:** Onto your perch. [_picks her up and puts her on her perch_] 
             Here you go.  Over here.
       **Baby:** Niles sucks.
      **Niles:** The boys at the Shangri-La used to love teaching you things 
             like that.  So tiring.
       **Baby:** Bite me, Niles.
      **Niles:** Right back at you.  Frasier, please hurry with the hors 
             d'oeuvres, the guests are already hostile towards me.  
             I'm not going to win any points by starving them.
       **Baby:** Stuff it, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, don't tempt me!
    
    _Niles exits with some nibbles as Mrs. Latimer catches him._
    
    **Latimer:** Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    **Latimer:** Who is that distinguished-looking man over there?
    
    _We see that it's Martin covering him face with a gardening book.  
    He looks nervous._
    
    **Latimer:** I've been trying to catch his eye but he's far too engrossed 
             in that gardening book.
      **Niles:** Well, that's actually my father, Martin.  Dad? [_no response_] 
             Don't mind him, he's painfully shy.
    **Latimer:** Oh, I know just how he feels.  I'm a bit of a shrinking violet 
             myself. [_calls loudly_] Martin!
    
    _She walks off to him as Roz comes to meet Niles at the same time 
    Frasier does._
    
        **Roz:** Do you see that obnoxious old lecher?
      **Niles:** Well, you're going to have to be a lot more specific.
        **Roz:** The one in the blue jacket, I'm this close to slapping him.
      **Niles:** Wait, wait, wait, that is Mr. Hawkins.  He is the vice-
             president of the tenants' board. 
        **Roz:** Well, I don't care who he is, he just pinched me.
    **Frasier:** Roz, please, the man is eighty and arthritic.  How hard can 
             he pinch?
    
    _Roz demonstrates by pinching him._
    
    **Frasier:** Ow!
      **Niles:** It's not working.  People aren't talking, they're not 
             mixing....
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Stop it, stop it.  The party's just starting, 
             everything's going to be just fine.
    
    _Roz tries to pinch him again._
    
    **Frasier:** Don't you touch me!
    
    _Frasier enters the kitchen where Daphne is pottering._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne, how are those other... 
    _He trails off.  On the table is Baby, upside down and apparently dead._
    **Frasier:** Baby?
    
    _Daphne turns round and notices the bird._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God! [_feels it_] This bird is dead.  How did this 
             happen?
     **Daphne:** She must have eaten some of the hors d'oeuvres.
    **Frasier:** You mean the ones I've just served to Niles's guests?
      **Niles:**[_entering talking to someone outside_] You are very welcome!
    
    _Frasier quickly covers the bird with a cloth before Niles turns 
    around.  Niles is smiling.  Daphne and Frasier, however, are 
    horrified._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'm so sorry, I completely overreacted.  People 
             really perked up once they saw those appetizers of yours.   
             You know, I think the Niles Crane party curse has finally 
             been laid to rest. [_noticing their faces_] What?
    _End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two._
    
    **POLLY WANT A STOMACH PUMP?**
    
    _Scene Four - Niles's Apartment.
    The act starts from where the first act left off.  Niles is in the 
    kitchen and reacts from Frasier and Daphne's horrified faces._
    
      **Niles:** Will somebody please tell me what happened?
    **Frasier:** I'm going to let Daphne tell you.
    
    _Frasier takes a sharp exit out of the room._
    
      **Niles:** What is it?
     **Daphne:** I don't mean to alarm you but there's something wrong with 
             the hors d'oeuvres.
      **Niles:** What?  How do you know?
     **Daphne:** A little bird told me.
    
    _Daphne reveals the dead bird under the cloth and on Niles's scream 
    she covers it again.  Meanwhile, in the room Frasier is quickly 
    taking back the hors d'oeuvres._
    
    **Frasier:** Sorry, I forgot the garnish.  Just dreadfully embarrassed 
             about this... give me that!  Thank you very much.  It's just 
             chef's prerogative. [_quickly takes one out of Roz's hands 
             which is just about to enter her mouth_] Roz!  For God's sake.
    
    _And back in the kitchen..._
    
      **Niles:** Did you see how it happened?  Anything?
     **Daphne:** Well, I did hear her last words but... I don't think they'd 
             be of much comfort to you.
    
    _Frasier enters with the collected hors d'oeuvres._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, I'm so sorry.  My God, the mayonnaise must have 
             gone bad, or the cranberry, or the pate. [_begins binning them_] 
      **Niles:** Which one did she eat?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.  Daphne, smell her beak! [_Daphne reacts._]
    
    **Frasier:** Alright, Niles, are you all right?
      **Niles:** Yes, I just need a moment.
      **Carol:**[_o.s_] Oh, Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:** That's long enough.
    _Niles covers Baby just before Carol Larkin enters with a stain on her 
    jumper._
    
      **Carol:** Excuse me, I'm afraid I spilt punch on my dress, I need a 
             towel.
    _Carol reaches to grab the towel covering Baby.  Daphne stops her._
    
     **Daphne:** No.  You're much better off using...
    
    _She looks at Niles, who hands her a piece of bread.  She reacts, 
    but pretends it's what she meant._
    
     **Daphne:**...yeah, this bread.  It's much more absorbent!
      **Carol:** Really?
     **Daphne:** Yes.  That's why they call it nature's sponge.
      **Carol:** Alright. [_uses it and laughs_] It's working.
    
    _Carol exits._
    
      **Niles:** Alright, what do we do now?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, you get rid of Baby, I'll get rid of this tainted 
             food.
      **Niles:** But we still have a room full of hungry guests with nothing
             to serve them.
    
    _Daphne begins clearing up.  She picks up Baby and Daphne's earring 
    drops out of her mouth._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh God, look at that!  She must have swallowed my earring, 
             that's what killed her. 
      **Niles:** Oh, that means we don't have to destroy the hors d'oeuvres.
             Frasier, Frasier, stop!  Are there any left?
    
    _Frasier brings up the plate with one crab puff on it._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, we're in luck.  This intrepid little crab puff has 
             survived.  Now all I need is a very sharp knife and sixteen 
             toothpicks.
        **Roz:**[_o.s._] Niles!
    _Daphne quickly stuffs Baby into the fridge as Roz enters with a piece 
    of wet bread._
    
        **Roz:** I'm really getting tired of these people.  Some lady just 
             handed me a piece of wet bread. [_hands it over_]
      **Niles:** Oh, this party is doomed.
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, listen.  Don't panic, we've got everything we need 
             to make more hors d'oeuvres.  All we need is time, you get out 
             there and stall.
    _Niles exits into the living room.  He crosses to Mrs. Latimer._
    
      **Niles:** Mrs. Latimer, can I get you some punch?
    **Latimer:** Yes, your father went to get me some... but that was quite a 
             while ago.
      **Niles:** Allow me.
    **Latimer:** By the way, where is that adorable bird of yours?
      **Niles:** Um, she's resting.  Travel really takes it out of her.
    **Latimer:** You didn't take her with you to Africa, surely?  
      **Niles:** Well, she has family there.
    
    _Mrs. Latimer wanders off with the punch as Niles meets Mr. Probst._
    
      **Niles:** Mr. Probst, having a good time?
     **Probst:** Look here, Crane, if you're not going to feed us we might as 
             well take the vote right now. 
      **Niles:** No, no, no, please.
     **Probst:** I mean, you bring the hors d'oeuvres, you take the hors 
             d'oeuvres away... what kind of a game is this you're playing 
             with us?
      **Niles:** Well I'm not, I'm not... [_loudly_] Oh, what a good idea!  
             Why don't we all play a game?  Anyone have any suggestions?
      **Carol:** What about Murder?  We played it at Irene Warner's party.  
             It was a hoot.
      **Woman:** How do we play?
      **Niles:** Well here, [_gets out pens and paper_] someone tear off slips of 
             paper and on one of them write the word "Murderer."  And then 
             we'll pass them out, and then everyone hide.  We'll turn out 
             the lights, then the murderer kills someone and they lay down 
             on the floor, then we turn on the lights and the detective 
             solves the crime.
    **Frasier:**[_who entered during the instructions_] I tell you what,           
             I'll volunteer to play the detective for the first round. 
             Let the mayhem begin! 
    **Latimer:** Oh, Martin, there you are!  Come, hide with me, I know a 
             little nook where no one will find us. [_goes upstairs_]
     **Martin:** This game's a lot scarier than I thought! [_exits in other 
             direction_]
    **Frasier:** Alright?  Turn out the lights, everyone hide.
    _The lights are turned off, however we can still see.  Everyone hides, 
    except for Mr. Probst, who is looking at his paper.  Roz is standing 
    by.  Niles and Frasier exit to the kitchen._
    
     **Probst:** Ah, can't see. 
        **Roz:** Oh, can I help you, sir?
     **Probst:** I don't have my glasses, can you tell me what it says on this 
             thing?
        **Roz:** It says "Murderer."
     **Probst:** Good. [_holds a pretend gun to her head_] Then you're dead.
        **Roz:**[_lays down; sarcastically_] This party just gets better and 
             better.
    _Meanwhile in the kitchen Daphne is preparing the food with Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** How soon?
     **Daphne:** I'm going as fast as I can.  The first batch should be ready 
             in five minutes.
    **Frasier:** Alright, five minutes it is.  Ready or not, here I come!
    _Frasier enters the room.  Roz and Mr. Probst are laying on the floor. 
    Everyone comes from their hiding place._
    
    **Frasier:** My goodness, the foul fiend has struck already.  Turn the 
             lights on. [_they come up_] Good heavens, he's struck twice!
        **Roz:** Frasier...
    **Frasier:** Uh-uh, once dead you cannot move or speak, take your cue from 
             Mr. Probst.  Alright, everyone. [_in a detective-like voice_] 
             Did any of you see anything suspicious?  Any odd behavior?
     **Alfred:** Why don't you just guess, so we can get this thing over with.
    **Frasier:** Not yet, this is very intriguing.  I think I'm going to have 
             to think about it for... five minutes or so.
      **Carol:** Maybe this game was a bad idea.
    **Frasier:** No, the fun's just started.  I tell you what, let's turn off 
             the lights again and we'll let our craven villain ply his 
             dark trade once more.
     **Alfred:** Are you quite sure those two didn't die of starvation?
    **Frasier:** Very funny!  Would you just turn out the lights, please?
    
    _The lights are turned off._
    
    **Frasier:** Alright everyone, hide!
    
    _They all go back to their places._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, I have a question.
    **Frasier:** No, Roz, no talking.
        **Roz:** Just tell me, can the murderer commit suicide?
    **Frasier:** Well no, Roz, that wouldn't make much sense, would it?
        **Roz:** That's what I thought, but Mr. Probst is the one who murdered 
             me.
    **Frasier:** Well, was he?  Well then, Mr. Probst, I don't think someone's 
             playing by the rules, is he?  You see, this way no-one else 
             can get murdered, can they? [_silence_] Mr. Probst? 
    
    _Frasier begins to feel his pulse.  Roz is worried and gets up._
    
        **Roz:** What is it?  What are you doing?
    **Frasier:** Nothing, Roz, nothing.
        **Roz:** Are you taking his pulse?
    **Frasier:** I'm trying to, I just can't find one.
        **Roz:** Oh my God!  When he fell down, I thought it was part of the          
             game.  It didn't even look real.
    _Then Niles enters, again thinking that the party curse is now extinct._
      **Niles:** Okay, it's time to wind the game up.  The appetizers are 
             ready, and may I say they are delicious.  I think this 
             party is finally back on track!
    **Frasier:** Niles!  I'm afraid Mr. Probst has passed on.
    _Long pause._
      **Niles:** What? 
    **Frasier:** Yes, you see, I think that heart condition of his finally 
             caught up with him.
      **Niles:** Dead?  No, no, no, he's sleeping.  Old people love to nap. 
             [_begins prodding him_] Mr. Probst, time to wake up.  Mr. 
             Probst...
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, he's gone.
      **Niles:** Oh my God, how could this happen?
        **Roz:** Shouldn't we notify someone? 
      **Niles:** No, he was a widower, he had no children, he lived alone in 
             this building for twenty-five years.  This is so awful.  Mr. 
             Probst is right, I am a menace.
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, this is not your fault. 
      **Niles:** But it happened at my party, it's all they will remember.  
             I might as well pack my bags.
    **Frasier:** No, I tell you what.  There's no need for that.  I think we 
             can still get him out of here without anybody noticing.
      **Niles:** How?
    **Frasier:** You go find Dad.  Tell him to call one of his friends at the 
             police department.  One of his good friends, right?  I'll 
             handle the rest.
      **Niles:** All right.
    
    _Niles exits down the hallway._
     
        **Roz:** What's the rest?
    **Frasier:** I'm going to use the game to distract everybody.  I will take 
             everyone into the kitchen for questioning, thus drawing their 
             attention from the bodies.
        **Roz:** What do you mean, "bodies"?
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:** No.
    **Frasier:** Get down.
    
    _She objects and he tries to force her._
    
        **Roz:** No, please no.
    **Frasier:** All right, how about this?  I will pay the airfare for that 
             vacation of yours next month.
        **Roz:**[_thinks, then_] No way, it's just too creepy.  First class?
    **Frasier:** Business.
        **Roz:** Done.
    **Frasier:** All right, get down there.
    
    _Roz lays down, shuddering as she does so.  Niles arrives back._ 
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier, Frasier, I found Dad hiding from Mrs. 
             Latimer.  He's called his friend.
    **Frasier:** Great.  Niles, start getting everyone in the kitchen.
      **Niles:** Wait, wait, won't they wonder why there hasn't been another 
             murder?
    **Frasier:** Good point. 
        **Roz:**[_from under Mr. Probst_] Could we move this along?!
    **Frasier:** Quiet!
    _Then Martin enters._
     **Martin:** The wagon's on its way.  When it gets here let me deal with 
             it.
      **Niles:** All right, thank you, Dad.  I really appreciate this...
    **Frasier:** Dad!  Can you do one more favor?  You are now the killer.  
             Listen, come on, you've got to murder somebody - preferably 
             in the kitchen!
     **Martin:** Oh, come on!  You're not going to make someone lie down on 
             this dirty floor again, are you?
    _At this moment Mrs. Latimer enters from the kitchen and spots Martin._
    **Latimer:** Oh, there you are, Martin.  Have you been hiding from me?
     **Martin:**[_with an idea, evil_] Hiding?  No, you're just the person 
             I've been looking for.
    _They exit back into the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, turn on the lights, everyone. [_whisper_] Roz, you 
             okay?
        **Roz:**[_sarcastic_] Yeah, it's a carnival down here.
    **Frasier:** Everyone.  There has been another murder... in the kitchen. 
             I'm ready to solve the crime, if you'll all join me... in 
             the kitchen.
      **Carol:** Why can't you solve it right here?
    **Frasier:** Well I could, you see, but that wouldn't be proper.  You see... 
             [_thinks, then_] the hors d'oeuvres are in there.  Come along, 
             people.  We've got food.  Don't touch the crime scene please, 
             thank you very much.
    _Everyone enters the kitchen._
        **Roz:** Hurry, his fingers are getting stiff!
    _Frasier enters the kitchen where everyone is standing.  Mrs. Latimer 
    is laying "dead" on the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Before I determine the identity of the killer, there are a 
             few questions I'd like to ask each of you.
    _The doorbell sounds._
      **Carol:** I'll get it.
    **Frasier:** No.  No-one leaves until I've solved the crime.  Except you, 
             Dad. 
    _Frasier lets Martin out._
    **Frasier:** All right, then.  I think I shall begin by drawing a diagram 
             of where each of you was standing when the first murder 
             occurred.
    _DISSOLVE TO: 
    
    Scene Five - Niles's Apartment.
    Time has lapsed as Frasier is just about finishing the diagram of 
    everyone.  The guests are now really bored standing around in the 
    kitchen.  Mrs. Latimer is still laying "dead" on the table._
    **Frasier:** So we have established Miss Finn was talking with Mr. Larkin 
             in the upstairs hall at 8:14.  And he muttered something.
    _Frasier quickly takes a look out of the door into the living room.  
    We see that the body bag is just being sealed up._
      **Carol:** Why do you keep looking out there?
    **Frasier:** I'll ask the questions around here, Mrs. Larkin. 
     **Alfred:** They already told you.  Your father killed Mrs. Latimer.  
             Mrs. Hawkins saw him.
    **Frasier:** Mrs. Hawkins thought she saw him!
    **Latimer:**[_lifts her head_] No, Martin did kill me.  He's got a lot to 
             learn about playing gently.
    **Frasier:** Mrs. Latimer, we have already broken the "no-eating while dead" 
             rule but we'll stand fast on the "quiet" one. [_stuffs a crab 
             puff in her mouth_] Now...
      **Carol:** I'm bored and I'm going home.
    **Frasier:** No, wait.
    _Everyone exits.  Frasier expects the worse and defends his brother._
    **Frasier:** You can't blame Niles for this because...
    _Frasier exits and sees the dead body has gone.  Martin, Niles, Roz and 
    Daphne are standing with a "fake" smile on their faces._
    **Frasier:**[_covering_] My father is the killer!  Yes, the case is closed.  
             Shall we have another round?
    _People disagree._
    
     **Alfred:** Where's Probst?
        **Roz:** He just left.  He wasn't feeling well.
      **Niles:** Yes, I hope he's alright, poor man.
     **Alfred:** Well, who cares?  I never liked the old coot anyway.
      **Niles:** You didn't?
     **Alfred:** I was planning on voting for you tonight just to annoy him.
      **Carol:** Me, too!
      **Niles:** Well, why don't we vote right now?
     **Alfred:** Consider it done. [_shakes Niles's hand_] You're in, Crane. 
             Welcome back.  Carol, let's get out of here.
    _Everybody leaves and Niles wishes them goodbye.  Meanwhile, Roz and 
    Frasier are round the punch bowl._
        **Roz:** Doesn't he have anything stiffer than punch to drink?  
             I don't like looking at dead bodies, much less touching 
             them.
    **Frasier:** I think he's got a bottle of vodka in the freezer, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, great.
    _RESET TO: Kitchen
    
    Roz enters the kitchen.  She opens the fridge door and gets out the
    bottle of vodka.  But at first she doesn't notice Baby stuffed onto 
    a shelf in the door compartment, stiff and upside down...
    
    RESET TO: Living Room
    
    Outside, Niles says goodbye to the last guests._
      **Niles:** Thank you so much for this second chance.  I can assure you, 
             from now on this will be the quietest apartment in the Montana.
        **Roz:**[_o.s._] OH, MY _GOD!_
      **Niles:** Goodnight. 
    _Niles shuts the door and then looks around at Frasier and Daphne, who 
    have obviously had enough.
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    Niles's Apartment - Niles is reading on his fainting couch.  He looks 
    around the room, stands up and eyes the antique couch that Dr. 
    MacLowery tipped over in his dance routine.  Niles goes to the other 
    side of the room, takes a run-up and does the trick, admiring his 
    work afterwards.

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - EVENING_
    
    Niles is irritated and disgruntled as he and Frasier return from 
    dinner. As they recount their evening to Martin we learn that at the 
    restaurant they were first served an inferior Pouilly Fuisse, then 
    seated next to Donny and Daphne who were being very affectionate.  
    Frasier switched chairs with Niles so he wouldn't have to watch, only 
    be confronted a few minutes later with the spectacle of Maris coyly 
    flirting with her new boyfriend over dinner to taunt Niles.
    
    Niles is depressed about the whole evening and just wants to go home 
    to the Montana.  Martin asks whether he can't afford to go back now, 
    and Niles answers that he can except that Frasier persuaded him to 
    sublet the apartment to a starchy dignified tenant who still has two 
    months remaining on his lease.  
    
    His dejection is complete when Daphne comes in, beaming.   Apparently
    while Niles had hesitated to send back the inferior wine at dinner, 
    Donny had not only sent back the same wine but also made a scene and 
    got the restaurant to waive the bill for their entire meal.  Daphne 
    goes off to her room saying how proud she is of Donny, and Niles 
    moans that he just wants to go home.  Frasier agrees to call the 
    tenant at the Montana and try to break the lease.  
      
    ****TAPS AT THE MONTANA****
    _SCENE TWO - Hallway Outside Niles's Apartment_
    
    Niles and Frasier are about to ring the doorbell when they meet Mrs.
    Latimer, a neighbor who observes that Niles is back from his tour.  
    Niles replies that his sublet was able to move out early, and after 
    she leaves Frasier inquires about the tour.  Niles tells him that he 
    had informed his neighbors that he was going on an African lecture 
    tour -- wouldn't have done to let them know the real reason he was 
    moving out, and he hadn't wanted them to be able to contact him.  
    They ring the doorbell and when there is no response they let 
    themselves in with Niles's key.  
    
    Niles is thrilled to be home after four months.  "I just want to 
    close my eyes and savor the serenity!"  But the serenity is short-
    lived as the sound of loud tap dancing echoes from upstairs. A figure 
    dances into view on the parquet floor of the stair landing, then 
    slides down the bannister to the living room to continue his dance 
    routine.  It's Dr. McLowrey, a gray-haired man wearing a Walkman and 
    doing an enthusiastic tap routine all over Niles's parquet-covered 
    living room floor.  Frasier asks when McLowrey had taken up tap 
    dancing, and the doctor replies that he adopted it years ago to keep 
    from going crazy.  Too late, Niles observes.
      
    The last straw for Niles is when McLowrey leaps onto one of Niles's
    antique chairs and tips it over in a dance routine reminiscent of 
    both Fred Astaire and Niles's fencing scene in "An Affair To Forget" 
    when he tips over the couch.   Niles is panicked at the potential 
    damage to his apartment, and Frasier tries to remind the doctor about 
    the neighbors. McLowrey replies that the neighbors are sourpusses, 
    always complaining, and taps merrily off to the kitchen.
    
    Just then the doorbell rings and Niles greets three members of the
    building's tenants' board:  an older couple, the Larkins, and a
    sour-looking grayhaired man named Mr. Probst.  Probst informs Niles 
    that they abhor noise in the building and the board is leaning toward
    rescinding his lease.  Niles tries to protest but Probst tells him 
    that he has a heart problem and the other tenants need quiet.  He 
    cautions Niles that there will be a board meeting the following 
    evening, and if he were Niles, he wouldn't plan on unpacking.  Niles 
    is in shock as they leave.
    
    _SCENE THREE - Niles' Apartment - The Following Evening_
    
    There is a very subdued party in progress as Niles hosts the 10 or so
    members of the tenants' board, all of whom are wealthy-looking senior
    citizens.  Daphne and Frasier are helping Niles at the punchbowl as
    Daphne tells Frasier he was nice to help his brother by organizing 
    the party.  Niles replies that it was the least Frasier could do 
    after subletting the apartment to "Bojangles the Loon".
    
    The doorbell rings and Daphne admits Roz and Martin.  They go over to 
    the punch bowl and Roz tells Niles how surprised she was to get his
    last-minute invitation.  He tells her the caterer cancelled and 
    orders her to open the wine, cut up some limes and hang up the coats.  
    Roz is miffed but Frasier enlists her help and she agrees if Frasier 
    will pay for the babysitter.  Frasier agrees and Roz goes off to hang 
    up her coat.
    
    Martin cynically inquires what his role will be -- dishwasher?  
    Frasier tells him that there are several unattached women his age who 
    "might just take a shine to an old debonair dog like yourself."  
    ****Martin:**** "I'm just a piece of meat to you guys!"  Just then Daphne 
    returns to the punchbowl from her rounds of serving drinks.  She 
    starts to help Frasier but is distracted when her earring slips off 
    and slides down her blouse.  She retrieves it and remarks that she 
    was grateful it didn't end up in the punchbowl.
    
    Meanwhile Niles is making lame jokes with the party guests and 
    failing miserably.  He heads for the kitchen in desperation.
    
    As he enters Frasier is shooing Baby away from the kitchen table 
    where she is sampling the canapes.   Niles returns her to her perch 
    as she pelts him with slang taught to her by Niles's neighbors from 
    the Shangri La.  To her "Stuff it, Niles!" he replies, "Oh, don't 
    tempt me."  And back to the living room he goes with Frasier to 
    deliver the food.
    
    One of the female guests collars Niles to inquire who Martin might 
    be.  Niles tells her and she goes off in hot pursuit.  Roz complains 
    that one of the elderly men pinched her.  When Frasier doubts how 
    hard an arthritic old man can pinch, she demonstrates on his chest.  
    Niles goes into a panic because the guests are not mingling or having 
    a good time, and Frasier reassures him, fleeing into the kitchen for 
    more food.
    
    Frasier enters the kitchen to find Daphne with her back turned and 
    Baby lying dead on the kitchen table in the middle of a tray of 
    canapes.  Frasier gasps and asks how it happened.  A stunned Daphne 
    replies that Baby must have eaten some of the hors d'ouvres [_I can 
    never spell that and I'm not looking it up now._]  Niles comes in for 
    more appetizers and Frasier throws a towel over Baby to keep Niles 
    from seeing her.  
    
    
    _ACT TWO_
    
    ****POLLY WANT A STOMACH PUMP?****
    
    _SCENE ONE - Niles's Kitchen - A Moment Later_
    
    Niles wants to know what has happened, and Frasier flees to the 
    living room to collect the appetizers and leaves Daphne to deliver 
    the bad news.
     
    Frasier races around the living room collecting food trays and 
    grabbing appetizers out of the guests' hands.  He returns to the 
    kitchen.
    
    Niles is giving Baby CPR, but it's too late.  He's shocked and sad 
    but not really heartbroken as Frasier returns with the food and they 
    begin trying to guess which appetizer has gone bad.  Was it the pate?  
    The mayonnaise?  Meanwhile Frasier begins dumping canapes into the 
    garbage.
    
    A guest enters the kitchen and complains that she needs something to 
    blot the wine she's spilled on her dress.  She tries to take the 
    towel that covers Baby, but Daphne hands her a piece of bread instead 
    and she leaves, blotting her dress.
    
    As Daphne picks up Baby there is a small clattering sound, and Daphne
    discovers her loose earring which has fallen out of Baby's mouth. 
    Apparently that's what has killed her.  They are relieved to know the
    food hasn't gone bad and they try to stop Frasier from dumping all 
    the food into the garbage, but it's too late.  Now Daphne will have 
    to re-make all the food.
    
    Roz bursts into the kitchen and Daphne hastily stuffs Baby into the
    freezer and closes the door.  Roz complains about the guests and 
    Niles moans that his party is doomed, but Frasier won't let him give 
    up.  He shoves Niles back into the living room to stall the guests 
    while he and Daphne make more food.
    
    As Niles returns to the living room Mr. Probst comes up to Niles
    complaining about the lack of food.  "What kind of game are you 
    playing here?"  As he begins to deny playing games Niles gets 
    inspired and declares that they should all play a game.  One guest
    suggests a game of "Murder".  All the guests will get slips of paper, 
    one of which reads "Murderer".   While the other guests hide he will 
    pick one victim to kill.  Frasier comes in and volunteers to be the 
    detective who solves the crime.  
    
    Frasier turns out the lights and the guests dutifully hide.  Mr. 
    Probst can't read his slip of paper, and Roz helps him to read the 
    word "Murderer" on his piece of paper.  Probst grumpily informs Roz 
    that she's dead, and she lies down on the floor complaining about the 
    game.
    
    When Frasier turns the lights on he finds Roz lying next to Mr. 
    Probst, who is face down on the floor with his arm over Roz.  Roz 
    protests but Frasier informs her the murder victim can't talk, and so
    she subsides.  The guests come out of hiding and Frasier tries to 
    stall them as they complain about the boring game and the lack of 
    food.  He suggests turning off the lights again so the murderer can 
    strike again, and off go the lights as the guests return to their 
    hiding places.
    
    Roz flags down Frasier from her place on the floor, asking if the
    murderer can commit suicide. It turns out that Mr. Probst is not
    feigning unconsciousness but has actually died while playing the 
    game. Roz is appalled to think that she had been lying next to a dead 
    man. Niles comes in from the kitchen to receive the news and can't 
    believe it. He is in despair over his chances at staying at the 
    Montana now, but as usual Frasier has a plan.   Roz and Frasier 
    nearly panic, but Frasier suggests they simply bring the other guests 
    out to the kitchen and have Martin call his friends at the police 
    station to remove the body quickly. Meanwhile, Roz must lie down next 
    to Probst and continue to play the part of murder victim till the
    police come.  Roz at first refuses till Frasier bribes her with 
    airfare to her vacation destination the followng month. 
    
    Martin comes in after having made his phone call and agrees to play 
    the murderer.  He goes off to the kitchen with one of the guests who 
    has been annoying him.  Frasier turns on the lights and brings out 
    the other guests, dragging them off to the kitchen to expound on the 
    identity of the murderer.  He keeps it up in spite of the guests' 
    complaints until he sees that the police have taken away the body. 
    
    Finally the guests are bored and rebel, exiting back to the living 
    room where they remark on Mr. Probst's absence.  Niles tells them 
    Probst didn't feel well and went home.  One of the other guests 
    remarks that he had been planning to vote in favor of Niles just to 
    annoy Probst, and the others agree.  They take a quick vote, welcome 
    Niles back to the Montana, and  beat a hasty retreat out the front 
    door to escape the ghastly party.
    
    Roz complains about the lack of hard liquor, and Frasier tells her 
    Niles keeps a bottle of vodka in the freezer.  Niles is assuring his 
    departing guests that there will be no further noise from his 
    apartment when Roz's bloodcurdling scream from the kitchen announces 
    that she has located Baby's final resting place in the freezer door.
    
    _FADE OUT._

    _- Niles's Apartment_
    
    Niles is contentedly reading in his dressing gown in the living room.  
    He gets up to go to bed and gazes happily around his apartment.  As 
    he reaches the front door he seems to make up his mind.  He runs 
    across the living room and leaps up on the antique chair, expertly 
    tipping it over as McLowrey had done in his dance routine.  He 
    savors the moment, then dances off up the stairs to bed.
