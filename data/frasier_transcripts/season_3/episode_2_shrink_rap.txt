    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One(a) - Therapist's Office
    The scene fades in on Niles, who is lying on a therapist's couch, 
    pouring his heart out._
    
      **Niles:** You try and try, but at some point you finally have to admit, 
             as much as you care about each other, your relationship isn't 
             working and hasn't been for some time.
    _The camera pans across to show Dr. Schachter, a couples therapist,
    sitting in an easy chair and taking notes._
    
    **Schachter:** But you two wouldn't be sitting here with me if you didn't 
               want to save this relationship.  Isn't that true?
        **Niles:** Well, I'd be willing to try.  I can't speak for...
    _The camera pans across to reveal not Maris, but Frasier, sitting on an 
    identical therapist's couch._
    
    **Frasier:** You don't have to speak for me, Niles.  I'm perfectly capable 
             of speaking for myself.
      **Niles:** Yes, I know.  Caruso wasn't so in love with the sound of his 
             own voice.
    **Frasier:** What is _that_ supposed to mean?
      **Niles:** Well, you tell me, Enrico.  What do you think it means?
    **Frasier:** I guess I can tell you...
    
    _The two start arguing until Schachter intervenes._
    
    **Schachter:** Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! [_they quiet down_] Now, are we 
               agreed that we want to do something to fix this problem?
    
    _Frasier and Niles mutter sullenly._
    
    ****Frasier/Niles:**** Yeah.../Well, if it's fixable, I suppose... 
    **Schachter:** All right.  Why doesn't one of you tell me how this started?
    
    _Niles starts to open his mouth, but-_
    
    **Frasier:** Well, it began with me.  Last week, I was at work doing my 
             radio show.  I was on the air with a troubled young woman. 
             She had just started telling me about a recurring dream 
             she had since childhood.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two - KACL
    Frasier flashes back to his show._
    
       **Jill:**[_v.o_] Okay, I'm in my bedroom, I'd just gotten out of the bath 
             tub to get dressed. When I opened the closet, all my clothes 
             are gone. Suddenly, I hear the sound of footsteps on the drive 
             outside. I turn and there is a little girl with her nose 
             pressed up against the window.
    **Frasier:** That is amazing!
    
    _Meanwhile, Roz notices the time._
    
       **Jill:**[_v.o_] But her breath is clogging up the glass so that I 
             can't make out her face.  Only, I'm sure she's come to 
             tell me something important.
    _Roz tries to get Frasier's attention about the show coming to the close 
    but he fails to notice her._
    
    **Frasier:** So, a girl on the other side of a glass with an urgent message.
    _Roz now gets on the side and frantically bangs on the window telling 
    him the time is up but he still doesn't realize._
    
    **Frasier:** And for some reason you're unwilling or able to receive it.
        **Roz:**[_switches on her microphone_] I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, I hate to 
             interrupt, but you're all out of time for today.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.  Um, listen, Jill, I'm terribly sorry, but listen, 
             [_Bulldog enters looking annoyed at his delay_] I'd like to 
             continue talking to you when we're off the air, so please 
             don't hang up.  In the meantime, listeners, I've enjoyed our 
             time today.  Tune in again tomorrow when we'll be talking 
             with...
    **Bulldog:**[_into microphone_] Blah, blah, Frasier Crane Show, happy 
             health, goodbye!
    _Bulldog presses the off-air button and pushes Frasier to the wall 
    in his chair, yanking off his headphones as he does so.  Frasier 
    walks out of the booth as Bulldog begins his show._
    
    **Bulldog:** Yo, Jill.  You a football fan?
       **Jill:**[_v.o_] Not really.
    **Bulldog:** Beat it! [_presses button_] All right, this is Bulldog, ready 
             to go!
    
    _Frasier enters Roz's booth where Bulldog's producer is working. 
    Frasier chats to Roz who is sorting the carts._
    
    **Frasier:** I hate this job.  Not only do I have to put up with that 
             annoying little sweat-sock, but when a caller comes in who 
             has a truly fascinating problem, I'm barely even able to 
             scratch the surface.  It makes me want to run screaming
             back to private practice! 
        **Roz:** I can imagine how frustrated you must be.  This show's gotta 
             be constraining for a man of your staggering intellect. 
             [_gives him a smile of awe_]
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] Hold it, stop, wait a minute!
    _SMASH CUT TO: 
    
    Scene One(b) - Therapist's Office._
      **Niles:** You expect us to believe that Roz actually used a phrase 
             like "staggering intellect"?
    **Frasier:** It was something like that.
      **Niles:** So, she might have said your "boundless brilliance," or, say,  
             "the Olympian reaches of your wisdom."
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, do shut up.
      **Niles:** Oh, you shut up!
    
    _They carry on arguing for a while.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene One(c) - Therapist's Office.
    We go back to where we left off with Frasier and Niles arguing._
    
    **Schachter:** Gentlemen, gentlemen!  It is not important exactly what was 
               said.
        **Niles:** No, what is important is that he assumes it revolves around 
               him, when the truth is it started several days before that, 
               with me.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Niles's Office
    Flashback.  Niles is comforting an elderly patient, who is holding 
    herself with both arms in fear._
    
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] I'd been having some trouble with the psychiatrist in 
             the office next door.  His unconventional therapy had started 
             to intrude upon my sessions.
    
      **Niles:**[_going to patient_] Mrs. Kelly, the key here is that you trust 
             me.  So long as you're in this office you have no reason to 
             feel anything but safe.
    
    _A man's scream is heard from next door which scares Mrs. Kelly._
    
      **Niles:** Just, please, think of this as your refuge, your sanctuary.
    
    _A woman's scream bellows in, scaring Mrs. Kelly further._
    
      **Niles:** I'm not saying that being a sole survivor of a plane crash 
             wasn't a traumatizing experience for you.  But, I can get 
             you to a point where the memories no longer haunt you.
    _Now both the man and the woman scream together, reducing Mrs. Kelly
    to a nervous wreck.  Niles can do nothing but put his arm around her._
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] His primal scream madness was ruining my practice.  
             I had to do something.  The opportunity presented itself 
             that Friday.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles carries on with his narration over this scene: Niles is going to 
    the bar for sherry as Daphne folds some clothes.  Martin is sat in his 
    chair and Frasier is on the sofa._
    
      **Niles:**[_v.o_] I'd come to Frasier's for dinner.  I remember Daphne, 
             my father's health care worker, was telling the most 
             delightful story...
     **Daphne:** Oh, I know what you're going though, Dr. Crane, dealing with 
             a noisy neighbour.  Have I ever mentioned that couple that 
             lived next door to me in London?  A married couple, who made 
             the most un-Godly racket - in bed!  The walls must have been 
             like tissue paper because I'd hear the whole performance 
             every night.  Finally, I decided the only to get them to 
             stop was to let them hear what I'd been hearing.  So, one 
             night, I moved near the wall and I started... 
    
    _Niles freezes with the sherry bottle poised over his glass as Daphne 
    acts out her story with voice and actions.  Frasier and Martin, also 
    shocked, turn to look at her._
    
     **Daphne:**[_moaning_] Ooh, yes!  Ooh, oh don't stop -  [_gasping_] Ooh, 
             that's the spot - [_screams_] Oh, do it again!  Oh, you are 
             the beastmaster, aren't you?!  Oh, for heaven's sake, just 
             take me, you devil-spawned sex monkey! [_tosses her head, 
             flinging her hair wildly about_] YES, YES, YES, YES, YES! 
             [_stops, normal again_] Problem solved.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, Daphne, I drifted.  Would you mind telling that 
             story again?
    **Frasier:**[_v.o_] Hold it, stop!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene One(d) - Therapist's Office.
    Frasier stops the flashback._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, you know full well that Daphne merely told us that 
             story, she did not act it out.
      **Niles:**[_uncertain_] Didn't she?
    **Frasier:** No!  Just tell the story!
      **Niles:** Fine.  It was a few hours later...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Five(a) - Frasier's Apartment.
    The flashback takes us to a few hours later that night when Martin, 
    Frasier and Niles sit down with cups._
    
      **Niles:**[_v.o_] We were having espresso, and, perhaps to counter-act the 
             stimulative effect, Frasier was telling us about his day.
    **Frasier:** You know, I can't stop thinking about my last caller today. 
             Fascinating young woman who had a recurring dream.
     **Martin:** You know who's a helluva dreamer?  Eddie.
    
    _The boys give him a look._
    
     **Martin:** One night I'd wake up, he's lying on my forehead, dead asleep, 
             with a big clump of my hair in his mouth, growlin'!  Bet you'd 
             love to analyze that little brain of his.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Yes, that would be the jewel in the crown of my 
             career! [_then:_] Still, thinking about this woman has started 
             me longing for private practice.  I guess I just miss the 
             chance to dig deep with my patients.
      **Niles:** Have you considered seeing patients on the side?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, of course.  I've got a list of people who've expressed 
             interest.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I have a proposition.  I mentioned that doctor in 
             the office next door?  Well, his lease is up.  If you were 
             interested in his office, as his landlord, I could tell him 
             and his screaming meamies to hit the road!
    **Frasier:** You?
      **Niles:** Mmm-mmm.
    **Frasier:** And I?
    **Niles:** Mmm-mmm.
    **Frasier:** Working side by side?
      **Niles:** Mmm-mmm.
    **Frasier:** I don't mind telling you the prospect sounds... quite 
             exciting!
      **Niles:**[_excited_] We could consult on each other's patients.
    **Frasier:**[_excited_] We could give seminars together.
      **Niles:** Even therapy groups!
    **Frasier:** Oh, my God, "Crane & Crane", I can see our logo already; 
             a giant Crane hovering over a human head!
    
    _Martin begins laughing at their idea._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, why are you laughing?  Why is Dad laughing?
     **Martin:** You two, you'll never learn.
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, you think this is a bad idea?
     **Martin:** The restaurant you bought together, that was a bad idea!  
             The book you tried to write together,  that was a bad idea! 
             But this.... [_thinks_] No, that restaurant was still the 
             stupidest one.
    **Frasier:** Two little mis-adventures and you doom us to failure.
     **Martin:** Oh, baloney, you've been like this since you were kids.  
             You two can't work together.
      **Niles:** Maybe Dad's right.  We're not ready for this, it could lead 
             to conflict and tension.
    **Frasier:**[_v.o_] Hold it!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene One(e) - Therapist's Office.
    Frasier breaks the scene._
    
      **Frasier:** Niles, tell the truth!
        **Niles:** Oh, all right.
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene Five(b) - Frasier's Apartment.
    We cut back to just after Martin's speech._
    
        **Niles:** Stop raining on our parade, Dad!
      **Frasier:** To "Crane & Crane"!
    
    _The brother clink their espressos together.
    
    End of Act One
    
    Act Two_
    
    **HMMM...**
    _Scene Six(a) - Niles's Office.
    Frasier narrates the story in flashback.  Niles is getting some coffee 
    as Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:**[_v.o_] Well, our first day together began innocently enough...
    
    **Frasier:**[_enters_] Good morning, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** And to you, Dr. Crane
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, why should we be so formal, there's nobody around.
    
    _Frasier lifts his hand for a hi-five, Niles backs off in fear._
    
    **Frasier:** It's a hi-five, Niles!
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
    
    _They hi-five and Niles lets out a squeal of pain._
    
      **Niles:** Would you like a coffee?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, please. [_takes one as he inhales_] Oh, Niles, I can't 
             tell you how much I've missed that.  The smell of the office 
             place.  Freshly oiled leather couches, the pungent coffee, the 
             aroma of an exotic luncheon special wafting up from the 
             cafeteria below.
      **Niles:** Actually, that's the lab next door.  They lost power last 
             night, some of their tissue samples turned.  By the way,  
             I've put together some recent articles you may want to 
             peruse just to get up to speed. [_shows him a select few_]
    **Frasier:** Up to speed?
      **Niles:** Well, it has been a while since you've practised and we could 
             all use a little brushing up.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's very considerate of you.  Just put my homework 
             assignment in my box there.
      **Niles:** As you wish. 
    _Niles puts the select articles in, then picks up a small pile of books 
    from the desk and also puts them in the box.  Then he lifts a large 
    stack of books from the floor and also puts them in the box.  Frasier 
    is not amused.  Daphne enters, struggling with a large plant._
    
     **Daphne:** All right, where shall we put this then?
    **Frasier:** Well, the only place it should go, actually, is right here 
             by the couch, I think. 
      **Niles:** No, no, Daphne, here on the desk will pick up the earth tones 
             in the carpet.
    **Frasier:** No, there's this desk space here by the coffee station.
      **Niles:** Oh, underneath the heating vent?!  Why not just give it a 
             blindfold and a cigarette!
    **Frasier:** It's your office, put it where you like.
      **Niles:** No, no, it is your plant.
     **Daphne:** And it's my bleedin' back, so I'm putting it right here!
    
    _Daphne puts the plant down on the coffee table._
    
     **Daphne:**[_aside to Frasier_] Honestly, I don't know how you put up with 
             him. [_exits_]
      **Niles:**[_v.o_] Liar!  Liar!  Daphne never said that!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene One(f) - Therapist's Office.
    Niles brings the scene back._
    
      **Frasier:** Well, she said it with body language.
        **Niles:** I happen to be fluent in that language and she said nothing 
               of the kind!
    **Schachter:** Will someone tell me what's so important about this plant?
        **Niles:** You'll know soon enough.  I'm telling the rest of the story.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Six(b) - Niles's Practice.
    We flashback to Daphne still struggling with the plant._
    
     **Daphne:** I'm putting it right here!
    _Daphne puts the plant down on the coffee table and exits as Martin 
    enters with some plaques._
     **Martin:** You know the best thing about getting old?  Your hair may 
             turn grey, your joints may stiffen, you may even have to 
             walk with a cane.  But people still ask you to help them 
             move!
    **Frasier:** Forgive me for overburdening you, Dad.  Could you just put 
             those in my office, please?
    _Martin angrily exits to Frasier's office as Daphne enters and notices 
    the sign on the door.  It says "Niles Crane" and then in very small 
    letters underneath it says "Frasier Crane."_
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, look at your two names together on the door.  Er, Dr. 
             Crane, is your brother's name smaller than yours?
      **Niles:** Yes, that was the only way it would fit.  I assumed you 
             wouldn't mind - after all, we're concerned here with healing 
             people, aren't we?
    **Frasier:** Of course, Niles.  If I were interested in self-promotion, 
             I guess I'd be content with my radio show, heard every day  
             by over half a million listeners - the Pacific Northwest and 
             parts of Canada!
    
    _Niles picks up the plant._
    
    **Frasier:** What are you doing?
      **Niles:** I'm moving the Chepalire.
    **Frasier:** I like it where it was.
      **Niles:** Yes, but it didn't like it there.  It wants light.
     **Daphne:** You two tend to your plant, I'll go fetch the file cabinet! 
             [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** I have had this plant for two years and it has never been in 
             direct sunlight.
      **Niles:** Well, obviously, look at it, the leaves are puckering!
    **Frasier:** They are not, they've wilted a little from the ride over in 
             the trunk of the car.
      **Niles:** Oh, nonsense, Mafia snitches emerge from car trunks looking 
             more robust!
    **Frasier:**[_gets a hold on the plant_] This plant is going right over...
    
    _They start bickering again._
    
     **Martin:**[_entering_] And so it begins!
    
    _He laughs and exits._
    
      **Niles:**[_v.o_] Of course, the incident with the plant was only the 
             beginning.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene One(g) - Therapist's Office.
    Niles tells the story._
    
      **Niles:** That was followed by a run-in at the receptionist's desk, 
             a row at the coffee machine, and a contretemps when Frasier 
             lost the men room's key. 
    **Frasier:** That was an accident.
      **Niles:** Yes, it very nearly was.
    **Frasier:** I am so tired of your exaggeration, you always make things 
             fifteen thousand times worse than they are!  I'm going to 
             tell the story from now on!
    _DISSOLVE TO: 
    
    Scene Seven - Niles's Office.
    Frasier narrates over the scene.  Frasier and Niles are stood amongst 
    a therapy group._
    
    **Frasier:**[_v.o_] The point is, our nerves were, well, pretty much shot 
             by the time we conducted our first therapy group together...
      **Niles:** First off, I have a colleague to introduce.  He is not only 
             An esteemed psychiatrist, he happens to be my brother, Dr. 
             Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** Afternoon.
    Kedlish: Wow, you're Dr. Crane from the radio.
    **Frasier:** Guilty as charged.
      **Niles:** Yes, but we all have to remind Dr. Crane that this is real 
             psychiatry now, not the radio.  No hanging up on the hard 
             ones here!
    **Frasier:** But rest assured I am trained to deal with a full range of 
             issues.  Everything from envy to jealousy!  But, I'll just   
             be observing today, I don't know you well enough to render 
             any opinions yet, so just pretend I'm not here.
      **Niles:** And good luck with that. [_approaches patient_] Mrs. Kalish, 
             perhaps you could bring us up to date on how you're dealing 
             with your divorce.  This is week two, isn't it? 
     **Kalish:** Yes.  Well, I actually had my first date last night.
      **Niles:** That's wonderful.
    **Frasier:** Hmmm...
     **Kalish:** Did you say something?
    **Frasier:** I don't think so.
     **Kalish:** It sounded like "Hmmm..." like you disapproved.
    **Frasier:** Well, since you've asked.  I think in divorce we have 
             painful feelings, which are never the less healthy feelings.  
             We start to date too quickly and we want to be sure that 
             that's not panacea for the pain.
      **Niles:** Ooh, yes, you'll all find my brother's quite adept with 
             those peppy little bromides; "panacea for the pain"!  You 
             can almost hear the phrase: We'll be right back after these 
             words from "Pringles"!
       **Carr:** You don't want to wait too long before you date though, 
             either.  I waited five years but then I was so desperate 
             I stayed with the first woman who came along.  She ended 
             up being the same controlling ice princess as my first wife.
    **Frasier:** Hmmm...
      **Niles:**[_covering_] Well, Mr. Carr...
       **Carr:** Wait, Dr. Crane, it sounded like your brother said something 
             again.
    **Frasier:** Well, since you've asked.  It occurred to me that by waiting 
             for five and becoming, as you said, desperate, that perhaps 
             you were really giving yourself license to pursue the woman 
             who reminded you of your first wife.  You had to repeat the 
             pattern.
       **Carr:** So, you're saying that it wasn't an accident?
    **Frasier:** We have an expression in psychiatry: "there are no accidents."
      **Niles:** Now let's check in with news and traffic.
    **Frasier:** Dr. Crane, are you denying that most accidents happen for a 
             reason?
      **Niles:** No, Dr. Crane, I believe they do.  I'm reminded of a recent 
             "accident" involving a four-inch wooden block attached to a 
             men's room key which walked off in somebody's pocket!  Clearly 
             an act of hostility, wouldn't ya' say?!
    **Frasier:** Certainly a well-deserved one, considering what an insufferable 
             _prig_ someone has been today!
      **Niles:** You _dare_ call me a prig after I rescued you from that 
             sideshow you call a radio program?
    **Frasier:** One more crack about my show and I'll put that little wooden 
             block in a place you'll always be able to find it!
      **Niles:**[_fumes, then:_] Group, take five minutes of quiet introspection!
    
    _Niles and Frasier leave the office and enter the reception area._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I have made a fist and I'm thinking of using it. 
             [_holds it up_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, you are not scaring me... the thumb goes on the outside, 
             Niles!  On the outside!
      **Niles:** How dare you try to steal my group!
    **Frasier:** I don't need your group!  I've got a group of my own, half a 
             million strong!
      **Niles:** Oh yes, your legions!  Why don't you rent a farm, pass out 
             the body paint and call it "Frasier-stock"!
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm just a little tired of your condescending 
             attitude.  You have not missed one single opportunity to 
             run down my show or grab a book off the shelf to help me 
             "get up to speed!"  My God, you're such a brilliant healer, 
             you've even taken over the care of my Schefflera!
      **Niles:** Well, you were starving it of sunlight!
    **Frasier:** All right, fine, let's just give this little dear all the 
             sunlight it needs!
    _Frasier picks it up and throws it out the window, breaking the glass 
    as it goes._
    
      **Niles:** Are you insane?!
    **Frasier:** If I were, "Doctor," you'd never know it!
      **Niles:** Oh...!
    
    _Niles and Frasier carry on arguing whilst Niles's group, frightened, 
    leave behind him._
    
      **Niles:** Is that my group?  Group, group, come back, group! [_they 
             exit and then:_] I'm very proud of this show of independence! 
             [_shakes a fist, then:_] I hope you're happy!
    **Frasier:** If I were, "Doctor," you'd never know it!
      **Niles:** Stop saying that!
    _They carry on arguing until the therapist, Dr. Schachter arrives._
    
    **Schachter:** Dr. Crane!
        **Niles:** Hello, Dr. Schachter. 
    **Schachter:** What's going on?
        **Niles:** I'm having a discussion with my brother.
    **Schachter:** I could hear your discussion across the hall in my office.
        **Niles:** Well, you see, he waltzed in here like the belle of the 
               ball and yet...
    
    _Frasier and Niles start arguing again._
    
    **Schachter:** Now, look, you two are obviously in some distress.  As you 
               know, I am a specialist in couples therapy.  Now I've never 
               treated brothers before, but still, if you step into my 
               office, I'm sure I can help you.
    **Schachter:**[_v.o_] Hold it!  Hold it! 
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene One(h) - Therapist's Office.
    Dr. Schachter now breaks the story and finishes the flashback._
    
    **Schachter:** I never said, "I'm sure I can help you."  I said, "I may be 
               able to help you."
        **Niles:** See how he twists your words?
      **Frasier:**[_dangles men's room key_] Right here, buddy boy.
    **Schachter:** Enough!  You are doctors!  I've never seen anything like 
               this in my life. [_to Niles_] You think he's trying to steal 
               your patients, [_to Frasier_] and you think he's trying to 
               undermine you as a psychiatrist.  But you must know what is 
               at the root of this problem.
    **Frasier/Niles:**[_pointing_] He is!
    **Schachter:** No.  You have a fundamental lack of trust.  Now it may be 
               so deeply rooted by now that it's impossible to change but 
               there are certain exercises that we try provided that you 
               two are willing.
    
    _They half-heartedly agree.  Schachter gets up and places a footstool
    in the center of the room._
    
    **Schachter:** Let's start with the most basic trust exercise there is. 
               Now, why don't you simply stand on this foot stool and 
               fall backwards into your brother's waiting arms, thus 
               demonstrating that we can trust each other. [_to Niles_] 
               Dr. Crane, why don't you go first?
        **Niles:** Well, all right.
    **Schachter:** Just get up there, and let yourself go.
    _Niles stands on the footstool as Frasier stands behind him waiting._
    
        **Niles:**[_starts to fall and then_] Is he standing directly behind me?
    **Schachter:** Yes, now trust your brother.
        **Niles:**[_takes some time_] I'd feel better if he were wearing 
               rubber soles.
      **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, Niles, just get down, I'll go first. 
               All right?
    
    _Frasier and Niles change places._
    
      **Frasier:**[_starts and then_] Is he in position?
    **Schachter:** Yes!  Trust him! 
      **Frasier:**[_takes some time_] You should know he catches like a girl!
    **Schachter:** I don't believe this.  Get down, will you? [_Frasier does_] 
               This couldn't be easier! [_gets up_] I get up here, I count 
               to three, and you catch me.  One, two, three.
    _However, Frasier and Niles have been too busy glaring distrustfully at 
    each other to pay attention to him.  He falls backwards and sprawls 
    onto the floor._
    
      **Frasier:** Why didn't you catch him?!
        **Niles:** Well, you were closer!
      **Frasier:** It was your turn!
        **Niles:** "It was my turn"...!
    **Schachter:**[_getting up_] That is it!  That is it!  In thirty years as a 
               couples therapist, I've never said what I'm about to say: 
               Give up!  It's hopeless!  You are pathologically mistrustful 
               of each another, competitive to the point of madness! [_gets 
               his coat_] So, trust me, just meet each other at weddings and 
               funerals, and the rest of the time, stay the hell away from 
               each other!  Now, I am going to limp to the nearest pub and 
               drink until the rest of me is as numb as my ass!
    
    _Schachter leaves, slamming the door behind him.  The brothers are 
    dumbfounded for a moment._
    
      **Niles:** Well... that's quite a diagnosis.
    **Frasier:**[_reads pad_] Yes.  But there is no denying it.  We are 
             vindictive and competitive....
      **Niles:** Petty, mistrustful...
    **Frasier:** As so often in these cases it took someone outside our 
             situation to point it out to us.
      **Niles:** Well, Dad always said it, but he has no credentials.
    **Frasier:** Well, there's no arguing with Dr. Schachter's credentials.
             [_motions to the diploma on the wall_] My God, the man is an 
             expert in his field.  He graduated from the University of... 
    
    _He reads the certificate, then turns with a smug smile._
    
    **Frasier:** Grenada!
      **Niles:**[_shocked_] Well, surely that was just his undergraduate 
             schooling.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, of course, his graduate work was done in... [_reads_] 
             Aruba!
      **Niles:** An all-Caribbean schooling... well, tally me banana!
    
    _They begin doing calypso dances._
    
    **Frasier:** I knew he was a fraud the minute he opened his mouth.
      **Niles:**[_laughs_] Oh, I'll have him out of his lease at the end of 
             the week.
    **Frasier:** Niles, we still have time to catch a late lunch!
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh, "Peris" is just around the corner.
    **Frasier:** Away we go.  Oh, "Chez Shea" is just as close.
      **Niles:** Yes but the food at "Peris" is much better.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles. [_laughs_] Have you lost your mind?
    
    _Frasier and Niles leave the office, still arguing about their choice 
    of restaurant._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    In Niles's practice we see Martin exit Frasier's office with the 
    plaques, looking very smug.  He leaves the reception area.  Then 
    Frasier exits with his box of bits and bobs.  This all seems very 
    light.  The receptionist then watches as Daphne struggles out with 
    a huge filing cabinet on a hand truck, of which she's been lumbered.
