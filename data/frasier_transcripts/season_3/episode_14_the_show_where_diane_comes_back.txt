## And In The Red Corner....

    
    
    
    Writer's Note: This episode is a favorite with Kelsey Grammer and the 
    Frasier writing staff, because it put to rest some real demons as 
    well as the fictional ones.  When Kelsey Grammer first started to 
    appear on _Cheers_ , Shelley Long campaigned strongly to get him and his 
    character removed from the show.  The producers disagreed, and 
    Frasier Crane soon became a regular, but there was bad blood between 
    Grammer and Long for a very long time.  This episode 
    not only allowed Frasier and Diane to have closure with each other, 
    but also allowed Grammer and Long to demonstrate that there were no 
    more hard feelings.

## Quotes & Scene Summary {michael lee}

    
    
    
    _Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is wrapping up his show.  Roz is talking on the phone and 
    looks worried._
    
    **Frasier:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780.
    
    _He goes off the air._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, that was security.  Some woman insisted on seeing 
             you, she just blew right past them.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't panic, Roz -- probably just one of my more ardent 
             fans.
    
    _Diane Chambers appears in the window and knocks on the glass.  
    Frasier turns around.  She smiles and waves at him.
    
    Focus on Frasier's wide-open mouth: "AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!"
    
    Cut to: Niles's Office
    Frasier bursts into Niles's office.  Niles is sitting at his desk 
    with a pad.  His patient, a man, is seated in an armchair by the 
    door._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, we've got to talk!  It's urgent.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'm with a patient!
    **Frasier:**[_notices man_] Oh, I'm sorry.
        **Man:** Is, uh, this about a woman?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Man:** Take all the time you need.
    
    _The man leaves._
    
      **Niles:** Well?
    **Frasier:** She's back -- the scourge of my existence.
      **Niles:** Strange, I usually get some sign when Lilith is in town -- dogs 
             forming into packs, blood weeping down the wall.
    **Frasier:** I'm talking about . . . Diane Chambers.
    
    _Niles hits the intercom._
    
      **Niles:** Lucille, send Mr. Carr home.
    **Frasier:** She just showed up at the station today.  Apparently some 
             play she wrote is being produced here in town.  I admit, I 
             just sort of panicked when I saw her, but I think I covered 
             it masterfully.
    
    _Frasier stops pacing and sits in a chair.  Niles picks up his pad._
    
      **Niles:** All right, all right, all right.  Well, uh, why do you think 
             you reacted that way?
    **Frasier:** Oh, spare me the psychiatrist bit, Niles.  That includes 
             putting down the pad! [_Niles lays the pad on the desk_] In 
             the drawer, Niles!
      **Niles:**[_puts it in the drawer_] Fine.  My first question to you is 
             this: Are you still in love with her?
    **Frasier:**[_jumps up from his chair_] No!  Not in the least!  It's a 
             ridiculous suggestion. 
      **Niles:** Seeing as how I have nowhere to write the phrase, "classic 
             denial," I'll move on.  So, about this woman for whom you 
             have so little feeling that you raced across town and burst 
             into one of my sessions--is there any lingering resentment?
    **Frasier:**[_dropping back into the chair_] Over what?!
      **Niles:** Well, she did leave at the altar.  When you told her how 
             that made you feel, was there anything you left unsaid? 
             [_Frasier looks away_] Any phrase or feeling you wished you 
             had expressed to her? [_Frasier looks away more_] I'm making 
             the assumption here that you did tell her how you felt.
    **Frasier:** I sort of did.
      **Niles:** "Sort of" is another one of those phrases that just wants to 
             go in my pad.
    **Frasier:** I expressed my distaste for the way I'd been treated, yes.
      **Niles:** Frasier, she rejected you in the most debilitating way a man 
             can be rejected.  You've got to more than "sort of" tell her 
             how that felt.
    **Frasier:** Well, I can't just tell Diane how awful she made me feel 
             now!  It's a distant memory for her.  I'd feel weak!
      **Niles:** You have no reason to feel weak.  You've moved on in your 
             life too.  You have a new career, new wealth, new success.  
             You simply need closure in this one area.
    **Frasier:** You know, what you just said made a lot of sense.
      **Niles:** You're going to get closure.
    **Frasier:** No, that business about my success!  I tuned you out after 
             that.  I'm going to invite Diane over for dinner tonight, 
             and I'm really gonna flaunt my success, really rub her nose 
             in it!  That'll prove I'm not just some cast-aside that 
             never got over her.  Niles, I know it's not psychologically 
             sound.  But we're still human.  We have to do what feels 
             good sometimes, don't we?
      **Niles:** I'd just like to be on the record as saying I'm against it.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
      **Niles:** You know the path that leads to peace with Diane and you're 
             rejecting it.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** I'm washing my hands of the entire matter.
    **Frasier:** Wouldn't miss it for the world though, would you?
      **Niles:** I'll be there at seven with a cheeky Bordeaux.
    
    _Frasier leaves.  Niles grabs his pad out of the drawer and starts 
    writing on it.
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's evening.  Daphne is arranging things for dinner.  Martin is 
    reading the paper.  Frasier comes out, wearing his best suit._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no, no.  Daphne, I was very specific about this.  The 
             mayor's plaque goes on the piano . . .
    
    _He moves the plaque to the piano._
    
    **Frasier:** The Otis Klandenning "Man of the Year Award" goes right over 
             here . . .
    
    _He places an elaborate silver bowl on the little table next to the 
    Armchair._
    
    **Frasier:** And my jewel--my SeaBee--goes right here where she can't miss 
             it! [_puts in on the mantel_]
     **Daphne:** Hmm, that seems a bit subtle.  Why don't I just use this to 
             serve the olives?
    
    _She takes the SeaBee trophy --a silver miniature of the Space 
    Needle--and spears an olive out of the appetizer tray._
    
    **Frasier:** Give me that!
     **Daphne:** I wish someone would just tell me who this woman is, and why 
             we're trying to impress the pants off her.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** She's a one-time Boston barmaid who had a nervous breakdown 
             and ended up in a sanitarium, where I met her, fell for her, 
             and then was so mercilessly rejected by her that to this day 
             there is a sucking chest wound where once there dwelled a 
             heart! 
    
    _He opens the door.  Diane stands there, elegant and smiling._
    
    **Frasier:**[_welcoming_] Diane!
      **Diane:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Please. [_she comes in_] You remember my brother Niles, my 
             father Martin, and this is his health-care worker, Daphne 
             Moon.
    
    _They all ad-lib hellos._
    
      **Diane:** What a tasteful abode.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's modest in its way.
      **Diane:** No, that's what I like about it.  After the rambling beach 
             house I've been living in, I'm ready for something smart and 
             efficient.
    **Frasier:** White wine, Diane?  I'm pouring an '85 Montrachet La Guiche 
             I purchased at auction.
      **Diane:** Oh, I always keep a bottle of that open myself.
    
    _Frasier's smile is so fixed on his face, it's painful to look at.  He 
    tosses her coat to Daphne._
    
    **Frasier:** Hang this up!
    
    _Diane sits opposite Martin._
    
     **Diane:** Well, Martin, it's been too long.  How have you been?
    **Martin:** Well, my wife died, I got shot in the hip, and I had to move 
            in with Frasier 'cause I kept falling down in the shower.
     **Diane:** Well, you look wonderful! [_pats his leg_] Yes, you do!
    **Martin:** That's the bad one.
     **Diane:** Oh! [_gets up_] Niles, do you remember the last time I was in 
            town and we dined together?  You had just started dating this 
            woman--she was the queerest little creature. [_Frasier hands 
            her a glass of wine_] Thank you. [_laughs_] She ate everyone's 
            sorbet, and then she had to lie down in the ladies' lounge 
            while the coat-check girl massaged her abdomen!
    
    _She stops laughing when she notices Frasier's uncomfortable look._
    
      **Diane:** Oh, I hope I haven't put my foot in it.  You and she didn't 
             get married and live happily ever after, did you?
      **Niles:** No, can't say as we did.
     **Daphne:** Care for an olive?
      **Diane:** Oh, thank you.
    **Frasier:** These are a Pyreenean taste treat!  They're handpicked and 
             bottled by Andalusian monks!
     **Daphne:**[_lifting the "Man of the Year" cup_] You can spit the pits in 
             here.
    
    _Frasier snatches the cup down as Diane spits, narrowly missing 
    Martin.
    
    Scene Three -- Frasier's Apartment
    Everyone is sitting at the dinner table.  Diane is telling a story._
    
      **Diane:** So, there I was, on the balcony of my Malibu beachhouse, 
             when a pod of whales passed by.  I knew I had to commune 
             with these gentle giants, so like a flash, I was on the 
             beach, scrambling to my kayak.  But cruel fortune 
             interceded, when, not twenty yards offshore, I suddenly 
             discovered myself entangled in an enormous bed of-of, um--
      **Niles:** Sea kelp?
      **Diane:** Exactly right, sea kelp!
     **Martin:** Oh, that's funny--I thought he said "seek help."
     **Daphne:** So, you haven't told us how you've come to be in Seattle.
      **Diane:** Oh, a small theater group has decided to produce a play I've 
             written.
    **Frasier:** Which one?
      **Diane:** Oh, my most recent work.  It's a sort of feminist odyssey, 
             experimental in places, in tone akin to Saroyan, with a 
             soupcon of Gide, and a hearty nod to Clifford Odesse!
    **Frasier:** I meant which theater?
      **Diane:** Oh!  The Roundabout.
     **Martin:** That seems appropriate.
    **Frasier:** You know, why don't you people just keep talking amongst 
             yourselves?  I will go and fetch the profitteros.  They were 
             prepared by the hottest new pasty chef in--oh, what's the 
             use?
    
    _Frasier goes to the kitchen.  Niles gets up._
    
     **Niles:** I'll help.  He always overpowders.
    **Martin:** Yeah, I'm sure Old Man Kennedy felt this kind of pride when 
            his boys would go out and play touch football.
    
    _In the kitchen, Frasier takes a plate of little cakes out of the 
    refrigerator._
    
      **Niles:** Now, Frasier, you know her better than I.  Is that what she 
             looks like when she's writhing in envy?
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up.  All right, I admit you were right.  Before she 
             leaves here tonight, I am going to tell her how much pain 
             she made me feel. [_energetically sprinkling sugar on the 
             cakes_] The savage truth this time--there will be no 
             sugarcoating it!  And yes, I am aware of the irony! [_blows a 
             puff in Niles's face_]
    
    _They bring the cakes out._
    
    **Daphne:** Oh, it must be wonderful to see your words come to life like 
            that.
     **Diane:** Oh yes.  It's a dream come true.
    
    _The right side of her face twitches suddenly._
    
     **Martin:** Diane, are you o.k.?
      **Diane:** Yes, I'm fine.  Why?
     **Martin:** Well, your cheek was kind of twitching.
      **Diane:** It was?  Oh well, it was probably fatigue.  Where were we?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I was asking about your play.
      **Diane:** Oh, right! [_she twitches again, harder_]
     **Martin:** There it goes again, the twitch!
     **Daphne:** That was either a very large twitch or a very small seizure.
      **Diane:** You know, I'm not sure how much I really want to talk about 
             my play right now. [_twitches even harder, and covers her 
             face with a napkin_] Bad luck and all that!
    **Frasier:** Yes, and we all know what a struggle it is to get Diane to 
             talk about herself.
      **Diane:**[_laughing_] Oh Frasier, you always could kid! How I miss 
             that! 
    
    _Her laughs slide gradually into tears, and then into noisy, full-
    blown sobbing._
    
    **Frasier:** Look, Diane, please, I-I really didn't mean anything by it.  
             I'm sorry--
      **Diane:** It's not that!  It's my whole life, it's ruined!
    **Frasier:** Niles, could you please get her some water?
      **Niles:** Of course, of course. [_goes to the kitchen_]
      **Diane:** Oh, everything I told you tonight is a lie.  I'm sorry for 
             this.  Oh, I must look just awful.
     **Martin:** Your cheek stopped jumping.
    **Frasier:** All right, now.  Tell me what happened.  Was it about your 
             play?
    
    _That sets off the twitch._
    
     **Daphne:** There it goes again!
    **Frasier:** Look, would you people please just give us some privacy?!
    
    _Everyone gets up and goes to the kitchen.  Frasier sits next to 
    Diane._
    
    **Frasier:** All right now.  From the beginning.
      **Diane:** Well, it all started a few months ago when I lost my job.  
             I'd been writing for "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."  I was on 
             the set one day, and I was trying to show Jane Seymour the 
             proper way to cauterize a wound with a branding iron, and I 
             accidentally set her hair on fire.  Well, from there it was 
             a steady slide downhill.  A two-year relationship ended, I 
             lost the beachhouse, friends stopped calling--the one bright 
             spot was my play in Seattle.  Well, I flew up here yesterday 
             only to find that the backer was pulling out.  I was so 
             distraught I found myself wandering around the city in 
             complete despair.  It's then that like a ray of hope from 
             heaven, I saw your smiling face on the side of a bus.  And 
             that's why I'm here today.  You helped me the only other 
             time I was this low.  Frasier, I'm asking for your help 
             again.
    **Frasier:** Of course I'll help you, Diane.
      **Diane:** Oh, Frasier . . .
    
    _In the kitchen:_
    
    **Daphne:** Well, that was a bit scary.
    **Martin:** I'll say--watching someone go completely crackers like that.
    
    _Niles starts to sniffle._
    
    **Martin:** What's the matter with you now?
     **Niles:** Nothing, I'm fine.  Just suddenly missing my Maris.
    
    _Daphne puts an arm around his shoulder and comforts him.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    **INTERPLAY**
    
    _Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Niles is seated at a corner table.  Frasier comes in.  Throughout the 
    followng scene, Niles never says a word._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, Niles, it's such a glorious day!  I walked all the 
             way here.  Thirty-two blocks, and Bruno Mallies be damned! 
             [_sits down_] Oh yes, I see the look, I know exactly what it 
             means too.  How could I very well say "no" to Diane?  She 
             came to me in crisis. [_to a passing waitress_] Oh, excuse me, 
             a double cappuccino, please, light cinnamon, thank you very 
             much. [_sighs_] Oh, you know, the change in Diane has really 
             been quite gratifying.  Dropped her off at the theater 
             today, and there was a smile on her face that I haven't seen 
             in . . . well, far too many years.  Oh, I know what you're 
             thinking.  Where did she get the money to do the play?  
             Well, she found a backer! [_pause_] It's tax deductible! [_the 
             waitress brings his coffee_] Thank you.  Oh, why don't you go 
             ahead and say what you're thinking, Niles?  That I'm falling 
             for her again.  "Well, you did bounce in here as though you 
             were on top of the world, and babbling about her smile"--I 
             just don't want to hear it, Niles!  I'm simply helping her 
             to get back on her feet and out of my life as quickly as 
             possible.  No, I don't know how long it's going to take.  
             Look, I said I don't know! Oh, really, Niles!  Curse you, 
             you are the most infuriating busybody!  I'm not sitting with 
             you.
    
    _Frasier gets up and goes to another table.  Niles takes a little pad 
    out of his jacket and starts writing._
    
    **FOREPLAY** _Scene Five -- Frasier's Apartment
    That evening, Diane and Frasier are standing next to each other, 
    looking out at the city._
    
      **Diane:** It really is a lovely city.
    **Frasier:** "Night--making all things dimly beautiful . . ."
      **Diane:** "One veil over us both."  Cyrano?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Eleven years later, we're still on the same page.
      **Diane:** Frasier, these past few weeks, you've given so much of 
             yourself to me.  I want to give the one gift I have to 
             bestow.  I want you to be the first person to see my play.  
             Will you come to dress rehearsal tonight?
    **Frasier:** Diane, I'd be honored?
      **Diane:** Oh, wonderful, wonderful! 
    
    _She ducks into the powder room.  Martin walks into the living room._
    
      **Diane:** Give me a second.
    **Frasier:** Are you sure you're ready for this?
      **Diane:** Oh yes, it's time.  Tonight, I bare myself to you.
    
    _Martin ducks behind the pillar._
    
    **Frasier:** Big step, Diane.
      **Diane:** Oh well, I have to say I'm a little nervous about it.  But, 
             barring any lighting or prop problems, the whole thing will 
             be over in a couple of hours.
     **Martin:**[_heading to the kitchen_] Hello!  People still in the house 
             here!
      **Diane:** Meet me at the theater at seven . . . I don't know what I've 
             done to deserve you.
    
    _They kiss.  Diane leaves, and Martin comes back._
    
    **Frasier:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** Listen, it's none of my business, but you're not falling for 
             her again, are you?
    **Frasier:** What if I were?
     **Martin:** That woman dumped you at the altar.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that was the old Diane.  She no longer sees herself as 
             the center of the universe.  And I'm not the old Frasier 
             anymore either.  People can change, Dad.
     **Martin:** Yeah, I suppose you're right.  Take me for instance.  The 
             old Martin would have said, "you're out of your mind.  I'd 
             rather see you go gay and shack up with the punk who shot me 
             than go off with her.  I'd rather see you sewed up inside 
             the body of a dead horse."  But the new Martin just says, 
             "Vivia l'amour."
    **Frasier:** The new Frasier resists the temptation to correct your 
             French.
    
    _Scene Six -- Theater
    Frasier sits alone in the rows of a small theater.  Diane comes out 
    from behind the curtain and speaks to the whole room._
    
    **Diane:** Well, the stage is set, my players are prepared.  So, without 
           further ado, I give you "Rhapsody and Requiem," a play by 
           Diane Chambers.
    
    _Frasier applauds.  Diane goes backstage.
    
    The curtain opens.  On the stage is a nearly-perfect replica of 
    Cheers back in Boston, complete with look-alikes.  Frasier's eyes 
    widen._
    
     **Stan:**[_Sam look-alike_] Boy, it sure is great having Mary-Ann back.  
           Just wasn't the same when she was gone.
    **Clark:**[_Cliff look-alike_] Yeah, well, you know, uh, recent studies at 
           John Hopkins University revealed that the expression "absence 
           makes the heart grow fonder," is in actuality rooted in 
           scientific bedrock.
    **Darla:**[_Carla look-alike_] Yeah, so's your head.
     **Stan:** Ease up there, Darla.
    
    _Ned [_Norm look-alike_] enters._
    
     **Ned:** Evenin', everybody.
    **Stan:** Hey there, Ned.  What would you say to a beer?
     **Ned:** What's a nice beer like you doing in a face like this?
    
    _Backstage, Diane laughs outrageously at her own joke.  For Frasier, 
    this is getting increasingly weird.  Then his own look alike, Dr. 
    Franklyn Creane, walks in the door._
    
    **Dr. Creane:** Salutations, all.
          **Stan:** Hey there, Doc.  What can I get you?
    **Dr. Creane:** Ooh, a prickly choice, Stan.  It reminds me of the one 
                the 18th-century wit John Wilkes faced when asked by the 
                Earl of Sandwich whether he expected to die on the 
                gallows or of the pox.  "That depends, sir," he said, "on 
                whether I choose to embrace your principles or your 
                mistress."
    
    _Mary-Ann [_Diane look-alike_] enters and takes center stage._
    
    **Mary-Ann:** Evening, people.
         **All:** Mary-Ann!
    
    _Cut to Later: the players are each illuminated by spotlights in turn 
    to give interior lines._
    
          **Stan:** I pour beer down people's throats.
           **Ned:** I drink it.
    **Dr. Creane:** Our lives are empty.  So what draws our feet here night 
                after night?
    
    _The lights come up, showing the three men at the bar, alone._
    
          **Stan:**
           **Ned:**      Mary-Ann.
    **Dr. Creane:**
    
    _Cut to Later: the bar is full.  Mary-Ann comes out and embraces Stan._
    
    **Mary-Ann:** Well, I'm off.  See you anon, mi amore.
        **Stan:**[_kisses her_] You bet, honey.
    
    _Frasier isn't sure how much more of this he can take._
    
    **Diane:**[_coming onstage_] Hold it, stop!  What kind of a kiss was that?  
           You two are supposed to be in love!
     **Stan:** Well, I didn't know how big you wanted it.
    **Diane:** Remember that kiss you gave me this morning?
     **Stan:** Like this one?
    
    _The actor grabs Diane and kisses her deeply.  Frasier stews with 
    jealousy._
    
    **Diane:** That's the one.  O.K., from the kiss! [_goes offstage_]
     **Stan:** You bet, honey.
    
    _They resume the scene.  Mary-Ann and Stan break apart._
    
      **Mary-Ann:** Forgive me, Franklyn.  I suppose that was a tad 
                inconsiderate.
    **Dr. Creane:** Quite all right.  A loving spirit like yours can't be 
                bridled.
      **Mary-Ann:** But I did leave you at the altar.
    **Dr. Creane:** No, you know I hold no ill-will toward you for that.
    
    _Frasier's about to explode._
    
    **Dr. Creane:** Could we just stop for a second?  This whole getting-
                left-at-the-altar thing--I just don't know what I'm 
                supposed to be feeling.
       **Frasier:** I may be able to illuminate that for you! [_gets up and 
                storms onstage_] What you are feeling is that this woman 
                has reached into your chest, plucked out your heart, and 
                thrown it to her hell-hounds for a chew toy!  And it's 
                not the last time either!  Because that's what this woman 
                is!  She is the devil!  There's no use running away from 
                her, because no matter how far you go, no matter how many 
                years you let pass, you will never be completely out of 
                reach of those bony fingers!  So, drink hearty, Franklin, 
                and laugh!  Because you have made a pact with Beelzebub!  
                And her name is Mary Ann!
    
    _Frasier storms out of the theater.  The rest of the cast members 
    break into applause.  Diane stands there, mortified._
    
    **AFTERPLAY**
    
    _Scene Seven -- Theater
    Diane is sitting at the bar, alone.  She is making notes on her play 
    script.  Frasier comes back._
    
    **Frasier:** Diane?
      **Diane:** Frasier . . .
    **Frasier:** I thought we should talk.
      **Diane:** Well, yes, I think we should.  I tried to reach you at your 
             home.
    **Frasier:** I was driving around.
      **Diane:**[_sighs_] I'm sorry if I in any way misled you about my 
             feelings these last few weeks.
    **Frasier:** You didn't.  I think I mislead myself.
      **Diane:** Well, at the very least I obviously owe you an apology for 
             the first time that things went awry between us.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's all right.
      **Diane:** No, it was a time in my life when--
    **Frasier:** No, Diane, it isn't necessary.  The things I said . . . 
             well, they just needed saying.  Besides, I don't really feel 
             all that harshly--and in retrospect, I'm reasonably sure that 
             you are not the devil . . . although he does have the power 
             to assume pleasing shapes.
      **Diane:** Well, you should know I've decided to go back to Los 
             Angeles.  Watching the play tonight through fresh eyes, 
             I--well, I just don't think it's ready.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure things'll work out fine.  Well, I think I've said 
             what I came to say.
      **Diane:** Frasier, um, before you go, there's one last thing you could 
             help me with, not that you haven't helped me a lot already.  
             It's the last scene, where Franklyn and Mary-Ann say 
             goodbye.  It's never felt quite right to me.  I'd like her 
             to stand . . . oh, right about here [_stands in the middle of 
             the stage_] and tell him how much he's meant to her and how 
             she'll never forget him.  How do you suppose . . . 
             "Franklyn" would respond to that?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose he'd tell her that he feels the same way.  
             That she's touched him in a way she can never imagine, he's 
             glad she was in his life.
      **Diane:** All that would be left would be the "goodbye."  How do you 
             see that?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose he could say, uh, "until we meet again," 
             probably certain that they never would.
      **Diane:** But mightn't there be a part of him that hopes they would?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I suppose so, yes.  All right, then, don't have him sum 
             things up.  Just let them say their goodbyes, and if their 
             paths happen to cross again, so be it . . . Goodbye, Mary 
             Ann.
      **Diane:** Goodbye, Franklyn.
    
    _Frasier crosses to the bar door._
    
      **Diane:** Oh yes, that's a perfect moment, uncluttered by any extra 
             words or phrases--
    **Frasier:** Diane.
      **Diane:** Oh shoot, I've blown it!
    **Frasier:** All right, let's try it again. [_stands toe-to-toe with her_]
             Goodbye, Diane.
      **Diane:** Goodbye, Frasier.
    
    _They hug.  He goes out the bar door.  She starts to say something, 
    then he comes back through it._
    
    **Frasier:** Force of habit.
      **Diane:** I've been doing it all week.
    
    _He leaves through the audience rows, waving goodbye._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    _Eddie sits on the couch, chewing one of Martin's socks.  Martin sees 
    him and pulls the sock away, scolding Eddie.
    
    Eddie appears in a spotlight, with a thought bubble saying "I can't 
    help it.  It's what I do."
    
    Eddie pulls another sock out of the couch cushions.  Martin yanks 
    that away too._
