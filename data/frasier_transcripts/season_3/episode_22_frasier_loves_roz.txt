    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - KACL
    Nearing the end of another show._
    
    **Frasier:** Go ahead, Tom.  I'm listening.
        **Tom:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane.  Uh, it's about my girlfriend.
             My problem is, I don't know if I love her for herself 
             Or because things are so great between us physically.
    **Frasier:** Well, how long have you two been together?
        **Tom:** Six years. 
    
    _Frasier is surprised.  Roz mouths, "Wow."_
    
    **Frasier:** And the sex is still that good?
        **Tom:** Oh man, Dr. Crane, every morning, night, three times a day
             on weekends.  But I'm not sure we have much else in common.
    **Frasier:** Well, common interests are of course the foundation of...
             three times, you say?
        **Tom:** Is that abnormal?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, no, no, it's not abnormal.  It's not fair, but it's 
             not abnormal. 
    
    _Roz laughs.  The phone in her booth rings, and she answers._
    
    **Frasier:** Um, but you know, perhaps you share more things than you 
             think you do actually.  I'll tell you what, try this: why 
             don't you pick up a catalogue from a local university, go 
             through it with her and see if there are any courses you'd 
             like to take together?
        **Tom:** That's a good idea!  Thanks, Doc.  Have a great weekend.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'd wish you the same but it hardly seems necessary. 
    
    _He pushes a button to disconnect Tom and sighs.  
    Roz signals him to wrap it up._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that's it for today, Seattle.  This is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane, wishing you all good mental health. [_goes off the 
             air_]
        **Roz:** Niles called from the airport; he wants you to call him back. 
             He sounded frantic!
    **Frasier:**[_walking into her booth_] I'll call him from the car.  He's
             flying to a conference in Switzerland; I promised to talk
             him through it.
        **Roz:** Surely he's flown before?
    **Frasier:** Well, not coach! 
    
    _He pauses, appalled by the lime-green dress with the horrendous 
    pink bow across the midriff hanging behind Roz's console._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, is this the dress you're wearing to the wedding?
        **Roz:** I have to, I'm a bridesmaid.
    **Frasier:**[_trying to be tactful_] Is there a reason it has to be so, 
             so...?
        **Roz:** Hideous?  It's supposed to be, so that way, the bride, 
             By comparison, will glow! [_holding the dress up to her 
             distastefully_] Next to this baby, she'll light up like 
             a bug zapper.  You know, of all my friends in Wisconsin, 
             this girl was the last one I thought would beat me to the 
             altar.
    **Frasier:** Not the Dairy State's comeliest chunk of cheddar?
        **Roz:** Let's just say she works in her father's ice cream parlour
             and she eats her mistakes.  The groom's family makes cones.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, we don't need Freud for that, do we? 
    
    _He has picked up some messages and walks back into his booth. 
    Roz follows, dress in hand. She hangs it up to the window 
    behind Frasier's console._
    
        **Roz:** The whole thing is just so depressing.  Lately everyone I know 
             is settling down, getting married, having children.  What am I 
             doing wrong?
    **Frasier:**[_packing his briefcase_] Well, do you want me to answer as a 
             friend, or a therapist?
        **Roz:** As a friend!
    **Frasier:** See a therapist. [_he turns back to his briefcase_]
        **Roz:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_relenting_] Well, Roz, I think your whole problem stems from 
             some unresolved issues that cause you to choose the men you 
             date.  Always flashy and superficial, offering no prospect 
             of a lasting relationship.
        **Roz:** Why would I do that?
    **Frasier:** Maybe fear of commitment, fear of being hurt.  But maybe 
             it's time you started looking at different kinds of men. 
             You know, men who are more settled, a little less flash 
             and more substance.
        **Roz:** You're probably right, Frasier.  Hey, if I were smart, 
             I'd go out with the next guy I see I'm not the least bit 
             attracted to.
    _As Frasier pulls open the door, laughing, Bulldog comes in, rolling 
    his usual trolley.  He walks over to Roz after wheeling it to the side._
    
    **Bulldog:** Roth, Roth, I juth bit my tongue.  Can you kith it and 
             make it better? [_sticks it out_]
        **Roz:** The next one _after_ him. [_Frasier nods in tacit understanding_]
    **Bulldog:** Oh, Doc, Doc. [_takes a camcorder from the trolley_] Here's 
             my video camera.
    **Frasier:**[_accepting it_] Oh, thank you, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** What do you need it for?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm going to record my father.  I'm going to have his
             life on tape so Frederick can enjoy it in years to come.
        **Roz:** What a good idea!
    **Bulldog:**[_seeing the dress_] Whoa!  That's the ugliest thing I ever saw!
        **Roz:**[_snapping_] I'm going to a wedding.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, I love weddings.  Never been to a wedding where I didn't
             bag at least one bridesmaid.  And the uglier the dress, the
             quicker they want to get out of them.  This one would hit the 
             floor before the rice!
    
    _He goes into the next booth.  Roz checks the clock and takes the dress down._
    
        **Roz:** I've got to get going.  Can you believe I actually have to 
             be seen in public in this thing?
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, it's only for a few hours.  After that you can 
             donate it to the Salvation Army... and one day make some 
             Irish drag queen very happy.
    
    _Roz laughs.  They go their separate ways.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **NO ONE SAID ANYTHING 
    PARTICULARLY AMUSING FOR TWO WEEKS, 
    AND THEN...**
    
    _Scene Two - Cafe Nervosa
    Niles and Frasier are enjoying a coffee together._
    
      **Niles:** What's the point of going to Switzerland without spending a
             day on the slopes?  So I ducked out of the conference and who
             should I run into, but Maris?  She'd just flown in for her
             yearly goat placenta treatments!
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, is it placenta treatment time again already?
      **Niles:** We had a set-to on the slopes.  She ran, I tried to follow
             her tracks in the snow, but alas, she made none.
    _A tall, bearded man in glasses walks into the cafe and stands in line._
      **Niles:**[_putting a hand to his face_] Oh, dear...
    **Frasier:** What is it?  What's the matter?
      **Niles:** I just spotted someone.  It's my least favorite patient.  
             The man's a compulsive womaniser.  He goes through so 
             many women, he calls them all by the same odious nickname, 
             "Sunshine," to avoid slip-ups.
    **Frasier:** Oh, God.
      **Niles:** Frasier, what do you do when you don't like a patient?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a tricky subject, isn't it? [_Niles nods_] 
             How long have you been seeing him?
      **Niles:** Six months.  We've made no progress whatsover.  Sometimes I
             feel he comes in not so much for help as to brag.  He claims
             to have been with, at last count, one hundred and fifty women!
    **Frasier:** Oh puh-leease!  A hundred and fifty!
      **Niles:** As if anything over, say... seven weren't absurd.
    **Frasier:** Well, I would say eleven, but I get your point.
    
    _Behind Frasier's back, Niles sees the man now embracing Roz._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, now serving one hundred and fifty-one.
    **Frasier:**[_turns and gasps_] Good God!  He's here to see Roz?
      **Niles:** Yes, well, no doubt they met when Sealy Posturepedic named
             them Man and Woman of the Year.
    **Frasier:**[_panicking_] Niles, you don't understand.  She-she's
             been very vulnerable lately.
      **Niles:**[_getting up and taking his coat_] Well, I hope you'll forgive 
             me if I don't stick around. I'd like to leave before she makes
             introductions.
    **Frasier:** I've got to warn her!
      **Niles:**[_alarmed_] Warn her how?  What I just told you was in 
             strict confidence, therapist to therapist. You can't 
             go repeating it! 
    **Frasier:** But-but-
      **Niles:**_No!_
    **Frasier:** Oh... of course, of course, you're right, I won't.  
             But that is the last man that Roz should be with!
      **Niles:** Well, don't worry.  Knowing Roz, he won't be.
    
    _Niles leaves in a hurry just as Roz spots Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_uncomfortably_] Oh, Roz!
        **Roz:** I'd like to introduce you to someone.  This is Ben Collins.
    **Frasier:**[_standing and shaking his hand, obviously discomfited_]
             Frasier Crane, pleasure.
        **Ben:** Likewise.
        **Roz:** Is it all right if we join you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, why not??
        **Ben:** I'll grab our coffees.
    
    _Ben leaves as Roz comes and settles in across from Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** He is the greatest guy!  You know, when I first met him, 
             I thought, "He's not my type."  Then I remembered what you 
             said.  And I'm so glad you gave me that advice, Frasier, 
             because without it, I would never have given him a second 
             look.
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, let's not rule out that all-important third look.
        **Roz:** Would you stop worrying about me, Frasier?  This one's
             different.  I can tell he really cares about me.
    
    _At this moment, Ben returns and saves Frasier from his obvious discomfort._
    
        **Ben:**[_ominously_] Here you go, Sunshine!
    _Frasier looks up at Ben with a suspicious smile plastered on his face.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **ANOTHER CURIOUSLY UNAMUSING WEEK PASSED, UNTIL...**
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's apartment
    Martin enters through the front door._
    
     **Martin:** Why can't you be like other dogs?  Why can't you bring home 
             bones or animals you kill? 
    
    _Eddie follows into the apartment almost sheepishly, holding a
    few yellow tulips in his mouth._
    
     **Martin:**[_taking the flowers_] Give me those!  Relax, I'm just going to 
             put them with the roses you picked yesterday.
    
    _Frasier comes in._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh hey, Dad!  Fresh from your walk?  I think now is as good 
             a time as any to crank up the ol' camcorder.
     **Martin:** Nah, maybe later.
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad, you've been saying "no" for weeks now!
     **Martin:** Well, gee, some people would take that for a hint!
    **Frasier:** All you have to do is just sit here and talk about your
             life.
     **Martin:** Life's got nothing to do with it!  This is about me dying 
             and you having something to look at after I'm dead. The whole
             thing gives me the creeps!
    **Frasier:** I can't believe you're refusing to record your history, the
             story that only you, Martin Crane, can tell, because it gives 
             you the creeps!
     **Martin:** OK then, I'll tell you the real truth. [_mockingly holds the 
             limp tulips to the back of his head_] My Indian heritage 
             forbids it.  I'm afraid your magic box will rob me of my 
             spirit.
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier goes to answer it._
    
    **Frasier:** I don't know why you're being so negative about this.  It's
             not really for when you're dead.  It's for when you've lost
             your mind.
    
    _Martin leaves the room.  Frasier opens the door to Roz._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Oh hello, Roz!  Why, after waiting for forty-five 
             minutes, did I assume you'd forgotten our appointment?
        **Roz:** Sorry, but uh... I was on my way out, when Ben called.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes... Ben. 
        **Roz:** Oh, what's with you?  Every time I bring him up, you make that
             face.  I'm getting the sense that you don't like him that much.
    **Frasier:** It's just that I know something about Ben...
        **Roz:** What?
    **Frasier:**[_improvising_] He's a little old for you.
        **Roz:** He's thirty-six!
    **Frasier:** Exactly my point! [_clumsily_] When you were a freshman, he was 
             a senior.  That never works out! [_changes the subject_] 
             I'm getting my briefcase!
       **Roz:** I'll go get a Coke.
    
    _Frasier walks off toward his bedroom; Roz walks into the kitchen and
    sees Daphne there, just generally puttering around._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, hi, Daphne! [_gets a Coke from the fridge_]
     **Daphne:** Hello, Roz.  How are you?
        **Roz:** OK... can I ask you something?  Does Frasier seem weird 
             to you-?
     **Daphne:** Oh God, yes.
        **Roz:** I haven't finished my question yet.
     **Daphne:** Yes, well, when you know the answer, it's hard not to hit the
             buzzer.
        **Roz:**[_laughs, then_] Well, this is strange.  I mean, for the 
             first time in years, I'm in a really solid relationship, 
             and instead of being happy for me, Frasier seems upset.
     **Daphne:** Oh, that _is_ odd.  Unless... 
        **Roz:** Unless what?
     **Daphne:** Well... [_conspiratorial_] Dr. Crane is jealous of Ben
             because he wants you for himself.
        **Roz:**_Huh?_ [_laughs_] Ohhh, no, no, no!
     **Daphne:** Yes, what else could it be?
        **Roz:** Fra-Frasier?  What, you really think so? [_pushes Daphne 
             playfully_] Daphne, no!  No way!  No, he doesn't - Frasier 
             is the one who told me to find myself a new boyfriend.  
             Someone who is settled, someone more nurturing, someone 
             with substance over flash.
     **Daphne:** They could put that on Dr. Crane's tombstone.
        **Roz:**[_starting to believe it_] Oh, come on!  No way!
     **Daphne:** Yes!  Wait, there's something else. 
        **Roz:** What?
     **Daphne:** I probably shouldn't tell you this.  But earlier this morning, 
             Dr. Crane was on the phone with his brother and he said that 
             your relationship with Ben was driving him crazy, [_Roz's jaw 
             drops_] and that he was dying to tell you but he can't.
        **Roz:**[_almost screeching_] Oh my God, did you hear him say that?!
     **Daphne:** I certainly did!
        **Roz:** Oh, this is too weird, this is too weird!  What am I going to 
             say?  Maybe I won't say anything.  Maybe he'll just see how 
             happy I am with Ben.
    
    _Frasier storms into the kitchen, banging around._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben!  My God, Roz, would you just drop it with
             Ben for a minute and pay some attention to me? [_storms back out_]
        **Roz:** Oh-kaay!
    
    _She picks up her coke and leaves the kitchen after exchanging a
    glance with the knowing Daphne.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four - KACL 
    Frasier is sitting in his booth, reading a magazine.  Roz enters from 
    his door and stops short, seeming a bit embarrassed to see him._
    
    **Frasier:** Morning, Roz!
        **Roz:**[_nervous_] Hi, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Hey, you look lovely, that colour's very flattering!
        **Roz:** Thanks.
    **Frasier:** You know, I think this calls for a hug!
        **Roz:**[_backing away instinctively_] Oh, I don't look that good.
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, no, Roz.  Look! [_holds up the magazine_] 
             My God, the ratings are in, and we did better in our timeslot 
             this week than ever before!  Congratulations, partner!
    
    _He folds her into a hug, which she returns very uncomfortably._
    
    **Frasier:** Why don't we have dinner tonight, celebrate?
        **Roz:** That sounds so fun... but I kinda have plans.
    **Frasier:** I should have known. [_laughs uneasily_] Another time, perhaps.
        **Roz:** Yeah sure, that sounds great.
    
    _She moves off into her booth just as Bulldog enters Frasier's._
    
    **Bulldog:** Yo, Doc.  When are you going to return my video camera?  
             I got a hot date tonight and I want to record certain events 
             for posterity, if you know what I mean.
    **Frasier:** Uh... tomorrow, Bulldog. [_Bulldog starts to protest_] Well, 
             maybe tonight you could just have a police sketch artist 
             crouch on your balcony.
    
    _Bulldog seems to accept this suggestion and leaves.  
    Frasier gets up and heads into Roz's booth._
    
        **Roz:**[_on the phone as she files her nails_] So Mom, let me ask you 
             something.  How long did you know Dad before you told him you
             loved him?  Mom?  Mom?  Mom, you've been divorced fifteen 
             years!  Let it go! 
    
    _She doesn't notice Frasier come in behind her._
    
        **Roz:** Listen, Ben is coming over to dinner tonight, and I think 
             I'm going to tell him I love him.
    _Frasier is so flustered by this that he drops the tape he was carrying. 
    Roz, startled by the noise, hangs up quickly._
    
        **Roz:** I gotta work, bye!
    **Frasier:**[_fumbling_] Oh I'm, I'm sorry, Roz. I should have knocked.
        **Roz:**[_just as flustered_] It's OK, it's OK, it's OK!
    **Frasier:** I couldn't help overhearing the last part of your
             conversation there.  You think you're not rushing things 
             a little bit with Ben?  Are you really that serious?
        **Roz:** Yes, I am.
    **Frasier:** But you know, there are a lot of men in the world.
        **Roz:** And lots of women, too!
    **Frasier:**[_beat_] Well, that's more of a personal preference but I... 
    
    _He hurries into his booth.  Roz, confused, follows him._
    
        **Roz:** I meant for you!  Look, Frasier, what I'm trying to say is 
             I know you have a problem with me and Ben, but we're happy 
             together.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just that you've only been going out for a month!
        **Roz:** Well, sometimes, that's all it takes. [_noticing the time_]
             Fifteen seconds!  Listen Frasier, I'd like to think that
             there's some small part of you that is happy for me.  After
             all, it WAS your advice that got me this far! 
    **Frasier:** Of course I'm happy for you. 
        **Roz:** Thanks.
    _She goes into her booth, closes the door, and hits a button on her 
    console._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to himself_] Me and my stupid advice... [_notices the "On-Air" 
             light_] will be with you for the next three hours, Seattle!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Frasier's apartment.
    That afternoon, Niles is sitting on the couch with the 
    video camera, trying to persuade Martin to do the tape._
    
     **Martin:** I'm not doing it, it's morbid.
      **Niles:** It's not morbid.  And besides, if you don't do it, the only
             footage we'll have of you in the family archives is you
             pretending your stomach was a face that summer at the lake.
     **Martin:**[_puts down his paper_] Alright Niles, if it'll shut 
             you up, I'll do it.
      **Niles:** Thanks, Dad!  We'll make this quick and easy. [_he adjusts the
             camcorder, then looks at Martin_] Is that what you're wearing? 
     **Martin:** Forget it. [_picks up the paper again_]
      **Niles:** No, no no, all right.  Here we go, here we go. [_starts 
             recording_] OK...
    
    _P.O.V. Through the viewfinder of the camera:_
    
     **Martin:** My name's Martin Crane.  When I made this tape, I was sixty-
             four years old.  But now... I'm _DEAD!_ 
    
    _Niles starts getting disconcerted._ 
    
     **Martin:** Trapped in a box, underground... [_chuckles_] Pretty scary, huh? 
    _He throws his head back and laughs evilly.  Niles stops the tape._
    
      **Niles:** Dad, surely you must have some message you want to leave for 
             the Cranes of the twenty-first century?
     **Martin:** Alright, alright, I do. [_Niles starts the tape again_] 
             Remember to always work hard, and that family comes first. 
             And... I have a million bucks in unmarked bills that I took 
             off a drug dealer that I have stashed in my old army foot 
             locker. The combination is left fifteen, right thirty-two, 
             le-le... 
    
    _He starts choking and kicks back in his Barcalounger, shaking, 
    his tongue lolling out of his mouth.  By now, Niles has given up. 
    He turns the camcorder onto himself._
    
      **Niles:** Future generations: see what I had to put up with?
    
    _Frasier enters the apartment._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello.
     **Martin:** Hello. [_getting up_]
      **Niles:**[_to Frasier_] Hello. [_to Martin_] I suppose this means we're
             finished?
     **Martin:** Well, unless you want future generations to see me go to
             the can! [_he goes off_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, actually I'm glad you're here.  I have to talk to you
             about Roz.
      **Niles:** Oh, no, no, no.  I've breached my ethics once already.
    **Frasier:** Niles, please, I've gotten desperate! 
      **Niles:**[_puts his fingers in his ears_] No, no, no!
    **Frasier:** Niles, she plans to tell him that she loves him tonight!
             [_Niles takes his fingers out_] From what you told me about 
             Ben's patterns, that will be the end of it and Roz will be 
             shattered.  God, there has got to be some loophole in this 
             confidentiality rule that will allow me to warn her and still 
             preserve your ethics. [_looks at the bookcase_] Niles!  Help me 
             look through these textbooks!
      **Niles:**[_starts leaving_] No, I'll have no part in this!
    **Frasier:** Please, Niles!  Think of Roz!
      **Niles:** I'm thinking of my license!
    **Frasier:** Well then, think of what Freud said!  "We are never so
             helplessly unhappy as when we lose love." 
    
    _Niles stops at the door and turns back reluctantly._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, all right!  But that was dirty pool, using a Freud 
             quotation. 
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** It's the Crane boys' kryptonite.
    **Frasier:** I know, I know.  Thank you.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Six
    Obviously, time passes.  The two brothers are seated at the coffee
    table, poring over psychiatry books, ties loosened and Niles has 
    his jacket off._
    
    **Frasier:** Say, here's a possibility.  According to this, it says we 
             can warn her if he means to do her bodily harm.  Does he?
      **Niles:** No.
    **Frasier:** Damn!
      **Niles:** It would be so much easier if Roz were mentally incompetent.
    
    _They stop poring and look up, interested._
    
    **Frasier:** Go on...
      **Niles:** Well, then there'd be some justification for protecting her.
             [_puts down his textbook_] Is she irrational?
    **Frasier:** She did attack a vending machine once, when a Twinkie came
             out of the Oreo chute.
      **Niles:** Borderline, borderline.  Does she ever act delusional?
    **Frasier:** Well, she often claims that _she_ is responsible for the
             success of our show.
      **Niles:** Building, building.  Does she display below-average 
             intelligence?
    **Frasier:**[_triumphantly_] She once ordered a bottle of _white_ Zinfandel!
      **Niles:** Jackpot! [_stands and points at the door_] Go to her, she's a 
             threat to herself!
    **Frasier:** It's amazing they even let the woman drive!
    
    _He rushes out.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **BRIDESMAID REVISITED**
    
    _Scene Seven - Roz's apartment
    Frasier pounds on Roz's door._
    
        **Roz:**[_from inside_] Who is it?
    **Frasier:** It's Frasier!
    _Roz pulls it open: she looks a mess.  She's clad in the awful lime-
    green bridesmaid's dress, her hair wildly tangled and her mascara 
    smeared so much so that her eyes resemble that of a panda's. 
    A decidedly unlovely sight._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my God!  What happened?
        **Roz:**[_sobbing_] He dumped me, Frasier!
    _She falls back from the door.  He follows her in, and hugs her.  
    He notices a bottle of champagne on the table, with two glasses._
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, honey!  I - come here.  Oh God...
        **Roz:** Everything was going great! [_sinks into a dining chair_] 
             Until I said "I love you, Ben."  Then he got this look 
             on his face, like he'd taken a wrong turn in a really 
             bad neighbourhood!  He didn't even touch the champagne.
    **Frasier:** Oh I'm... I'm sorry, Roz.  Here. [_hands her a handkerchief_]
        **Roz:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** When you... [_she blows her nose loudly_] when you professed 
             your love for him, uh... were you dressed like that?
        **Roz:** No!  After he left, I went in to change, and I saw all these
             old bridesmaid dresses hanging in the closet.  And that's 
             when it hit me.  That's what I am, a bridesmaid!  I might 
             as well wear the uniform!
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, no, no!  Now, now, come on! 
        **Roz:** Yes!
    **Frasier:** Come on!  Now look, look, you know, I find that whenever 
             I'm low, it always lifts my spirits when I just spruce up a 
             bit.  It wouldn't hurt to run a brush through your hair... 
             or through your teeth.
        **Roz:** Oh God! [_pushes him back and goes to the dresser_] I must look 
             awful!
    **Frasier:** No, no, not at all.
        **Roz:** You're a big fat liar. [_turns back to the mirror_] But you were 
             right about Ben, and I just didn't see it.  What made you come 
             over here anyway?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, I was coming over here to take one last stab 
             at convincing you that Ben was the wrong man for you.  You 
             deserve someone better, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, yeah, [_trying to tug a brush through her snarled hair_] 
             I'm a real catch! [_gives up and sinks onto her bed_] Hell...
    **Frasier:** Oh, now, things really aren't all as dark as they seem.
             You know, you're a-a beautiful, intelligent, desirable... 
    
    _She just looks at him, the brush dangling from her hair._
    
    **Frasier:** Why don't you let me just take a stab at that, will you? 
             [_starts brushing her hair out_] I can't imagine any man not 
             thinking himself the luckiest in the world to be with you.
        **Roz:** You really do... think that, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, and I'm surprised you even had to ask me that.
        **Roz:** I guess I didn't.  I've known that you've had these romantic
             feelings toward me, for a while.
    **Frasier:**[_shell-shocked_] What?
        **Roz:** Oh come on!  Don't deny it.  Those hints about finding 
             someone with substance over style, the way you hated Ben.  
             And then Daphne told me she overheard you telling Niles that 
             you couldn't stop thinking about me and wanted to tell me the
             truth!
    **Frasier:** Daphne told you that?
        **Roz:** Yeah - don't be mad at her.
    **Frasier:** No, no, I'm not.  It's just that when she said that...
        **Roz:** No it's OK, Frasier.  I'm glad she told me.  The only thing
             keeping me from completely falling apart right now is
             knowing that someone like you could be interested in me.
    _Frasier thinks fast, but is unable to say anything more effective._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, then... there's no point in denying it, is there? 
    _He starts brushing her hair mechanically, placing a hand on her 
    head and dragging the brush through her hair.  This motion becomes 
    repeatedly rougher._
    
        **Roz:** You know, maybe the idea of you and me isn't so crazy.  
             You _are_ the kind of man I should be with!  Smart, gentle... 
             Ow!  I said gentle!
    **Frasier:**[_stops brushing_] Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roz.  
             Uh, you know, it's just that there are so many...
        **Roz:** I know, I know.  Workplace romances always fail. 
    **Frasier:** Exactly my point!
        **Roz:** And I'm on the rebound.  I've got to give myself time to
             heal. 
    **Frasier:**[_nods enthusiastically_] Yes yes, lots of time.
    
    _Pause._
    
        **Roz:** On the other hand, you are the one who always says the best
             relationships start with friendship.
    **Frasier:** Well, I do say that, yes.  It's true, but...
        **Roz:** And we're friends, aren't we?
    **Frasier:**[_smiles_] We're very good friends.
        **Roz:** Right now we are both free.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, in my case, painfully free.
        **Roz:**[_suggestively_] You know, maybe if we both went into it 
             with our eyes open...?
    
    _They move closer together, and look into each other's eyes. 
    They seem about to kiss, and then they break apart, laughing._
    
        **Roz:** Oh no, what am I saying?  My relationship with you is 
             probably the healthiest one I've ever had with a man!  
             I don't want to screw that up.
    **Frasier:** Now that you mention it, my relationship with you is
             probably the best one I've ever had with a woman!
             [_dejectedly_] Not that it's been much of a horse race, 
             but...
    
    _They sit at the dinner table.  She picks up a champagne glass._
    
        **Roz:** To friendship?
    **Frasier:**[_takes the other_] Here's hoping the next time you tell 
             a man you love him, he says it back.
    
    _They clink glasses, and drink._
    
        **Roz:** Well, let's see.  I love you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** I love you too, Roz. [_she laughs_] You gonna be alright?
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'd better run. [_gets up_]
        **Roz:** Yeah, my saying "I love you" seems to have that effect on
             men.
    **Frasier:** No, no, I'll-I'll stay if you like!
        **Roz:** No, no.  Don't you worry about me.  I will not be alone.  
             I will be sliding into a hot tub with my good friends, 
             Ben & Jerry.
    **Frasier:** See you tomorrow, Roz.
        **Roz:** See you, Frasier. 
    
    _She pats him on the back and he closes the door behind him._
    
    _We see both Frasier and Roz hesitating on their respective sides 
    of the door, possibly wondering what being together would be like.  
    Then she realizes she hasn't heard him leave yet.  He catches himself 
    and runs away as quickly as possible.
    
    End Of Act Two._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    We see Roz in her bedroom-cum-living-room, packing all her bridesmaid 
    dresses into a cardboard box. She does so determinedly and almost 
    proudly, as if she were making a definitive break with her past.  
    Picking up the box, she brings it to the door and passes it to a 
    delivery man outside, who in turn hands her a receipt of sorts. 
    She closes the door with finality. 
    
    We then see the delivery man standing outside Roz's apartment, holding 
    the lime-green dress up from the box speculatively. 
    
    The scene changes to a street pavement, and we see the same delivery 
    man with the dress on, complete with make-up and long, curly red wig.  
    He walks proudly towards the screen as Roz walks by him, and as he 
    disappears off-screen, she halts and turns, her mouth dropping open 
    in recognition.
