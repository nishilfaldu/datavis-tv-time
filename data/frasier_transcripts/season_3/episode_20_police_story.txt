    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Street - Night
    Frasier is driving at breakneck speed, with a highly agitated Roz in 
    the passenger seat._
    
        **Roz:** Faster, Frasier, faster! [_throws her leg across and stamps 
             the accelerator_] You can make this light!
    **Frasier:** God, you're going to get us killed!
        **Roz:** I can't be late for this date!
    **Frasier:** Oh, this is ridiculous!  First the drycleaner, then the ATM, 
             now you're making me cart you off to some restaurant!
        **Roz:** Well, I'm sorry, I didn't plan for my car to be in the shop.  
             But I really, really appreciate it, Frasier. [_starts 
             unbuttoning her shirt_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, a basket of fruit would suffice!
        **Roz:** I am changing for my date!  Don't look at me!  Turn around!  
             Turn all the way around!
    **Frasier:** I'm driving!
        **Roz:** Fine! [_climbs into the backseat_] Hand me my jeans, will you?
    **Frasier:** Here. [_hands them to her, then checks the rearview_] Oh, oh, 
             great!  There's a police car behind us.  Please don't turn 
             on the red light.  Don't turn on the red light.  Don't turn 
             on the--
    
    _Siren.  Frasier moans and pulls over._
     
        **Roz:** Damn it, Frasier!  Don't worry, you're not going to get a 
             ticket.  You're a celebrity, use a little juice!
    **Frasier:** Oh, I refuse to do anything of the sort!
        **Roz:** OK, fine.  Enjoy traffic school.
    _The traffic cop walks up to his side.  Frasier rolls down his window._
    **Frasier:** Hello, officer.  I'm listening.
    _The cop -- an attractive red-haired woman -- bends down, all business.
    _
        **Cop:** I clocked you doing sixty-two in a forty-mile zone.
    
    _She shines her flashlight in the backseat.  Roz, still half out of 
    her jeans, waves sheepishly._
    
        **Cop:** Well, this is interesting.  Usually both people are in the 
             backseat.
    **Frasier:** It's not what you think.  See, we were just coming back from 
             KACL, where I do my radio show. 
        **Cop:** Uh-huh.
    **Frasier:** You see, we ran a little late, because I was on with a very 
             troubled caller, with a very complex psychological problem... 
             on my radio show.
        **Cop:** Hey, wait a minute.  You're Dr. Frasier Crane!
    **Frasier:** Drat!  My cover is blown.
        **Cop:** I love your show!  I listen to it all the time.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, thank you.  It's always nice to--
        **Cop:** License and registration, please.
    **Frasier:** Be arrested by a fan.
    _He hands them over.  Roz, who has not halted her pre-date preparation, 
    leans forward to the rearview mirror and sprays perfume on her neck._
    **Frasier:** Roz, if you could delay ablutions?  I'm in custody here!
        **Cop:** Hey, it's your birthday today. [_re: Roz_] Is this a little 
             celebration?
    **Frasier:** No, no, I'm simply taking my producer to meet her date.
        **Roz:** Frasier, why didn't you tell me it was your birthday?  I'd 
             have thrown you a party at the station!
    **Frasier:** Question asked, question answered. [_to cop_] I'm just going 
             to be dropping her off, then have a cold plate of deli, and 
             get to bed early.  Almost makes you feel sorry for me, 
             doesn't it?
        **Cop:** I spent my last birthday subduing a drunk-and-disorderly at 
             a sleazy bar.
    **Frasier:** Don't you hate to work on your birthday?
        **Cop:** He was my date.  Tell you what I'm going to do.  I'm going 
             to let you off. [_hands his license back_] Just think of this 
             as a little birthday gift from me.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
        **Cop:** But slow down.  I'd hate to see you get hurt.
    **Frasier:** I'm listening.
    _The cop laughs and goes back to her car.  Roz slides into the front._
        **Roz:** OK, let's go!
    **Frasier:** Do you sense a little moment there?
        **Roz:**[_"Why are we not moving?!"_] What are you talking about?!
    **Frasier:** Well, between me and that very attractive officer.  It just 
             felt like there was something there.
        **Roz:** Yeah, major sparks.  Now, just the right pedal.  The big 
             pedal--
    **Frasier:** Now, just a minute. [_adjusts the rearview_] We'll see if 
             she's watching me.  If she's watching me, she's interested.  
             Oh, yes!  She's turning around, she's looking up!
        **Cop:**[_over bullhorn_] Move your vehicle!
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  I've cast my spell.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Apartment
    Frasier sits at the dinner table before a birthday cake.  Martin, 
    Niles, and Daphne stand over him.  Eddie is in a chair._
    
     **Daphne:** Go on, Dr. Crane, make a wish.
    **Frasier:**[_making evil eyes at Eddie_] Oh, why bother?  I made the same 
             wish last year, it didn't come true.
     **Martin:** Come on, son, blow out the candles!
    
    _Frasier draws breath, and blows out the candles, which promptly 
    light again -- trick candles.  Daphne and Martin laugh, Niles applauds 
    lightly._
    
    **Frasier:**[_dry, sarcastic_] Oh, what a surprise.  Look, they're lighting 
             again!  What sorcerer's magic is this? [_cuts the cake_] You 
             know, Dad, I had a nice little birthday bonus today.  On my 
             way home, I was pulled over for speeding by a very pretty 
             policewoman, who let me off.  I got the distinct impression 
             that she found me attractive.  Now, that sort of thing 
             happens, doesn't it?
     **Martin:** Oh, sure.  I was always leaning against somebody's window 
             thinking, "that bloody chainsaw in the backseat looks kind 
             of iffy, but she's got a cute smile!"
    **Frasier:** Oh, ha, ha.  I'm telling you, there was something there, 
             though.  Well, of course the whole conversation's academic.  
             I don't even know her name.  I suppose I could call down to 
             the police station and try to find out who was on traffic 
             duty.  But, uh, I don't suppose they'd give that sort of 
             information to a civilian.  You'd have to have some... 
             conduit to the police department, an insider who could break 
             that damnable code of silence!
     **Martin:** All right, I'll make the damn call. [_goes to the phone_]
    **Frasier:** You, Dad?  Why, I didn't even think of--
     **Martin:** Oh, shut up.
    **Frasier:** You know, I haven't felt such an instant attraction to a woman 
             in quite some time.  Well, considering the difference in our 
             backgrounds, it's really rather puzzling.
      **Niles:** Oh, pish-tosh!  It's painfully obvious what's attracting you --
             the gleam of her jackboots, her dangling nightstick, the glint 
             of her handcuffs hanging on her leather belt.  You're off on 
             some lurid little disciplinary fantasy.
     **Daphne:**[_notices_] Oh, Dr. Crane, shame on you!  You got icing up and 
             down your sleeve!
      **Niles:** Oh.  I am a naughty boy.
    
    _She leads him to the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, certainly a messy one.
      **Niles:** But mainly a naughty one.
     **Martin:**[_on phone_] Hey, Charlie, yeah, Marty Crane, how ya doing?  
             Hey, listen, Charlie, I'm trying to track down a woman 
             officer who was on traffic tonight, uh, near...
    **Frasier:** Blanchett and Fourth.
     **Martin:** Blanchett and Fourth.  Great, OK, thanks. [_hangs up_] Her 
             name's Maureen Cutler, and she usually goes to McGinty's 
             after work.  Charlie said she's probably there now.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.
     **Martin:** Are you going to go?
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know.  A police bar?  If I go in there alone, 
             I'll stand out like a sore thumb!
      **Niles:** All right, I'll go.
     **Martin:** Sit down, Niles, I'll go with him.  You know, after all these 
             hoity-toity, caviar-sucking egghead types you've been dating, 
             I think a lady cop would be a nice breath of fresh air.
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right, I'll go!  Give me a second, I'll put some fresh 
             collar-stays in, and-oh, oh, I've got a fabulous brand-new 
             cashmere jacket I've been dying to premiere!
    
    _He runs into his room._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah.  This is gonna work.
    _FADE TO:_
    **SINS OF THE FATHER**
    
    _Scene Three -- McGinty's
    The bar is packed with off-duty cops and other working stiffs.  
    Martin, dressed in a letterman jacket, stands next to Frasier, 
    who stands out like a sore thumb in his suit._
    
     **Martin:** You see her yet?
    **Frasier:** I don't know.
     **Martin:**[_pointing_] What about her?
    **Frasier:** No, that's not Maureen.
     **Martin:** No, I mean, what about _her_?
    **Frasier:** Oh, there she is!
    
    _The cop (Maureen), in casual dress, is standing over by the jukebox, 
    joking with a friend._
    
     **Martin:** Wow, she is a looker!  Well, come on, let's go say hello.
    _They go over.  As Maureen catches sight of them, Frasier smotes his 
    forehead in feigned surprise._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh well!  Oh my God, fancy seeing you here!
    **Maureen:** Hey, Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you remember me?
    **Maureen:** Come on -- sixty-two in a forty-mile zone with a half-naked 
             girl in the backseat?
    
    _Frasier chuckles, but Martin looks shocked._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz.
     **Martin:** Oh.
    _Frasier introduces Martin._
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh, this is my father.
    **Maureen:** How do you do?  I'm Maureen Cutler.
     **Martin:**[_shaking hands_] Marty Crane, nice to meet you.
    **Maureen:** Nice to meet you.
     **Martin:** Say, Maureen, how about a drink?
    **Maureen:** Yeah, why not?
    **Frasier:** Let me get them.  I'm a beer drinker myself, what about you?
    **Maureen:** That's fine by me.
     **Martin:** Beer, huh?  Oh, what the hell, I'll try one.
    
    _Frasier goes to the bar.  Martin and Maureen sit at a table._
    
    **Maureen:** So, what brings you guys here?  This is mostly a cop hangout.
     **Martin:** Well, I used to be on the force.
    **Maureen:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Maureen:** Wait a minute.  Marty Crane?  You're Martin Crane!
     **Martin:** You're wasting your time in traffic, you're quite a detective. 
             [_laughs_]
    **Maureen:** No, I mean I remember you when I was training.  You gave this 
             great lecture at the academy on how to deal with an armed 
             suspect.
     **Martin:** Well, thanks.
    **Maureen:** How come you left the force?
     **Martin:** Well, I uh, got shot by an armed suspect. [_laughs_]
    **Maureen:** I'm sorry.
     **Martin:** Oh, it's all right.
    **Maureen:** So, do you miss it?
     **Martin:** Nah, how attached can you get to a hip?
    
    _They laugh.  Maureen's beeper goes off._
    
    **Maureen:** Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry. [_gets up_] I have to get over to the 
             hospital.  I told them to beep me if there was any news 
             about my sergeant.
     **Martin:** What happened to him?
    **Maureen:** She's having a baby.
     **Martin:** Oh well, hope it's a girl!  Yeah, I'll tell Frasier you had 
             to run.
    **Maureen:** Thanks... listen, um, I never do this, but I would love 
             to have a beer or go to dinner sometime.
     **Martin:**[_taken aback_] With me?
    **Maureen:** I don't want to put you on the spot. [_gives him her card_] If 
             you, uh, if you want to go out, just give me a call.
     **Martin:** With me?
    **Maureen:** You're the only one here.
    
    _Frasier comes back with three beers._
    
    **Frasier:** Here we are!  Three beers.  Good news, there was a fly in 
             one glass, so these are free!
    **Maureen:** I'm sorry, I just got beeped.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's too bad.
    **Maureen:** Yeah, but it was nice to see you.  Maybe I'll bump into you 
             again here sometime.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that'd be great.
    **Maureen:** OK, bye.
    **Frasier:** Bye.
    
    _Maureen leaves._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I think that went very well, don't you?
    
    _Martin is speechless.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Niles is sitting at a corner table.  The Waitress takes his order._
    
       **Niles:** I'll have a grande half-caf latte, with a whisper of 
              cinnamon.  And for my father, plain coffee.  I cannot 
              emphasize the word "plain" enough.  No foam, no cinnamon, 
              no exotic flavors.  If it is not plain, I take no 
              responsibility for the consequences.
    **Waitress:** How about a biscotti?
       **Niles:** All right.  But when you bring it, call it a cookie.
    
    _The Waitress leaves, Martin walks in._
    
      **Martin:** Hi, son.
       **Niles:** Hello, Dad.
      **Martin:** Uh, I want to thank you for meeting me like this.
       **Niles:** Well, my pleasure. [_they sit_] So... what can I do you for?
      **Martin:** Well, I need some advice.
       **Niles:** That's why you asked me here?
      **Martin:** Yeah.
       **Niles:** You've never done this before!
      **Martin:** Yeah, well, I'm sorry.  But anyway, you remember--
       **Niles:** Dad, I want you to know I'm not only deeply touched, but I 
              consider this a watershed moment in our relationship!
      **Martin:** Great.  See, the thing is--
       **Niles:** All my life, it seems you've always turned to Frasier.  
              "Frasier, Frasier, Frasier!"
      **Martin:** Niles, can I talk?!
       **Niles:** I'm listening.
    
    _The Waitress brings their coffees._
    
    **Waitress:** Here we are.  One latte, one coffee, and one [_looks at 
              Niles_] "cookie."
      **Martin:** I think they call this thing a biscotti.
       **Niles:** No need to talk down to the man.  Off you go!
    
    _The waitress leaves._
    
      **Martin:** Well, anyway, uh, you remember the other night, Frasier's 
              policewoman?
       **Niles:** Mmm-hmm.
      **Martin:** Well, we found her at the bar, and, uh, well, she came on to 
              me.
       **Niles:** No.
      **Martin:** Yeah.
       **Niles:** You?
      **Martin:** Yeah.
       **Niles:** Was she drunk? [_Martin glares_] Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, of course, 
              you're right, I'm sorry.  Uh, [_barely able to contain his 
              delight_] what was Frasier's reaction?
      **Martin:** I haven't told him yet.
       **Niles:** Why not?
      **Martin:** I just can't.
       **Niles:** Can I?
      **Martin:** I know he's going to feel lousy.  He finally meets a girl he 
              likes, and she's attracted to his old man.
       **Niles:** Hmm, that is quite a conundrum.  I wonder if that's what's 
              really bothering you.
      **Martin:** What do you mean?
       **Niles:** Maybe, underneath it all, you're attracted to this woman and 
              you want to go out with her.
      **Martin:** Oh, are you, nuts?  That's sick!  That's disgusting!
    
    _Niles shrugs to say, "it's just a theory."_
    
      **Martin:** But for the sake of argument, let's say you're right.
       **Niles:** Dad, you're allowed to be attracted to a woman.
      **Martin:** What kind of a father does a thing like that?
       **Niles:** Did you encourage her in any way?
      **Martin:** Well, I guess I was kind of charming.  I mean, I didn't mean 
              to be!  It just sometimes leaks out.
       **Niles:** Well, what do you want to do?
      **Martin:** Well, most important I don't want to hurt Frasier.  And 
              secondly, I want to go out with Maureen.  The order of that 
              changes depending on the time of day.
       **Niles:** Well, one possibility is, go on a date with her.  If you feel 
              there are sparks between you and this woman, then tell 
              Frasier.
      **Martin:** I don't want to lie to my son.
       **Niles:** You're not lying to him.  You're delaying the truth to spare 
              his feelings.  If nothing happens, he need never know.
      **Martin:** Well, I guess it's worth a try.  If Maureen and I hit it off, 
              then I'll tell him immediately.
       **Niles:** Or I can.  Really, I don't mind!
    
    _Martin gives him a look.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Apartment
    Martin walks toward the door, looking around like a guilty teenager.  
    Just as he reaches the door, Frasier comes out._
    
      **Frasier:** Hi, Dad.
       **Martin:** Oh, Frasier!  You're still home.
      **Frasier:** Yeah.  Where are you going?
       **Martin:** Just out.
      **Frasier:** What are you gonna do?
       **Martin:** Nothing.
      **Frasier:** When are you gonna be home?
       **Martin:** Later.
      **Frasier:** Well, you put a dent in the car, young man, it's coming out 
               of your allowance!
    
    _Martin laughs weakly and leaves.  Frasier picks up a book and a 
    glass of wine from the coffee table and takes them to the kitchen.
    
    Daphne comes in the front door with Charlotte and Maggie -- two fellow 
    domestic servants of British descent -- with shopping bags._
    
    **Charlotte:** I mean, I've got my pride, you know.  So, I said to her, 
               I said, "Mrs. Crease, I'll do the cooking, I'll do the 
               cleaning, but I draw the line at creaming your feet!"
    
    _The two girls drop onto the couch like they own the place._
    
    **Charlotte:** Dear, hurry up!  "The Mambo Kings" is about to start!
       **Daphne:** Oh, I wouldn't mind mamboing with Antonio Banderas!  
               All right, set out the goodies and I'll go get the 
               wine.
    
    _As Daphne heads for the kitchen, Charlotte and Maggie put their feet 
    up on the coffee table.  Charlotte unwraps a large chocolate bar._
    
       **Daphne:** Oh, and this time, Charlotte, be careful with that 
               chocolate!  I had a hell of a time hiding the stain 
               from His Nibs-- [_runs headlong into Frasier_] Oh, hello, 
               Dr. Crane!
    _Charlotte and Maggie hide their goodies and jump to attention.  
    Frasier smiles benevolently, enjoying the power of a man who knows 
    exactly what's going on._
    
      **Frasier:** Daphne.  Charlotte, Maggie.
    **Charlotte/Maggie:** Dr. Crane.
      **Frasier:** Please, sit down. [_they do_]
       **Daphne:** I thought you were filling in at the station tonight.
      **Frasier:** Oh, I am.  But, uh, not for a couple of hours yet.
    _He takes his book and wine to a chair, giving every sign of settling 
    in.  Behind his back, Charlotte and Maggie mime "Get him out of here!" 
    while Daphne mimes back helplessness._
    
       **Daphne:** Oh-ho, seems a shame to hang around here.  I mean, I would 
               have thought you'd have taken an opportunity like this to, 
               I don't know... go down to McGinty's?
    **Charlotte:** Oh, to see his new lady friend, you mean?
      **Frasier:** Ah, well, I see I've been quite the hot topic over the 
               teapot.
       **Daphne:** You know, I may have said a thing or two in passing, but--
    **Charlotte:** I'd go for it, Dr. Crane!
      **Frasier:** Yes, well, if you must know, I was planning to go down 
               there, but not for a couple of days yet.
    **Charlotte:** Well, I wouldn't wait too long.  I mean, strike while the 
               iron's hot, that's what I always say! 
       **Daphne:** She's right.
      **Frasier:** Well, women don't really like men that are too overeager.
       **Daphne:** Oh, nonsense.  I mean, you know, it's one thing if the 
               man's some bounder git from the docks, but it's different 
               if the man's like you.
       **Maggie:** Someone who's charming.
    **Charlotte:** And handsome.
       **Daphne:** And knows lots and lots of words.
      **Frasier:** Well, McGinty's is on my way to the station.  I suppose I 
               could just pop my head in. [_picks up his briefcase and 
               goes to the door_] Thank you, ladies, for your support -- 
               even if it was nakedly self-serving and insincere.
    
    _He smiles at them and leaves.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- McGinty's
    Maureen and Martin are sitting at a table.  Martin's back is to the 
    door._
    
    **Maureen:** So, they finally put my transfer through, and I'm moving out 
             of Traffic and into Narcotics.  Yeah, I'm gonna be working 
             with, uh, Bill Henderson at the 31st.
     **Martin:** Good for you.
    
    _Frasier looks through the window.  Through the crowd, he sees 
    Maureen, but not Martin._
    
    **Maureen:** Yeah, I'm excited, although I hear he can be pretty tough.
    _As Frasier comes in, he notices Martin and wonders what he's doing._
    
     **Martin:** Oh no.  I mean, he might seem a little stiff and strait-laced, 
             but once you get to know him he's the greatest guy in the 
             world.
    
    _Frasier, hearing this, draws the obvious (and wrong) conclusion._
    
    **Maureen:** Yeah, he is pretty impressive.
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, smart, great sense of humor.  No, you're gonna have 
             a great time.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I can't believe you're doing this!
    **Maureen:** Frasier!
     **Martin:** Look, I was gonna tell you--
    **Frasier:**[_to Maureen_] Believe me, I did not put him up to this, 
             though I think he's overselling me a little.  I'm not the 
             greatest guy in the world.  Seattle, maybe.
    **Maureen:** Am I missing something?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm just joking.  OK, Dad, thanks for warming her up 
             for me.  I can take over here.
    **Maureen:** Martin?
     **Martin:** Frasier... Maureen and I are here on a date.
    
    _Frasier absorbs that.  Then he laughs jovially.  Holding up a "one 
    second" finger, he takes Martin's drink and downs it in one gulp, 
    turning his face away as a stormy expression crosses it._
    
    **Frasier:** I know you might think this is one of those wildly 
             embarrassing moments where I'm standing here with egg 
             on my face.  I assure you, I'm not as embarrassed as 
             you might assume I would be embarrassed.  I'm not 
             uncomfortable, so please, don't you be uncomfortable 
             either.
    
    _He takes Maureen's drink and downs it in one gulp._
    
    **Maureen:**[_getting up_] Why don't I give you two a moment?
    **Frasier:** Whatever! 
    
    _Maureen leaves.  Frasier sits down._
    
    **Frasier:** You asked her out?!
     **Martin:** No, that's not the way it happened.
    **Frasier:** There's no use lying to me.  I am at the lowest point I could 
             possibly be, so please just tell me the truth!
     **Martin:** Maureen asked me out.
    **Frasier:** Going down!
     **Martin:** It happened the other night when you went to the bar to get 
             drinks.  You know, it just caught me off guard, I didn't 
             know how to handle it.  So, Niles said I should--
    **Frasier:** Niles?  Niles knows?
     **Martin:** Look, I'm sorry.  It was supposed to be a one-time thing, 
             just to see if there was something there, and if there 
             wasn't, then you didn't even need to know about it.
    **Frasier:** Well, is there?  "Something there?"
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah.
    **Frasier:** Well... it's not as if we were standing side-by-side when 
             she chose you.  I was at the bar!  If you'd gone to get the 
             drinks, things would have been different.
     **Martin:** I don't think so.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I'm drowning here.  Please, throw me a line!
     **Martin:** Look, uh, I'm gonna go tell her this whole thing is a mistake--
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, Dad!  I'll be OK, really.  Well... the old dog's  
             still got it in him, huh?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  But, really, how long can it last?  I mean, she's got 
             to come to her senses eventually--
    **Frasier:** Oh no, Dad, Dad, don't sell yourself short.  You've got a 
             lot to offer.  Well, I'd better head off to work.  
             Goodnight, Dad.
     **Martin:** Goodnight, thanks.
    _Frasier picks up his briefcase and heads to the door.  As Maureen 
    goes back to the table, he can't resist turning back and letting out a:_
    
    **Frasier:** Damn!
    _FADE TO:_
    **DOES THIS MEAN YOU WON'T DO MY TAXES, EDNA?**
    
    _Scene Seven -- KACL
    Roz is talking on the phone in her booth.  A dozen staffers crowd 
    around her._
    
        **Roz:** Uh-uh, OK, thanks. [_hangs up_] Frasier just came in the 
             building, so everybody hide and be quiet.
      **Betty:** Do you think he'll be surprised?
        **Roz:** Considering his birthday was yesterday?  Yeah, I do, 
             Elizabeth.
      **Betty:** Should we yell "surprise" or "happy birthday?"
        **Roz:** We've done this like five hundred times.  And every time it's 
             pretty much the same.  We yell, the person pretends to be 
             surprised, and we stuff ourselves with cake.
      **Betty:** I just wanted it to be perfect.
        **Roz:** And that is what makes you so special to us.  Now get under 
             the console!
    
    _The staffers huddle under the console.  Roz goes into the other 
    booth and opens the door to Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** Hi, Frasier! [_he grunts_] How you doing?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just wonderful.  Forty-three is off to a rousing start.  
             Remember that policewoman I was interested in?
        **Roz:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** Well, she's dating my father!
    
    _The staffers explode with excited whispers._
    
        **Roz:** Your father?
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmm!
        **Roz:** Well, never mind that.  I know just what will take your mind 
             off of it.  I've got something really funny in my booth.
    **Frasier:** I spent the last hour wandering the streets, trying to take 
             assessment of my life.  Do you know how long it's been since 
             I've slept with a woman?  Seven months!
        **Roz:** Frasier--
    **Frasier:** All right, nine months!
    
    _The staffers mouth "Nine months?!" to each other._
    
        **Roz:** I really don't think we should talk about that right now!
    
    _She closes the connecting door, ignoring the protesting motions of 
    the staffers._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh sure, fine, you can't spare me five minutes to talk about 
             my problems, when every day I drop what I'm doing to be your 
             personal Wailing Wall. "Frasier, he stopped calling me."  
             "Frasier, he wants his key back."  "Frasier, his girlfriend 
             is having me followed!"
        **Roz:** I'm sorry.
    
    _She goes back to the connecting door and flings it open._
    
        **Roz:** So nine months, huh?
    **Frasier:** Nine long, long, months.
        **Roz:** Oh...
    **Frasier:** You know who that woman was?
        **Roz:** Who?
    **Frasier:** Edna, from Accounting.
        **Roz:** No...
    **Frasier:** The next day, she dumped me!  I tell you, Roz, I'm starting 
             to feel nostalgic for that summer in my twenties when I was 
             impotent! 
    _Roz walks into her booth, he follows her._
     **Frasier:** The only comfort I have now is knowing that my humiliation 
              can't possibly get any worse!
    **Staffers:**[_jumping up_] SURPRISE!
    _Frasier looks around, realizing the scope of his disclosure - then he 
    notices one female staffer staring at him dourly._
    
    **Frasier:** Hi, Edna.
    _FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier is lying on the couch, having fallen asleep in his clothes.  
    Martin opens the door, sees him, and tries to tiptoe past.  No luck --
    Frasier wakes up, sees Martin, and scolds him for coming home so late.
