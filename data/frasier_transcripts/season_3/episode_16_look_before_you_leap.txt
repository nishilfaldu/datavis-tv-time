    **Skyline:** A helicopter rises above the skyline.
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment - Morning
    Daphne is setting the table for breakfast.  Martin comes out._ 
     **Martin:** Hey, Daphne!  You seen Eddie?
     **Daphne:** No, I haven't.
     **Martin:** It just doesn't feel right to start the day without him 
             licking me awake.
     **Daphne:** Well, don't look at me.
    _Frasier comes in the front door with Eddie._
    **Frasier:** Morning, all.  Daphne, I got treats!
     **Martin:** What the hell are you doing with him?
    **Frasier:** We went for a walk.
     **Martin:** I'm talking to Eddie.
    **Frasier:** When I saw what a beautiful day it was, I headed for the park.  
             Of course, the only people in the park at this hour of the 
             morning without dogs are winos and that guy in the harem pants 
             that washes his hair in the fountain.  He says hello, by the 
             way.
     **Daphne:** It is sort of nice out, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Sort of nice?  My God, haven't you people noticed this?  It's 
             incredible!  Dad, you should feel this.  It's eighty degrees 
             outside and it's the middle of February!  
     **Daphne:** Oh, it is beautiful, and in the middle of such a terrible 
             winter.  Oh, I love nature's little aberrations: warm days in 
             winter, four leaf clovers, Australians...
    **Frasier:** Yes, it is glorious.  It defies you not to take a moment to 
             acknowledge the power that created it.
     **Martin:**[_out the window_] Thank you, global warming!  Hey Frasier, 
             think your guy down at the liquor store could send a bottle 
             of Scotch to my buddy Jimmy in Montana?
    **Frasier:** Sure, Dad.  What's the occasion?
     **Martin:** Today's his sixteenth birthday.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, you'll want to throw in a hooker too, won't you?
     **Martin:** No, don't you get it?  It's February 29th.
    **Frasier:** Hmm.
     **Martin:** It's a leap year.
    **Frasier:** Right.
     **Martin:** He only gets a birthday every four years.
    **Frasier:** I get it, Dad.
     **Martin:** He's really sixty-four.
    **Frasier:** I can do the math.
     **Martin:** Jimmy's having a big shindig tonight.  A lot of guys from the 
             force fly in for it.  Everybody drinks a lot of beer, and then 
             they have a contest to see who's got the biggest scar.  You 
             know, this year I had a real good chance of winning it now 
             that "Shark Bait" O'Reilly's finally died.
    _He takes his coffee to his chair and opens the paper._
     **Daphne:** So, why aren't you going?
    **Frasier:** Yeah Dad, you should go.
     **Martin:** Ah, Montana's too far away.
    **Frasier:** Well Dad, his birthday only comes around once every four 
             years.  As a matter of fact, this day only comes around 
             every four years.  You know, it's like a free day, a gift.  
             We should do something special, be bold!  It's leap year, 
             take a leap!
     **Martin:** You know, I was just about to say the same thing to you.
     **Daphne:** Your son's right.  You shouldn't be afraid to shake up your 
             routine a little bit.
     **Martin:** Hey, I don't see you taking any big leaps today.
     **Daphne:** If there was something I wanted to do, I would do it.
     **Martin:** Well, you're always whining about wanting to change your hair.
     **Daphne:**[_whining_] I don't whine!
    _Martin gets up and goes to the kitchen._
     **Martin:**[_imitating_] "I'm so sick of me hair.  Do you think I should 
             get it cut like Princess Di?  Ooh, do you think that'd make 
             me cheeks look too fat?  That reminds me of the craziest thing 
             me Grammy Moon used to say!"
    
    [_N.B. John Mahoney is an Englishman by birth.  In fact, while Jane 
    Leeves is actually from Essex, in southeast Britain, Mahoney was
    born in the northwest county of Lancashire, adjacent to Daphne's 
    Manchester._]
    
     **Martin:** I'll pay for the damn haircut if you stop yakking and just do 
             it.
     **Daphne:** Yes, well I'll pay for you to go to Montana. [_aside to 
             Frasier_] That's not the one next to New Hampshire, is it?
    **Frasier:** No.  And Dad can pay for his own trip.
     **Daphne:** All right, then.  And I can pay for me own haircut.
    _Martin comes back and sits at the breakfast table._
    **Frasier:** All right, Dad, back in your court.  Are you up to the leap 
             year challenge?
     **Martin:** Ah...
    **Frasier:** Dad, Jimmy's already sixteen.  How many more birthdays is he 
             going to have?
     **Martin:**[_smiles_] You know, I would kind of hate not being there when 
             Jimmy brings out the big ham.  Oh, all right, what the hell, 
             I'll go.  I'll call the airlines after breakfast.
    **Frasier:** That's the spirit!
     **Martin:** Hey, what's your big leap year challenge?
    _The doorbell goes._
    **Frasier:** Well, have you forgotten?  I'm singing "Buttons and Bows" 
             tonight at the P.B.S. pledge drive.
     **Martin:** You sung that same stupid song for the last three years.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but I'm doing something remarkably fresh and different  
             with it this year!
     **Martin:** You're just blowing smoke, aren't you?
    **Frasier:** Like a '56 Rambler!
    _He opens the door to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Good morning, Niles!
      **Niles:** Good?  It's glorious, heaven-sent!  And you know why?  Maris 
             called!  She wants to get together with me this evening.
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, that's wonderful news!  It's high time you and Maris 
             sat down and talked through your problems.
      **Niles:** She doesn't want to talk.  When she says "get together" she 
             means in the "You wear the cr�me fraiche, I'll lick it off" 
             sense.  She's cleared her schedule from seven till seven-
             thirty, that means foreplay AND cuddling!
     **Martin:**[_gets up_] You know, Niles, remember when you were a kid and 
             your mother and I wouldn't discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis 
             in front of you because we knew it'd give you bad dreams?
      **Niles:** Yes.
     **Martin:** It's a two-way street.
    _He exits._
     **Daphne:** Breakfast, Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:** Uh yes, thank you, Daphne.
    _She goes to the kitchen as Frasier and Niles sit at the table._
    **Frasier:** Niles, I don't mind telling you, I'm a little bit concerned 
             about this.  Maris claps her hands, you come running?
      **Niles:** Oh well, don't forget there's a little something for me in 
             this too.  I haven't had sex in six months.
    **Frasier:** Oh, surely you're exaggerating, you've only been separated for 
             three.
      **Niles:** And your point would be?
    **Frasier:** You really want to sacrifice your self-respect for a roll in 
             the hay?
      **Niles:** Substitute a 16th-century giltwood fainting couch for hay and 
             watch me roll!
    **Frasier:** Niles, you and Maris have not sat down and discussed your 
             problems.  As a psychiatrist you know that sex will only cloud 
             the issues.
      **Niles:** You don't realize how desperate I am.  Ever since our 
             separation, I've been paying women to touch me.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles...
      **Niles:** Manicurists, pedicurists, facialists.  Whenever you see a man 
             who's well-groomed, you can bet he's not getting any.
    _He gets up._
    **Frasier:** Well, will you at least think about what I've said?
      **Niles:** I can't.  She's leaving for Europe in the morning, so I have a 
             very small window of opportunity.
    **Frasier:** Niles... you know I'm right.
      **Niles:**[_frustrated_] You just don't want me to have sex because you're 
             not having any!
    **Frasier:**[_shakes a finger at him_] I most certainly am too!
      **Niles:**[_grabs his hand_] Your lips say yes, but your cuticles speak 
             volumes.
    _Frasier, miserable, turns around and sits back at the table, sulkily 
    putting his napkin in his lap._
    **Frasier:** Niles...
      **Niles:** Oh, you're right.  I'll tell her no. [_he sits back down_] It's 
             not going to be easy, though.
    **Frasier:** Of course not.  Just don't think about sex.
     **Daphne:**[_o.s._] Would you like me to butter your buns for you, Dr. 
             Crane?
    _Niles's hand shakes, rattling his coffee cup on the table.  Frasier 
    steadies him._
    **Frasier:** Grandma in a teddy.
      **Niles:**[_thinks, then_] Thank you.
    _FADE OUT_
    **NO, BUT I HEAR OLEG CASSINI 
    TAKES THAT BUS**
    _Scene Two - KACL
    Roz is setting up for the show.  Frasier comes in the door, singing._
    **Frasier:** You're all mine in buttons and bows! [_pushes the door closed 
             with his foot_]
        **Roz:** Oh God, it must be P.B.S. pledge time again.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmm!  Roz, it is a wonderful day.  You know, I think the 
             entire city of Seattle is convinced it's springtime.  I was 
             walking down the street, I passed a pet store, and in the 
             window I could see two snakes doing a mating dance.
        **Roz:** If you ask me, celebrating a dance that brings more snakes 
             into the world is like toasting a law school graduation.
    **Frasier:** Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done nothing to 
             improve your mood.
        **Roz:** Well, how would you feel if you just lost the love of your 
             life?
    **Frasier:** Well, alimony aside, I found it rather liberating.
        **Roz:** My car wouldn't start, so I had to take the bus.  And we're 
             all crowded on there, when suddenly I smell Lagerfeld, and I -- 
             I look up, and there he is.
    **Frasier:** Carl Lagerfeld?
        **Roz:** His name is Gary.  I don't know his last name.  Anyway, we got 
             to talking, and you know, we were really connecting.  I started 
             to believe in kismet.  And all of a sudden, all these people 
             want to get off the bus, and I'm in their way, so I get off to 
             let them out, and before I can get back on, the damn bus 
             drives off -- out of my life, forever.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure another one would have come along in ten minutes or 
             so.
        **Roz:** I'm talking about the guy.
    **Frasier:** So am I.
        **Roz:** You don't get it, Frasier.  I mean, I really felt this guy was 
             the one.
    **Frasier:** Roz, if you really want to try to find him again, you know we 
             do reach half a million listeners.  Why don't you just tell 
             your story on the air?
        **Roz:** On the air?  Oh, I couldn't do that, it would make me look 
             pathetic.  Oh, it's too bizarre, it's too needy.
    **Frasier:**[_looks at the clock_] It's two o'clock.
        **Roz:** Oh my God!
    _She rushes into her booth, closes the door, and cues him._
    **Frasier:** A glorious good afternoon, Seattle.  This is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane.  I'm thinking a lot today about leap year.  Today is 
             February 29th, and although it isn't an official holiday, 
             perhaps it could be looked upon as one in a metaphorical 
             sense.  Just as Christmas reminds us to be generous of spirit, 
             so leap year reminds us to take a leap in our own lives.  To 
             be bold, try something new.  Too often we shrink from doing 
             things we really want to, held back by... oh, appearing 
             foolish, perhaps... Roz?
    _She looks up, surprised._
    **Frasier:** Is there anything you'd like to say before we start taking 
             calls?
        **Roz:** No.
    **Frasier:** I'm reminded of a quotation by John Greenleaf Whittier: "For 
             all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: �It 
             might have been'"... Roz?
        **Roz:** No.
    **Frasier:** Did you know that a woman over the age of thirty has less 
             chance of getting married than of being killed in a terrorist 
             attack?
    _Roz looks alarmed, and grabs the mike._
        **Roz:** This is to Gary.  I was on the Number Seven bus around noon, 
             and you were a stockbroker with a tan briefcase and a cleft 
             chin, and the bus was really crowded and we both reached for 
             the hand strap and our hands touched and we laughed and you 
             said I had a really great laugh and I said you had a really 
             great laugh and we laughed at that...
    _Frasier taps on the glass and signals her to cut to the chase._
        **Roz:** Anyway, uh, you asked me if I were free on Friday, but we got 
             separated before I could give you my phone number, which I 
             would have because I really liked you and I thought you were 
             cute.
    _Suddenly mortified, she claps her hands over her mouth and motions 
    Frasier to take over._
    **Frasier:** So Gary, if you're listening, please, please give us a call.  
             We'll be right back after these words.
    _He goes to commercial._
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, oh my God!  How could I say "I really liked you and 
             I thought you were cute" -- who am I, Marcia Brady?!
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Later
    Frasier and Roz are still on the air.
    _
    **Frasier:** Well, we'll be right back for more calls, and more on the 
             search for Gary, after this news break.
    _He goes to the news.  Niles comes in, excited._
      **Niles:** Good news!  I've figured out a way I can have sex and we can 
             all be happy!
    **Frasier:** As I pause to make sure the "ON AIR" light is off, [_Niles 
             looks at the light, mortified_] continue.
    _Reset to: Hallway
    Niles follows Frasier as he comes out and gets something from the candy
    machine._
      **Niles:** Well, I was driving down the freeway [_glances at a passing 
             woman_] trying hard not to notice the provocative decals 
             truckers have on their mud flaps, when I heard your little 
             speech about breaking out of familiar patterns.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmm.
      **Niles:** Well, sleeping alone has been my pattern!  I'm ready to take a 
             leap!
    **Frasier:** No, you're not.
      **Niles:** Okay, not a leap, but you've got to give me something.  A hop, 
             a bound. [_hopping up and down_] Gimme a jump, oh God-!
    **Frasier:**[_grabs him_] Niles, will you just get a grip!  
    _Reset to: Booth
    Frasier comes back in, Niles follows him._
    **Frasier:** If you thought being with Maris was the right thing to do, 
             you'd be there with her.  You know it's wrong.  That's why 
             you're here, asking for my permission.
    _Roz comes in with some papers._
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier, what if we don't have sex?  What if we just 
             snuggle?
        **Roz:** Whoops, excuse me!
    _She drops the papers and returns to her booth.  Niles follows her._
      **Niles:** Roz... I never noticed what a perky little walk you have.
    _Roz dashes away and drops into her seat, with Niles following and 
    repeating "Roz... Roz..." as Frasier grabs him and pushes him back
    into the other booth._
    **Frasier:** Niles, get back!  You just stop that!  Get control.  My God, 
             man, there are far more important things here than simple 
             immediate physical gratification.
      **Niles:** You're right, I... I just have to martial my self-discipline  
             and... and be strong.
    _Niles leaves the booth and starts to walk down the hallway, past the 
    glass.  A woman passes him, and he turns around to follow her.  As 
    Niles passes the door, Frasier opens it and throws a glass of water at 
    him.  Niles turns back around.
    
    Roz comes in with some more papers as Frasier takes his seat._
        **Roz:** Fifteen seconds.
    **Frasier:** Oh.
        **Roz:**[_looks down the hall_] What is wrong with your brother today?
    **Frasier:** Oh, ignore him.  You know, human nature never ceases to amaze 
             me -- how otherwise rational people can be turned into babbling 
             ninnies by their hormones.
    _A handsome man in a suit has appeared in the glass, holding a bouquet 
    of flowers._
        **Roz:** OH MY GOD!  IT'S GARY!  OH MY GOD!  IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM!
    _She runs out of the booth.  Frasier goes back on the air, watching
    happily as Roz accepts the flowers, then embraces Gary._
    **Frasier:** Well, we're back.  You'll all be glad to know that Cupid's 
             arrow has hit its mark.  Gary has just arrived in the hallway, 
             and has a big bouquet of flowers for Roz.
    _He turns back to the mike._
    **Frasier:** You know, the truth is, I'm really quite delighted with the 
             way things have turned out today.  It inspires me to take a 
             little leap of my own.  As many of you know, this evening, 
             for the third year in a row I will be appearing on the P.B.S. 
             pledge drive...
    _CUT TO: Hallway_
       **Gary:** You know, I was getting a little nervous, the way you were 
             describing me on the air.  
        **Roz:** Why?
       **Gary:** Well, my wife listens to the show.
        **Roz:** You're married?
       **Gary:** Yeah, but it's okay.  I still want to go out with you.
    _Roz starts hitting him with the bouquet.
    
    CUT TO: Booth_
    **Frasier:** So, instead of "Buttons and Bows," I have chosen to sing a 
             very challenging aria from Verdi's _Rigoletto_ - something I 
             have never attempted outside the shower.  I certainly hope my 
             little gamble turns out as well as Roz's has.
    _He turns around and sees Roz attacking Gary.  He turns back round._
    **Frasier:** Or even better.
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Apartment -- Night
    Frasier is playing the notes of the Verdi aria, and singing it -- badly.
    Niles comes out, drying his hair.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh, God!
      **Niles:** Well, perhaps they'll pledge to get you to stop singing.
             Oh, and by the way, thanks so much for the cold shower tip.
    **Frasier:** Did it work?
      **Niles:** No, it did not.  It's clearly an old wives' tail, because I'm 
             still thinking of my old wife's tail.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well I suppose it stood to reason being showered with 
             coldness would only bring Maris more to mind.
      **Niles:** Keep making remarks like that, I won't help you rehearse.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.  It's just that I'm awfully nervous.
      **Niles:**[_pouring sherry_] You know, as much as I admire your willingness 
             to take a leap, I did warn you that you were getting into a 
             dangerous "aria." [_wan chuckles_] Oh God, I'm using humor to 
             mask sexual frustration.  It's high school all over again.
    **Frasier:** Look Niles, I know it's difficult, but Maris has got to learn 
             that you're not just someone who can be ordered to perform at 
             will.  Now sit, play!
    _Niles sits at the piano, and begins playing.  Frasier begins singing, 
    again very off-key.
    
    Suddenly, Martin storms in the front door, throws down his suitcase, 
    and slams the door.  They stop and turn._
     **Martin:** Next time it looks like I'm going to follow a piece of your 
             advice, shoot me in the head first!
    **Frasier:** Dad!  Why aren't you in Montana?
     **Martin:** Fifteen minutes out, a flock of Canadian geese flew into one 
             of our engines.  They were the lucky ones!  
    _He marches into the kitchen.  Frasier and Niles, concerned, follow him.
    
    Reset to the kitchen.
    Martin grabs a beer from the fridge._
     **Martin:** Next thing you know, we're falling five thousand feet. 
             Smokehouse almonds are flying everywhere, people are
             screaming and hugging each other.  The guy in the next 
             seat grabbed hold of my hand, and you know what?  I didn't 
             pull it away!
    _Reset to the Living Room
    Martin comes out, followed by the boys._
     **Martin:** Then our pilot comes out.  Our landing gear's out, we're gonna 
             have to do an emergency belly landing in six feet of foam!  
             So, five hellish minutes later, we're bouncing across the 
             runway.  Then the stewardess comes out and says we're gonna 
             have to go down the emergency slide.  So down I go, headfirst 
             into this sea of foam.  Last thing I remember, this fat lady 
             from across the aisle comes barreling down the chute after me 
             like a polyester avalanche!
    **Frasier:** My God, Dad, I am so sorry.
      **Niles:** So-so, these stewardesses, were they also covered with foam?
    **Frasier:** Will you stop it!  Dad, if you'd like to talk about it, we're 
             both here for you.
     **Martin:** Boy, I tell you, times like this, you just... all you can 
             think of is your loved ones, and how you wish you'd spent 
             more time with them.
    _Beat._
        **All:** Eddie!
    _Martin goes off to his room.  Frasier sits at the dining table._
      **Niles:** Well, let's get back to work.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmm.
      **Niles:**[_checks his watch_] I need something to take my mind off the 
             fact that at this very moment, Maris is slipping out of her 
             frilly under-things and into a non-fat milk bath.
    _He sits at the piano, but notices Frasier's thoughtful look._
      **Niles:** Is something wrong?
    **Frasier:** Yes, something's wrong.  Things turned out so badly for Roz 
             and Dad today, I'm just wondering if my little leap is ill-
             advised.
      **Niles:** Oh, now...
    **Frasier:** Maybe this aria thing won't turn out so well, either.
      **Niles:** Just because theirs went wrong doesn't mean yours will, too.
    **Frasier:** Yeah...
      **Niles:** They're two isolated incidents.
    _Frasier gets up and stands behind Niles._
      **Niles:** All right.
    _He plays the intro to the aria again, and Frasier begins to sing.
    
    Suddenly the door slams again.  They turn and see a tearful Daphne,
    whose hair is flared up in a wildly frizzy crest._
      **Niles:** Oh, will these infernal temptations never end?!
     **Daphne:** Oh, tell me the truth.  Is it as bad as I think it is?
    **Frasier:**[_stalling_] How... bad do you think it is?
     **Daphne:**[_sobbing_] Take a leap!  Mr. Maurice hair-designer!  Trust me!  
             Children pointing!  Your fault!
    _She storms to her room._
      **Niles:** Okay, that's it.  I can't take it anymore, I'm leaving.
    _He gets up and goes to the door._
    **Frasier:** No, Niles!  You can't leave me now, I need you more now than 
             ever.
      **Niles:** Oh, give it up.  No one who's followed your little "take a 
             leap" philosophy has ended up even remotely better.  I don't 
             care what you're saying, I'm going to Maris.  
    _He guns down his sherry, then hurls it into the fireplace with a crash._
    **Frasier:** You will rue the day!
      **Niles:** I don't care!  Niles gotta have it!
    _He leaves, as Frasier sulks.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **HUH?**
    _Scene Five -- TV Studio
    The P.B.S. pledge drive.  There is a phone bank against one wall, where
    several people, including Roz, are taking calls.
    
    Next to a small performing stage is a piano, where Frasier is hovering
    anxiously.  He puts his sheet music down, when his accompanist, Pete,
    arrives.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh, Pete.
       **Pete:** Hi, Doc.  I hear you're doing something new this year. [_sees 
             music_] Whoa!
    **Frasier:**[_hopefully_] What, is it too hard for you?
       **Pete:** Me?  No, I'm-I'm worried about you.  I can hit any note. [_hits 
             high note_] See?
    _Frasier looks extremely worried.
    
    Angle on Roz on the other side of the room:_
        **Roz:** No, Lamb Chop's not here.  Big Bird isn't here either.  What 
             are you doing up so late?  Oh.  Do you have your mommy's 
             credit card handy? [_Frasier comes over_] Have your mommy call 
             us back later, bye-bye.
    _She rises in her seat and smoothes Frasier's tie._
        **Roz:** Well, I guess your little aria must be coming up soon.
    **Frasier:** Yeah - along with some Veal Milanese and a rather disappointing 
             Chardonnay.  Oh, Roz, I hope you're not still angry with me for 
             the way my advice backfired today?
        **Roz:** Oh no, not at all!  In fact, I've been meaning to tell you 
             how much I admire you for what you're doing tonight.  After 
             watching me crash and burn like that, you're going to go out 
             and sing this very difficult song... in a foreign language... 
             under these unflattering lights, with your clothes soaked with 
             sweat, on live television...
    **Frasier:** How long are you going to stay mad at me?
        **Roz:** Until the day I get married.
    _Pete calls from the other side._
       **Pete:** Yo, Doc, Doc! [_Frasier crosses_] Please, please, I've been 
             going over your music, and when we get to this section here, 
             either I can play really loud, or jab you with a pin, because 
             between you and me, you're not hitting this note without a 
             pole vault.
    _The stage manager passes Frasier._
    **Manager:** Ten seconds, Dr. Crane.
    _Frasier stands for a moment in agitation, then..._
    **Frasier:** That's it!  That's it!  I'm not doing the aria!
        **Roz:** What?  You're backing out after you made all of us take those 
             stupid leaps?
    **Frasier:** You bet I am!  It may be an unwise man who doesn't learn from 
             his own mistakes, but it's an absolute idiot that doesn't learn 
             from other people's!
        **Roz:** But you promised all your listeners!
    **Frasier:** Oh, what's the difference?! [_a red light on the camera blinks 
             on_] Who watches P.B.S.?!
    _Seeing the light, he switches to his suave radio voice._
    **Frasier:** I'll tell you who: discerning, cultured viewers, like yourselves.  
             Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  And like yourselves, I care about 
             quality programming, such as foreign films, classical music, 
             opera -- which is why I intended to sing a rather challenging 
             piece: an aria from Verdi's _Rigoletto_.  But, who am I to 
             ignore the dozens of phone calls that have come in requesting my 
             signature piece, a rather charming little ditty that I first sang 
             three years ago on Classic Western Movie Week.  So without 
             further ado, I give you "Buttons and Bows," from _Paleface_.  
             Maestro, please?
    _Pete begins playing._
    
    [_N.B. There are two versions of what Frasier sings printed below: 
    Matthew Barr's, as nearly as I can remember it, and the version
    printed by the closed captioning on the DVD.  I do this to emphasize
    just how wildly unintelligible Frasier's ad-libbing is._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_singing_]
    East is East, and West is West             East is East, and West is West
    And the wrong one I have chose             And the wrong one I have chose
    Let's go where you keep on wearing those-  Let's go where you'll keep on wearing those-
    [_forgetting words_]                         [_forgetting words_] 
    Da da dahs, and boppa dohs,	           Da da dahs, and boppa dohs,
    Things and buttons, buttons and bows!      And things and buttons, buttons and bows!
    _Roz looks up, confused._
    Don't bury me, uh -- lovely pea,            Don't bury me, the something "P",
    Something, la-la-la!                       Something, la-la-la!
    Let's all go to a... taco show, and        Let's all go to a... taco show, and
    and a how I love, such and thrush,         how a, such an impressive, blow my nose,
    blow my nose, 
    You look great in buttons and bows!        You look great in buttons and bows!
    
    I love you in buckskin,                    I love you in buckskin, 
    la da-da da-da daaaa!                      la da-da da-da daaaa!
    _Continuing the song with unintelligible grunting, he turns around, and
    wipes his brow._
    Everybody!                                 Everybody!
    
    My bones denounce, the fearful trounce,    My bones denounce, the fearful trounce,
    and la-la la-la Moldic rose!               and la-la la-la mole that grows!
    Ba-da Seuss, a palm caboose!               Bada souse, a pom capoose!
    and a panda hop, and pantyhose             and a penta hoss, and pantyhose
    You look buppity, buttons and bows!        You'll look buppity, buttons and bows!
    _He blithely takes a bow.  Roz smiles -- she's had her payback.
    
    FADE TO: 
    
    Scene Six - Apartment
    Later that night, Martin and Daphne (with her hair in a towel) are 
    sitting in the living room, watching Frasier's TV performance and 
    killing themselves with laughter.
    _
     **Daphne:** Oh, I bet this is one leap year Dr. Crane won't be sorry to 
             see the back of!
    _Martin bursts out laughing again._
     **Daphne:** Should we rewind it, so we can watch it again?
     **Martin:** No, no, not yet, let it finish first, this is the verse where 
             he REALLY loses it!
    
       **Both:**[_singing_] Bippity-boppity, hippity-dos
             Something and something, and buttons and bows!
    _They finish with a little arm jiggle similar to Frasier's ending, 
    then fall back in their seats, busting their buttons._
     ****Martin:**** Okay, now you can rewind it!
    _Daphne reaches for the remote, but Eddie grabs it and runs off._
     **Martin:** Hey!
    _But Daphne and Martin sit back, very satisfied.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier, wrung out after his humiliation at the telethon, opens the 
    door to Niles.  Niles gives him a comforting hug, then Frasier asks
    Niles if he crumbled and went to have sex with Maris.  Niles assures
    Frasier that he didn't.  Frasier offers Niles sherry.  As he goes to
    the bar, Niles finds a dab of cr�me fraiche behind his ear and 
    hurriedly licks it off.
