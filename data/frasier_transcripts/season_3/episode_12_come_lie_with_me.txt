    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 -- Frasier's Apartment
    Daphne is waking up in her room. She rolls over and we say that Joe 
    has stayed the night._
    
        **Joe:**[_kissing Daphne_] Morning.
     **Daphne:**[_sleepily_] Morning. [_realising_] Morning?  Oh my God, Joe,
             get up!  Get up!  You were supposed to be out of here hours 
             ago. [_quickly putting on her dressing gown_] You promised me 
             that after we did the deed you'd be on your merry way.
        **Joe:** I was.
     **Daphne:** Get dressed.  We've got to get you out of here before Dr. 
             Crane gets up. [_Daphne opens her bedroom door and takes a look 
             outside_] Oh, no.  I smell coffee.  They're already up!
        **Joe:** Now don't worry.  I'll just lay low until the two of them... 
             [_notices the clock_] Oh my God, it's nine o'clock. I'm a half-
             hour late for work.
     **Daphne:** Just give me a minute.  I'll get rid of them.
        **Joe:** Where's my underwear?
    _At this point Eddie comes running into the room and makes a dash for 
    Joe's underwear which is lying on the chair.  He grabs them and runs 
    back out the room with them.  Joe looks a touch dismayed._
    
     **Daphne:** Eddie, get back here!
    _The scene switches to the living room where Frasier is decked out in 
    his squash gear, reading the paper and eating breakfast.  Martin comes 
    through tugging at his trousers._
    
    **Frasier:** Good morning.
     **Martin:** Maybe for you.  I just spent five minutes trying to button 
             these pants.  That stupid dryer shrunk another pair on me.
    _Martin grabs an eclair and stuffs in it his mouth.  Frasier looks on 
    disapprovingly.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dad. Before you blame the dryer, have you ever considered 
             stepping on the old bathroom scales?
     **Martin:** Oh, what's the point?  That thing's been ten pounds off for 
             weeks.
    _In the background, behind Frasier and Martin, Daphne is fighting a 
    "tug-of-war" with Eddie over Joe's underwear.  Frasier and Martin turn 
    round to see what the commotion is._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Oh.  Good morning, Dr. Crane.  Sorry I overslept.  Well, time 
             we all got our day started.  I'll just clear these dishes 
             away. 
    
    _Daphne starts to clear up._
    
     **Martin:** Wait, I wasn't finished with that yet.
     **Daphne:**[_deliberately dropping the eclair into Martin's orange juice_] 
             Whoops.  Sorry about that.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I wasn't quite finished with that toast either.
     **Daphne:** Oh, now, we can't have you running off to your squash game 
             on a full stomach.
    **Frasier:** Yes -- how many championship matches have been marred by the 
             heartbreak of toast cramp?
     **Daphne:**[_to Martin_] Don't you have that Doctor's appointment?
     **Martin:** Yes, but it's not for 20 minutes yet.  What's going on here? 
             Why are you giving us the bum's rush?
     **Daphne:** Bum's rush!  Oh, I just love the American vernacular.  So 
             cute.  So quick.  So long!
     **Martin:**[_heading through to the bedroom with Frasier following_] 
             Better get my wallet first.  Damn pants!  You know -- you spend 
             fifteen dollars on a good pair of pants - you expect them to 
             be shrink resistant.
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, when you pay that kind of money what you're          
             really paying for is the designer name!
    
    _Daphne beckons Joe through who comes rushing out the bedroom, now 
    fully clothed but with his shoes in his hands.  He makes a bolt for 
    the front door._
    
        **Joe:** Gotta go.  I'm so late.
     **Daphne:** Oh hurry, hurry, hurry!
        **Joe:** I'll call you tonight.
     **Daphne:** OK. Bye.
    _They kiss goodbye quickly and separate.  However they look at each 
    other and have a longer kiss.  At this point Frasier and Martin emerge 
    from the bedroom._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh!  Hello Joe.
        **Joe:** Hi Dr. Crane.  I just came by to give Daphne a kiss. 
    
    _Frasier looks suspiciously at him and then looks at the pair of 
    shoes still in Joe's hands._
    
        **Joe:** And drop off these shoes. [_Handing shoes to Daphne_] Here!
     **Daphne:** Oh, thank you.
    **Frasier:** Well.  Can anyone think of anything to make this moment a bit 
             more awkward than it already is?
    _Cue Eddie who runs in and drops Joe's underwear at Frasier's feet._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Eddie!
    _FADE OUT_
    **THEY'RE PLAYING DO-SI-DO, BUT NOT FOR ME**
    
    _Scene 2 -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier and Niles are sitting in cafe Nervosa drinking their coffee 
    whilst watching another couple._
    
      **Niles:** Isn't that Dirk and Gabby Bindercott?
    **Frasier:** Friends of yours?
      **Niles:** Mmm.  Filthy rich.  Timber money.  In their case it really 
             does grow on trees!  Dirk!  Gabby!  Oh, Dirk?
    _Dirk and Gaby are leaving, clearly trying to ignore Niles.  However 
    Niles's calling results in Dirk going to speak to him._
    
       **Dirk:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_introducing_] Dirk Bindercott -- my brother Dr. Frasier Crane.
       **Dirk:** Ah -- I've heard your program. [_checks watch and then the door_]
    **Frasier:** Well -- I've seen your wife.
       **Dirk:** So Niles -- I suppose I'll see you at the benefit on Sunday. 
             I know Maris is coming.
      **Niles:** Yes, Sunday.  Which benefit is Sunday?  I have so many 
             benefits... on Sunday.
       **Dirk:** The ho-down for the homeless.  You were invited?
      **Niles:** The ho-down?  Yippee-kai-yes!
       **Dirk:**[_hears a tooting horn_] Must be Gabby.
      **Niles:** Certainly sounds like her.
       **Dirk:** See you Sunday.
      **Niles:** Yes.  Till Sunday.
    
    _Dirk exits._
    
      **Niles:** I wasn't invited.
    **Frasier:** Niles, it's one party.
      **Niles:** Yes, but when you're off the A-list for one party you're off 
             for all of them.  From now on I'll be relegated to B-list 
             charity events.  Grubby little theatre companies and last 
             year's diseases.
    **Frasier:** This often happens in these cases when two people separate -- 
             their friends choose one spouse over the other.  Surely they 
             chose Maris because she's better connected and has more 
             money than you do.
      **Niles:**[_looking at Frasier thoughtfully_] Exactly which part of that 
             was meant to ease my pain?
    **Frasier:** Niles, I just think you're overreacting.
      **Niles:** Oh wait, wait.  I know what happened.  My invitation just got 
             lost in the mail.  No -- it's not so far fetched.  It could 
             have been missorted... or a stamp could have fallen off... 
             or it could have been stolen by my mail carrier.  Ho-downs are 
             catnip to postal workers!
    
    _Roz comes into the Caf e and joins them._
    
        **Roz:** Well I'd ask you to explain that but then you would!
      **Niles:**[_getting up_] I'm going to check with the post office.  You 
             know -- I heard a story on the news the other day about a man 
             who bought a piano at auction and when he went to tune it he 
             found a 40-year-old unmailed letter under the sounding board.
    **Frasier:** Perhaps we should contact Ferrante & Teicher -- see if 
             they have your invitation?
      **Niles:** Poke fun now.  We'll see who feels foolish this Sunday when 
             I'm sipping champagne atop a mechanical bull!
    
    _Niles exits._
    
        **Roz:**[_to waiter_] Cappuccino, please.
    **Frasier:** Roz, I want to get your take on something.
        **Roz:** What?
    **Frasier:** Well.  Daphne and Joe are having sex in my apartment and it 
             leaves me in a rather awkward position.
        **Roz:** Doing what?  Bending over to look through the keyhole?  
             Oh Frasier, come on, what is the big deal?
    **Frasier:** Well, let's just say that I'm sitting there listening to 
             music, reading a book... and Daphne and Joe are "back there."
        **Roz:** So?
    **Frasier:** Well, it just makes me uncomfortable.  I'm going to ask Daphne 
             not to sleep with Joe in the house anymore.  Is that too...?
        **Roz:** Amish?
    **Frasier:** I was going to say selfish!
        **Roz:** Oh, let's see.  Please Daphne -- don't have sex.  It disturbs 
             my reading!  No, that's not too selfish.
    **Frasier:** Well, I just don't think a man should be uncomfortable in his 
             own home.  How am I supposed to relax when every giggle, 
             every noise makes me... you know...?
        **Roz:** Picture it?
    **Frasier:** Of course not.  Don't be ridiculous.  The very idea.
        **Roz:** You're picturing it right now, aren't you?
    **Frasier:** Well, you made me.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 3 -- Frasier's apartment
    Martin is sitting in his chair reading the paper.  Frasier comes in.
    _
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Hey, Dad.  Is Daphne in?
     **Martin:** Yeah, and if you have any sense you'll pretend that nothing 
             happened this morning.
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes.  Denial.  The sort of advice I'd expect from a man 
             whose driver's license still lists his hair colour as brown. 
             [_going through to Daphne's room._]
     **Martin:** It was until you came back to town!
    
    _Frasier knocks on Daphne's door timidly.  Daphne opens the door 
    looking uneasy._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne.  I think we need to discuss what happened this 
             morning.
     **Daphne:** It's been bothering me all day.  It was entirely my fault.
    **Frasier:** No, no.  I share the blame.  We never did have a formal 
             discussion about the rules of the house, especially when it 
             comes to... you know...
     **Daphne:** I do want to apologise for any embarrassment I may have 
             caused.  You see, we can't go to Joe's because he's still 
             building his house and he sleeps on a friend's couch.  But I 
             can assure you it will never happen again.
    **Frasier:** Well, then our business is concluded.  Meeting adjourned.
     **Daphne:** The next time Joe spends the night, I'll notify you well in 
             advance.
    
    _Daphne closes her door leaving Frasier looking still unhappy. 
    He knocks again on the door and Daphne opens._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne.  I was just reviewing the minutes of our last 
             meeting.  There seems to be some confusion. 
     **Daphne:** Oh?
    **Frasier:** You see, my quibble is not with the lack of notification.  I 
             am just not comfortable with you and Joe sleeping together 
             under my roof.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I see.  I'm sorry about that, but it is my room, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, yes.  And I want you to feel comfortable living here.
     **Daphne:** I suppose it's more important for you to feel comfortable 
             because, as you said, it is your roof.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Thank you for understanding.
     **Daphne:** Not at all.  Joe and I are going away for the weekend but 
             first thing Monday I'm going to start looking for me own 
             place.
    
    _Daphne shuts the door.  As before Frasier realises what she has just 
    said and is still unhappy with this arrangement.  He knocks on the 
    door again._
    
    **Frasier:** Guess who? Daphne... em... I don't want you entertaining here 
             but I also don't want you to move out.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I see.  So you want me to stay, but just not have a 
             personal life?
    **Frasier:** Well...
     **Daphne:** No, no.  That works out fine for me.  I'll just spend all day 
             waiting on you and your father, then in the evenings retire 
             to me room, wrap meself in an Afghan and wait for the morning.  
             And if my whimpering gets too loud for you -- you can just have 
             me fixed like Eddie!
    **Frasier:** That is not what I meant.  This is difficult for both of us, 
             Daphne.  I have to express my feelings.  I also don't want to 
             lose you.  You're very important to me and my father.
     **Daphne:** That's why my solution is best.  I'll still be here during 
             the day to take care of your father but nights and weekends 
             I'll just go home to my own place.  On top of which you can 
             turn this room back into your beautiful study you used to 
             have.
    **Frasier:** Well -- I suppose, what other choice do we have?
     **Daphne:** Of course it'll be a period of adjustment for all of us...
    
    _Whilst she is talking Frasier begins to look round the room and a 
    smile starts to form on his face._
    
     **Daphne:**...I know how much you two care about me and consider me part 
             of the family but... [_notices Frasier's smiling face_] You're 
             picturing your study right now, aren't you?
    **Frasier:**[_sheepishly_] Well, you made me!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 4 -- Frasier's apartment
    Daphne is away for the weekend so it's just Frasier and Martin in 
    the house.  Frasier is in the living room whilst Martin is in the 
    kitchen making breakfast.  The house is looking a bit of a mess with 
    newspapers strewn about the floor.  Eddie is watching everything from 
    the chair._
    
     **Martin:**[_singing_] She's such a groovy lady!
    **Frasier:** Morning, Dad.
     **Martin:** Oh, morning.
    **Frasier:**[_picking up the newspapers and looking around him_] You seen 
             the phone?
     **Martin:** Oh, I probably left it in my room again.  Sorry.  Hey, I'm 
             making breakfast Burritos.  You want one?
    **Frasier:** I'll passo!
     **Martin:** Suit yourself.
    
    _Martin comes out the kitchen carrying his breakfast.  He's wearing 
    nothing but a pair of boxer shorts and a vest.  Frasier frowns at him 
    but Martin just carries on eating his breakfast._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad.  Whatever happened to the silk pajamas I bought you?
     **Martin:** Oh, Frasier, they're too la-dee-da for me.  Besides, they 
             shrank! [_a beep comes from the kitchen_] Whoa -- there go my 
             tater-tots.  You want a pile?
    **Frasier:** Not that I don't enjoy a "pile" of breakfast as much as the 
             next guy but I still think no.  Dad, are you planning on 
             going around like that all weekend?
     **Martin:** Yeah, why not?  Daphne's off on her little trip.  It's just us 
             guys.  Besides I've been wearing pants round here for three 
             years.  Enough!
    **Frasier:** I see.  Look Dad, I just have to do this [_puts an apron on 
             over Martin_]
     **Martin:** All right.  Now, listen.  It's no big deal but I couldn't find 
             the remote control for the TV last night.  Now I thought we 
             agreed that its place was on that table next to my chair.
    **Frasier:** What was it like in the old days when you actually had to 
             get up to change the channel?
     **Martin:** It was hell!
    
    _The doorbell rings and Frasier goes to answer._
    
     **Martin:** You expecting someone?
    **Frasier:** The contractor.  I'm getting an estimate on restoring my 
             study.
     **Martin:** Why don't you use Joe?
    **Frasier:** I think Joe's done enough work in that room, thank you!
    
    _Frasier opens the door to the contractor._
    
    **Frasier:** Henry.  Thank you for coming on such short notice.
      **Henry:** No sweat.
    **Frasier:** I'll just show you the room. [_leads Henry towards Daphne's 
             room passing Martin at the table on the way_] Oh, this is my 
             father. [_to Martin, forcefully_] Don't get up!  Like a cup of 
             coffee?
      **Henry:** That'd be great.
    **Frasier:** Fine.  Look, the room is right down the hall there to the 
             right.  I'll meet you there.
      **Henry:** OK.
    _Henry heads on to Daphne's room.  Frasier goes through to the kitchen 
    before emerging again with a sponge._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad.  This is a small thing but you left the sponge in the 
             sink again.
     **Martin:** So?
    **Frasier:** Well, as I mentioned last evening, if it stays wet, not only 
             does it begin to smell but it becomes a breeding ground for
             bacteria.
     **Martin:** So?
    **Frasier:** So.  If I were to say wipe up that salsa that you spilled on 
             the table just now I would be leaving behind bacteria such 
             as salmonella, lysteria, flagella.  Now wouldn't that bother 
             you?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I guess you're right -- it would bother me.  I wouldn't 
             dream of touching that sponge now!
    
    _Martin whistles in Eddie's direction.  Eddie responds by leaping up 
    on to the chair and licking up the salsa on the table much to 
    Martin's delight and Frasier's derision._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes. Our own foul-breathed little handy wet!
    _End of Act 1
    
    Act 2_
    **HE CRIED WITH HIS BOOTS ON**
    _Scene 1 -- Frasier's apartment_
    _Frasier comes through to the living room to find the television 
    blaring and newspapers strewn all over the couch.  Martin comes 
    through from the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:**[_turning off a light_] You've been leaving lights on in the 
             apartment all weekend.  You know what that does to the 
             electric bill?
    **Frasier:** Suppose there's a nuclear power plant they had to build to 
             keep that television on day and night? 
    _Frasier picks up the remote and switches the television off.  Martin 
    has just settled into his chair._
    
     **Martin:** You moved my chair again, didn't you?
    **Frasier:** No!
     **Martin:** Oh well, maybe Eddie did it.  Eddie, you move my chair?  
             'Cause Frasier said he didn't do it and Frasier never messes 
             around with my stuff.
    **Frasier:** All right, I moved your damn chair.  The way you have it 
             turned ruins the symmetry of the room.  The sight line 
             loses all flow.
     **Martin:** Oh, the sight line.  And here I thought it was for some dumb 
             reason.
    
    _The doorbell rings and Frasier, becoming increasingly exasperated as 
    he goes to answer it, notices Eddie sitting on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Would you get Eddie off of the couch, or else it's down 
             through the garbage chute for the thrill ride of his life!
    
    _Frasier opens the door to reveal Niles wearing a suit and a slightly 
    oversized cowboy hat.  The two do not go!_
    
    **Frasier:** Well, howdy partner.
      **Niles:** Save your snippy remarks.
    **Frasier:** Fair enough.  Say, am I crazy or is there a bright golden haze 
             on the meadow?
      **Niles:** Stop it.  I'm in the middle of a social crisis.  I just drove 
             to the ho-down for the homeless assuming that Maris had simply 
             neglected to forward my invitation.  Well, not only was I not 
             on the guest list but Nelson, the parking attendant, said he 
             missed me at "The Luau for Lupus."  Now it is official.  I'm a 
             social outcast.
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, why do you even care about those people?  In your 
             hour of need they pretend you don't even exist.  They treat 
             you like you're a leper, a non-person.
      **Niles:** But I really, really like them.  I know, I know -- it makes me 
             sound pathetic.  But I'm newly separated.  These people have 
             been my social circle for ten years.  Frasier -- they're my 
             tribe.
    **Frasier:** Well, I hate to break this to you, "Waltzes With Snobs," but 
             they have left you on the mountaintop to die!
     **Martin:**[_coming in from the kitchen_] Now Niles, maybe your friends 
             wanted to invite you but they probably thought you'd be 
             upset seeing Maris there.
      **Niles:** Of course.  You're absolutely right.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's ridiculous.
      **Niles:** Oh, why are you so negative?  These people do care about me.
    **Frasier:** Oh fine, very well.  Why don't you just call them?  Prove to 
             me I'm wrong.
      **Niles:** Nothing would give me greater pleasure.  Where's your phone?
     **Martin:** It's in my bedroom.
    **Frasier:** Where else would it be? [_speaking to Niles as he goes through 
             to Martin's bedroom_] And Dad's electric shaver is in the 
             kitchen.  You see, all our appliances are on an adventure 
             this weekend.
     **Martin:** Well, are you proud of yourself, stirring things up?  Why 
             didn't you just let him think his friends were doing him a 
             favour?
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes.  The Martin Crane approach.  Better living through 
             denial!
     **Martin:** You did the same thing with Daphne.  You couldn't just pretend 
             that nothing was going on back there.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I'm a psychiatrist.  I don't pretend.  I confront.  
             I resolve.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic_] Oh yeah, you really resolved this.  Now she's 
             moving out. You know, I swear you just go looking for trouble.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that is so untrue. 
    _He walks into the kitchen before walking out with the sponge held at 
    arm's length by a pair of tongs._
    **Frasier:** AND PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS!!!
     **Martin:** A grown man's obsession with a sponge?  No, I can't!
    **Frasier:** For the last two days I've asked you again and again as 
             politely as I can to wring out the sponge.  But you don't 
             even have the consideration to respect my feelings.
     **Martin:** Because your feelings are stupid!
    **Frasier:** But they're my feelings!  And important to me!  And because of
             that you should have the courtesy to respect them.
     **Martin:** Just like you respect my feelings when I asked you not to 
             move my chair.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that makes no sense at all.
     **Martin:** Oh, all right. [_gets up out of his chair and takes the sponge 
             out of Frasier's hand and goes through to the kitchen_] You 
             want me to dry that sponge?  I'll dry that sponge! [_Martin 
             puts the sponge into the toaster_] Give it about a minute.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's mature.
     **Martin:** Oh, boy -- you know what a tortured little world you live in? 
             Newspapers strewn all over the place.  Sponge germs coming 
             after you.  It's a wonder you can sleep at night!
    **Frasier:** Oh, my dreams get me by.  Like the one where I strap you in 
             your chair and run around the house turning on all the 
             lights...
    _By now Frasier is running round like a demented madman turning on 
    each and every light in the house._
    
    **Frasier:**...even in the rooms I'm nowhere near.  Boy, that electric 
             meter must really be spinning now!
    
    _Daphne arrives home from her weekend away with Joe._
    
     **Daphne:** Evening, all.  Did you boys have a nice weekend?
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic_] Barrel of laughs!
     **Daphne:** Well, I had the loveliest time. [_notices Eddie on the couch_] 
             Hey -- Off! [_picking up the newspapers on the floor_] We found 
             this little bed-and-breakfast right up the coast. [_moves the 
             remote control to Martin's table_] I talked my decision over 
             with Joe, [_moves Martin's chair back to its original place_] 
             and he agreed it really is the best thing for everyone.  Of 
             course I'll still be here during the day to help your father 
             with his exercises. [_cleans up the table_] But nights and 
             weekends it'll just be you two carefree bachelors getting 
             into trouble together. [_puts one of the lights off before 
             heading into the kitchen_] I'm usually just underfoot around 
             here anyway. [_puts the newspapers in the bin then wrings the 
             sponge out_] So you see, my decision is best for everyone. 
             Well, I've had a long weekend, so good night.
    **Frasier:** Night, Daphne.
    
    _Daphne heads off to her bedroom. Frasier and Martin are quiet, 
    contemplating how Daphne has just sorted everything in one swoop._
    
     **Martin:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** You know how an Oreo has that soft creamy filling between 
             two hard cookies?  That's what keeps them together?
    **Frasier:** See your point, Dad.
     **Martin:** Daphne's kind of the centre.
    **Frasier:** I'll go and talk to her.
     **Martin:** Now, you and me, we'd be the cookie part.
    **Frasier:** I get it!
    
    _Frasier goes through to Daphne's bedroom and knocks on the door. 
    Daphne opens._
    
    **Frasier:** May I come in?
     **Daphne:** Yes, of course.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Daphne.  Daphne... er... you can't go.  You have to 
             stay.  I've only just recently realised how important you are 
             to us.  You see, if you go, Dad and I will kill each other.  
             I'm not just tossing out hyperbole here.  I'm speaking in the 
             most literal sense.  Dad and I -- both dead!  Only he'll be 
             lying there with a bacteria-ridden sponge protruding from
             his mouth like a bloated tongue.  You don't really want that 
             on your conscience, do you?
     **Daphne:** No, of course not.  Truth is, I do still think of this place 
             as my home.  But I know you'd never be comfortable knowing 
             Joe and I were...
    **Frasier:** I'd be willing to try.
     **Daphne:** I know you better than that.  It'll bother you and we'll both 
             be miserable.
    **Frasier:** Why can't I get past this?  Oh, it'd just be easier if I 
             could be like my father pretending you weren't in here 
             making love.
     **Daphne:** Making love?  Is that what you think we were doing?
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.
     **Daphne:** Oh no.  There was nothing like that going on in here.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Seems rather implausible.  I'd like to believe that 
             and believe me I really do want to... er... how can I?
     **Daphne:** Well, how could Joe and I make love?  What with... er... Joe's 
             war injury?
    **Frasier:** I didn't even know Joe was a soldier.  What war would that 
             be?
     **Daphne:** The Falkland Islands.
    **Frasier:** But that was a British conflict and Joe's not...
     **Daphne:** His parents have a summerhouse there!
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's very unfortunate.  Having a summerhouse in a war 
             zone.  But how-?
     **Daphne:** He was kicked by a sheep.
    **Frasier:** A sheep?
     **Daphne:** Yes, a sheep -- spooked by an air raid siren.  Work with me.
    **Frasier:**[_now clearly pretending to believe whatever he is told -- no 
             matter how insane it is_] Oh, I see.  So, what you're saying is 
             that Joe...
     **Daphne:** Can't.
    **Frasier:** Ah.  Well, I suppose that changes everything.
     **Daphne:** Yes, I suppose it does.  But just so as we're clear - even 
             though there's no actual lovemaking, Joe and I can on 
             occasion, say, read poems to each other in here at night?
    **Frasier:** As long as you don't read too loudly.
    
    _Frasier leaves and Daphne looks extremely pleased with herself. 
    Frasier goes back through to the living room to find Martin sitting 
    in his chair reading the paper._
    
    **Frasier:** She's staying.  Turns out they're sleeping together but not 
             having sex. [_Martin looks puzzled_] See, they can't have sex 
             because of an injury Joe suffered when kicked by a spooked 
             sheep during an air raid while his family were vacationing 
             in the Falkland Islands during the war.
    _Martin just nods his head in agreement.  Niles walks through from the 
    bedroom._
    
      **Niles:** Well, Dad was right.  They are my real friends.  It was all 
             just a misunderstanding.  Apparently the social chairman's 
             dog ate my invitation.  And the poor animal had to go to the 
             vet and with all the confusion they forgot to send me 
             another, and when I offered my new address for next year's 
             party, they said, "no need -- we'll see you around."
     **Martin:**[_joining into the spirit of the now-blatant lying as he tugs 
             at his trousers_] I'm going to start wearing sweat pants. 
             That damned drier again.  Hey, you guys want some cookies? 
             They're reduced fat.
    **Frasier:** Really?  That means we can eat twice as many. 
    _The boys all continue to talk to each other -- quite happy in their own
    worlds of make-believe.
    
    End of Act 2_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne is in the kitchen pouring orange juice in the morning.  Frasier 
    and Martin are standing in the background.  Daphne pours three glasses 
    but then walks past them both and heads towards her bedroom, carrying
    all three.  Martin and Frasier look extremely concerned and go to 
    follow her.  However Daphne comes back round the corner laughing at 
    them and hands them a glass each._
