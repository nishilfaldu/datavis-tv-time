    _Act One_
    
    _Scene One - KACL
    Frasier's show is on the air, but Frasier is nowhere to be seen. 
    A nervous Roz is filling in._
    
        **Roz:** Well, it's uh... 2:07, here on the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.  
             As I said, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer, [_looks to see 
             if Frasier is coming_] filling in for the temporarily detained 
             Dr. Crane. [_picks up a copy_] It's cloudy and 62 degrees outside 
             coming up on 2:08... [_looks at clock_] right... there.  Well, 
             let's take a call.  Hello, Lydia.  What seems to be the 
             problem?
      **Lydia:**[_v.o._] I already told you.
        **Roz:** Yeah, that was when I was the call screener, now I'm the host. 
             So, tell me your problem, and take your time.
      **Lydia:** Well, it started about two weeks ago.  I got this terrible 
             obscene phone call.  It's happened several times since then 
             and now it's to the point where I'm afraid to answer my own 
             phone. 
    
    _Roz notices Frasier running by the window._
    
        **Roz:** Well, obscene phone calls can be very disturbing. [_Frasier 
             bursts in_] But luckily, Dr. Frasier Crane has just arrived and 
             I'm sure he knows exactly what soothing things to say. 
    
    _Roz hands the headphones to Frasier.  He is out of breath from 
    running and can only pant into the microphone, causing Lydia to 
    scream in fear and hang up._
    
        **Roz:**[_into microphone_] Maybe now would be a good time to take a 
             break.  We'll be right back after this. [_pushes in a cart_]
    **Frasier:** What the hell was that all about?!
        **Roz:** Oh, never mind that, where were you? 
    **Frasier:** Oh, god.  Somebody'd parked in my space again.  I had to park 
             six blocks from here and sprint the whole way.  By the end, 
             my tweed pants were throwing off so many sparks I almost 
             caught myself on fire!  I tell you what - the minute we go 
             to a news break I'm going to rush down there and put this 
             withering note on his windshield. [_writing_] "Dear discourteous 
             driver..."
        **Roz:** Whoa!  I think you've said enough right there! [_snatches his 
             note_] Come on, Frasier.  This isn't gonna do any good!  You 
             want to make an impression on him?  Get tough.  You go right 
             down there and let the air out of his tires.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I wouldn't do something like that.
        **Roz:** Why?  It's just inconveniencing him like he inconvenienced 
             you.
    **Frasier:** Roz, listen, the world has become uncivilized enough without 
             me stooping to that level.  Of course I was sorely tempted 
             last night.  I went to the movies to see "How Green Was My 
             Valley."  Lady Luck seated me in front of two elderly women 
             who said with the arrival of each new actor, "My God, doesn't 
             he look young; he's dead, you know."  Finally I had to just 
             walk out.
        **Roz:** Oh, you're on in five seconds.  And Brenda is on line one. 
             [_enters her booth_]
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Hello, Seattle.  We're back, and I would like to 
             start by apologizing for being tardy.  Nothing quite so 
             inconsiderate as making someone wait.  Now without further 
             ado let's get to Brenda.  Hello, Brenda.
     **Brenda:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane. I'm having a problem with my sister. 
             She's always... [_her phone clicks_] Oh, wait a second.  That's 
             my other line. [_clicks over_]
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] Something tells me I'm going to be siding with 
             Brenda's sister.
    _FADE OUT_
    **A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR ALL
    YOU DONALD CRISP FANS**
    
    _Scene Two - A video rental shop
    Frasier enters the shop and holds the door open for an outgoing 
    customer. She doesn't say a word._
    
    **Frasier:** You're welcome! [_walks up to the counter_] Excuse me, I was 
             wondering if you could direct me to...
    _The phone rings; the clerk ignores Frasier and answers the phone._
    
      **Clerk:** Friendly Video.  Yeah, I think we got that one.  Hang on a 
             second, I'll check.
    **Frasier:**[_to a customer behind him_] Don't you hate that?  You come all 
             the way down here yourself to the store, wait patiently, and 
             somebody who calls in from home gets preferential treatment.
    
    _A second clerk opens up another line._
    
      **Clerk:** I can help the next person in line.
    
    _The other customers rush to the next lane ahead of Frasier._
    
      **Clerk:** Hey, do we have "The Invisible Man?"
    **Frasier:** Right here!
      **Clerk:** Thanks. [_in phone_] Yeah, we got it. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Excuse me. I was looking for... [_the phone rings again; the 
             clerk reaches for the phone, but Frasier places his hand on 
             top of it_] Don't even think about it!  I'm looking for "How 
             Green Was My Valley."
      **Clerk:** Huh?
    **Frasier:** It is a beautifully acted depiction of life in a small town 
             in Wales.  It won five Academy Awards!  It's a classic!
      **Clerk:** Oh. Well, uh, this is a shot in the dark, but you might try 
             looking in the Classics section.
    
    _Frasier rolls his eyes and heads toward the Classics section, only 
    to find a woman who had been behind him in line picking up the same 
    video._
    
    **Frasier:** Uh... you're taking "How Green Was My Valley?"
      **Woman:** I heard it was great.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but you heard it from me!  You were standing next to me 
             in the line! [_she says nothing and takes her place in line; 
             Frasier, frustrated, goes back to the clerk_] Excuse me, is 
             there another copy?
      **Clerk:** Oh yeah, that would be across the street in our "How Green 
             Was My Valley" annex.
    
    _Frasier stalks out of the store in annoyance.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's apartment
    Martin is in his chair watching television. Daphne enters with a 
    basket of laundry._
    
     **Martin:**[_chuckling_] Hey Daphne. Come on, you're just in time.  It's 
             starting.
     **Daphne:** I don't get this show.  People send in videos of themselves 
             having the most embarrassing and painful accidents.  They add 
             cartoon noises and music and everyone laughs themselves silly.
     **Martin:**[_laughing at the TV show_] Boy, I bet that hurt!
    _Daphne shakes her head and exits to her bedroom as Frasier storms in._
     **Martin:** Well, what's wrong with you?
    **Frasier:** Frankly, I have had it with the whole boorish, ill-mannered 
             world.  Look, Dad, would you mind terribly if I used the TV 
             tonight?  I went to three video stores to get this tape.  I'm 
             just dying to see it. 
     **Martin:** Sure, go ahead.  How many times can you watch a dog get hit 
             with a swinging door?
    **Frasier:**[_staring at Eddie_] Depends upon the dog.
    
    _Eddie jumps down from the couch and follows Martin into the kitchen. 
    Frasier walks over to put the tape in just as loud, piercing rock 
    music begins playing from upstairs._
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell is that?!  The windows are rattling, the walls 
             are shaking, and I am talking to no one!!
     **Daphne:**[_entering_] Well, I see our neighbor's at it again. 
    **Frasier:**[_grabs the phone_] Not for long!
     **Martin:**[_entering_] I'm gonna take a nap.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you can't possibly expect to sleep in this racket.
     **Martin:** Are you kidding?  I've slept through worse than this.  In 
             Korea I dropped off in a foxhole right outside P'Anmunjom. 
             By the time I woke up the cease-fire was over and I was the 
             only one who didn't know about it.  Talk about having egg on 
             your face. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:**[_in phone_] Yes.  Yes, would you please connect me with the 
             young man who's just moved into the penthouse upstairs.  No, 
             I don't know his name!  He's in the penthouse!  He has shaggy 
             hair, tattoos all over him, his body is pierced.  Oh, and I 
             don't know if I mentioned this but he's in the penthouse! 
    _The music stops suddenly.  Frasier and Daphne look up at the ceiling._
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Never mind. [_hangs up; to Daphne_] Has the world 
             completely lost the concept of common courtesy?  Am I the only 
             one who is resisting this tide?! [_walks out onto the balcony 
             and bellows:_] People of Seattle, listen to me!  We are not 
             barbarians!  We are not Neanderthals and we are not French!  
             Do you hear that, you up there?! [_walks back in and gets a 
             glass of sherry_]
     **Daphne:** That's his own music he's listening to, you know.  His name 
             is Freddie Chainsaw.
    **Frasier:** Chainsaw?  Of the Newport Chainsaws?  How does an arrested 
             adolescent who barely knows two chords get a penthouse?
     **Daphne:** His last album sold five million copies.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Well, then, I'll just add that to my list of reasons to 
             die. 
     **Daphne:** You know, personally, I like it.  But then, we Brits have 
             always been on the cutting edge.  You should have heard the 
             punk rockers who rented the flat below me a few years back. 
             They'd play the same song over and over again: [_singing_] 
             Flesh is burning... nana nana nana.  Flesh is burning... nana 
             nana nana. [_sighs_] Oh no.  I'm gonna have that tune in me 
             head all day now.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, thank you for that, Daphne.  But I've been waiting 
             all day to watch my movie.
    
    _He pushes play on the remote control.  The movie begins, but is 
    suddenly undercut by Mr. Chainsaw's loud music again.  Frasier angrily 
    jumps to his feet._
    
    **Frasier:** Doesn't he ever stop for sex and drugs?! [_he grabs for the 
             phone again and dials the operator_] Hello.  Yes.  Please, I 
             insist on being connected with the young man in the 
             penthouse. [_the music stops as Mr. Chainsaw answers his 
             phone_] Yes, hello, Mr. Chainsaw?  Yes, how do you do?  I'm Dr. 
             Frasier Crane.  I am your neighbor; I live right below you. 
             Yes, do you have any idea how loud your music is?  Oh.  You 
             do?  Well... thank you. [_he hangs up the phone, pleasantly 
             surprised_] Well, that wasn't so bad.  The young man seemed 
             quite amiable in his way. 
    
    _The peace is short-lived however, as the music starts up again. 
    Frasier has had enough._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm going out!
     **Daphne:** What?
    **Frasier:** I'm going out!
     **Daphne:** What?
    **Frasier:**[_just as the music stops_] I AM GOING OUT!
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] Hey, Frasier, will you keep it down out there.  I'm 
             trying to take a nap!
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE ETIQUETTE LESSON**
    
    _Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    The cafe is crowded and no tables are available.  Frasier and Niles 
    are standing at the counter._
    
    **Frasier:** Smell me, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_sniffs_] Grandpa!
    **Frasier:** Exactly!  On my way down in the elevator today a woman thinks 
             nothing of lighting up a cigarette.  Has the world gone mad?
      **Niles:** I know exactly how you feel.  This morning I discovered a 
             ding in the door of my car.
    **Frasier:** Let me guess - no note on the windshield?
      **Niles:** No.  And even worse, after I'd left the car off at the body 
             shop, the rental agency didn't have a single luxury car 
             left.  They stuck me with some vehicle I believe they call a 
             Hunchback.
    **Frasier:** No.  I think that would be a Hatchback, Niles.
      **Niles:** It's painted panic-button red, with a large rear window that 
             pops open.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that would be the Hatchback.
      **Niles:** Well, there's a novel idea: name the car after its most 
             hideous feature.  I presume it was a toss-up between 
             "Hatchback" and "What's that odor coming from the floor?" 
    **Frasier:**[_points_] Oh, look, Niles - free table!  Go, go, go, go! 
      **Niles:** Oh, the biscotti!
    **Frasier:** Leave it!
      **Niles:** Oh, no - go on without me!
    _Frasier reaches the table just as a couple sits down at it.  He spots 
    another empty one in the back._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, there!
      **Niles:** Oh!
    _They maneuver their way through a crowd of customers just in time to 
    see that that table has already been taken as well._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, check on table one!
    **Frasier:** All right, fine.
    _They reach the table, but the couple hasn't left yet.  Frasier and 
    Niles stand awkwardly above them, waiting for them to leave._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, we're not hovering, believe me.  It's just that there... 
             well, there's really no place else to stand.  Oh, just take 
             your time, please.  There's no rush. 
     **Waiter:** Is the owner of a red Hatchback here?  It's about to be towed.
    **Frasier:** Niles, isn't that your car?
      **Niles:**[_whispering_] Shh!  Someone will hear you!
    **Frasier:** Niles, it's about to be towed!
      **Niles:** I'm not owning up to that car.  I don't care if it's careening 
             toward a baby carriage!
    
    _The couple leaves the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh, thank you so much.  Take care, have a lovely day.
    
    _As Frasier says this, a man sneaks in behind him and sits down at 
    the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, but we were waiting for this table.
        **Man:** So get another one.
    **Frasier:**[_irritated_] Well, there aren't any.  Look, you knew that we 
             were waiting for it.  We politely stood back and let those 
             people leave and then you just jumped right in here!
        **Man:** Well, you won't make that mistake again.
    
    _Frasier's eyes bug out._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier... forget it.  We'll just... we'll wait for 
             another table.
    **Frasier:** No, we won't!  This isn't about the table anymore!  This is 
             about the erosion of common decency. [_places his coffee on 
             the table_] Sir, when you treat me this way you encourage me 
             to be discourteous to another.  And so on and so on. [_the man 
             doesn't acknowledge him_] You don't have any manners, do you? 
             [_the man continues sipping his coffee_] Then perhaps what you 
             need is an etiquette lesson!!
    
    _Frasier lifts the man up from his chair and roughly shoves him out 
    the door.  He returns to find all eyes upon him in shock._
    
    **Frasier:** SIT DOWN, NILES! [_they sit_]
      **Niles:**[_to a waiter_] My brother will have a decaf. 
    
    _Niles moves Frasier's coffee away from reach.
    
    End of Act One
    
    Act Two
    
    Scene One - Frasier's apartment
    The next morning. Daphne enters with a basket of laundry, singing to 
    herself._
    
     **Daphne:** Flesh is burning, nana nana nana...
     **Martin:**[_entering from the kitchen and singing to himself_] Nana nana 
             nana... flesh is burning... nana nana nana... [_sees Frasier 
             enter_] Oh, hi, Fras.  How you feeling?
    **Frasier:**[_sits at table_] Fine.
     **Martin:** I didn't ask you yesterday how your day went.
    **Frasier:** What did Niles tell you?
     **Martin:** Nothing!  Geez, can't I ask you how your day went?  How was 
             work? [_grins_] How's your bad-ass self? [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Dammit!  Niles blabbed!
     **Martin:** No, he didn't.  You made the people of Seattle column. 
             [_presents a paper_] Right here, under "The Crane Mutiny." 
             [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:**[_reads_] "Three cheers for Dr. Frasier Crane, who struck a 
             blow against rudeness yesterday in a coffeehouse melee." 
             [_throws paper down_] Perfect!  Now all of Seattle knows about 
             my loutish behavior! 
     **Martin:** What are you talking about?  This guy had it coming. [_doorbell 
             rings_] I can just picture it.  He probably looked at you and 
             he thought, "This guy's a creampuff, you know.  A wuss... 
             a wimp... a cupcake..."
    **Frasier:**[_as he reaches the door_] Dad!
     **Martin:** I'm sorry, I'm just so proud of you!
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Ah, there he is, the man who floats like a lepidoptera and 
             stings like a hymenoptera.
     **Martin:** Niles, I think you're just jealous.
      **Niles:** Jealous?  Don't be ridiculous!
     **Martin:** This is my favorite part. [_reading_] "With one swift move the 
             good doctor hoisted the miscreant out on his ear, declaring, 
             'What you need is an etiquette lesson.'" [_laughs_] I love that!  
             You got your own tough-guy catchphrase!
      **Niles:** It's perfect for you, Frasier.  Dirty Harry meets Emily Post.
     **Martin:** Come on.  Show me how you grabbed him.  Use Niles.
    **Frasier:** No, no Dad.  I will not toss Niles about the room.
      **Niles:** Oh no, go ahead.  Rough me up, Mr. Big Hero Bully Bouncer! 
             [_pause_] Did that sound jealous?
    **Frasier:** A tad.
      **Niles:** Well, all right, I'm jealous.  Why shouldn't I be?  All my 
             life I've backed out of fights and watching you leap into the 
             fray like that, I... it made me think just once I'd like to 
             experience what you felt - go nose to nose. [_sits at table_]
     **Martin:** Oh, your day will come, son.
      **Niles:** I don't know.  I tried it this morning with my dry cleaner, 
             Mr. Kim.  I decided to give him a good tongue-lashing because 
             he'd shattered the mother-of-pearl buttons on my best 
             waistcoat.  Unfortunately, due to his tenuous grasp of 
             English and the fact that his mother's name _is_ Pearl I was 
             forced to flee his establishment amid a shower of coat 
             hangers. 
     **Daphne:**[_entering from her room; to Niles_] Good morning, Dr. Crane. 
             [_to Frasier_] And to you, Dr. Crane, our very own knight in 
             shining armor...
      **Niles:** Oh, great.
     **Daphne:** I want you to know that your assertiveness inspired me.  For 
             weeks now, some louse has been removing my wet clothes from 
             the washer and leaving them on the table in a soggy mess. 
             This morning, I decided to get my revenge.  So I took off my 
             new red panties and I popped them in with his whites.
      **Niles:** Bravo, Daphne.  Good for you.  God, I wish I'd been there. 
             [_sighs_]
    **Frasier:** Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit?
     **Daphne:** Absolutely not.  Those were my panties and I wasn't afraid to 
             use them. [_Niles bites down on his fist_]
     **Martin:** Fras, why do you keep backing away from this?  I mean, you 
             should be proud of yourself.  We all think you did the right 
             thing.  The newspaper does too.
     **Daphne:** That's right.  And I'm going to fix you a proper hero's 
             breakfast. [_starts for kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** No.  No, no... Daphne.  Please, really.  It's not necessary. 
             Thank you all.  It's just that this isn't sitting well with 
             me.  I find it hard to believe any good can come of violence. 
    
    _The loud rock music starts up again. Frasier angrily throws down his 
    napkin and grabs the phone._
    
    **Frasier:** That's it again! [_in phone_] Mr. Chainsaw.  This is Dr. 
             Frasier Crane...
    _The music stops abruptly. Frasier and the others look up at the 
    ceiling with amazement.  Frasier hangs up the phone with an air 
    of bravado._
    
    **Frasier:** Go ahead, Daphne.  Make my eggs.

    Scene Two - KACL
    Frasier walks down the hall on the way to work.  He encounters several 
    coworkers who give him a thumbs up or a voice of approval.  A few back 
    away in mock fear.  He chuckles and waves them off._
    
    **Frasier:**[_as he enters his booth_] You know, I do wish people would 
             stop making such a fuss. 
        **Roz:** They will, if you quit walking up and down the hall.  You're 
             on in five seconds. [_enters her booth_]
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, all right. [_puts on headphones and pushes on air 
             button_] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Who's on the line, 
             Roz?
        **Roz:** We have Mitch on line three.  He's having trouble with his 
             neighbors.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Mitch.
      **Mitch:**[_v.o._] Make that _had_ trouble. This idiot next door had his 
             leaf-blower going at 7:00am, again.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's very inconsiderate.
      **Mitch:** I'll say.  That's why I decided to give him an "etiquette 
             lesson."  I grabbed that leaf-blower and smashed it against a
             tree.
    **Frasier:**[_gasps_] Mitch, I must say I'm stunned.  I can't imagine a
             more extreme response to such a minor infraction.
    
    _DISSOLVE TO: another caller.  Frasier's jacket is off and he is 
    slumped over the desk._
    
       **Chris:**[_v.o._] ...so I snuck into his backyard and shoved a whole 
              pound of rotten shrimp into his air conditioner!  Come on 
              summer!
    _DISSOLVE: another caller goes on... Frasier's sleeves are now rolled 
    up. He listens, horrified._
    
       **Chuck:**[_v.o_] ...hey, he asked for it.  So I put 100 scorpions in a 
              FedEx package.
     **Frasier:** Look, I'm sorry, but no matter how provoked you may have 
              been, there is no earthly justification for... [_dissolve_] 
              SETTING SOMEONE'S LAWN ON FIRE!!
    **Rochelle:**[_v.o._] But she doesn't curb her dogs!
     **Frasier:** Oh... [_buries his face in his hand_]
    **Rochelle:** You don't take any guff.  Why should I?
     **Frasier:** Rochelle... all of you... look, don't you realize that your 
              behavior is just a bit extreme?!  I displayed a minor bit of 
              force in order to just make a point.  I didn't go around 
              smashing windows or torching lawns!  Where does it end?
    **Rochelle:** Are you saying that what I did was wrong?
     **Frasier:** Of course I am!
    **Rochelle:** But what you did was okay?
     **Frasier:** No, no!  I... come to think of it, what I did was just as 
              wrong.  I mean, who am I to draw the line at the acceptable 
              level of force?  Because the next person moves a little 
              farther, and the next person, a little farther still until 
              we finally end up with scorpions flying through the mail 
              like Christmas bundt cakes!  What we must all agree to do is 
              to resolve our differences with discussion and reason.  As a 
              matter of fact, I'm going to call the gentleman that I 
              manhandled and... and apologize to him for not having worked 
              out our dispute in the right way in the first place-
              through words.  The key here is restraint.  And I do hope
              you'll follow my lead... Becky with the nail gun. 
    _FADE TO:_
    **NO ACTORS WERE HURT DURING
    THE FILMING OF THIS SCENE**
    
    _Scene Three -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier and Niles enter the cafe. The customers applaud as they see 
    Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh... people.  People, please.  There's no need for that.  I'm 
             no hero.
    
    _A woman walks by and gives him a thumbs up.  He chuckles and returns 
    the gesture._
    
      **Niles:** No one's ever given me the thumbs up.
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you.  The rest 
             of the hand has been well-represented. [_They sit just as the 
             man Frasier shoved walks in the door._] Oh, look, there he 
             is.  Mr. Harvey, I'm so glad you could come. [_stands_] You 
             remember my brother, Niles, and uh... we're at "our" table.
     **Harvey:** Look, I'm here, so say what's on your mind.
    **Frasier:** Well, there's no need for any hostility.  I just came to 
             talk.
     **Harvey:** Talk?  You're not gonna take another shot at me?
    **Frasier:** No! [_shouts of contention from the crowd of customers_] No, 
             they'll be nothing like that here today!  Now, listen, I 
             could try to explain my behavior by saying that these are 
             stressful times we live in, that I had reached the end of my 
             tether.  But I won't do that, because you see, I was 100% 
             wrong.  I had absolutely no right to touch you and I accept 
             full responsibility. 
     **Harvey:** Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. [_to crowd_] And I hope 
             you all heard that too.
    **Frasier:** So, then you accept my apology?
     **Harvey:** No, I'm suing you.  And I've got a lot of witnesses that just 
             heard you admit you were wrong. [_hands him papers_]
    **Frasier:** But, but... these are stressful times we live in and I'd 
             reached the end of my tether!
     **Harvey:** Tough!  I'm nailing you for assault!
    **Frasier:** But I hardly touched you!
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier, I'm not surprised he's hiding behind lawyers. 
             What other behavior would you expect... from a chicken?
     **Harvey:** What did you say?
      **Niles:** I was speaking to my brother. [_stands_] But, to put it in 
             language you can understand... [_clucking_] bawk bawk bawk 
             bawk!
    **Frasier:** Niles!  This is no time for you to assert yourself!
     **Harvey:**[_to Frasier_] Hey, your brother's making trouble here...
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh... what are you gonna do?  Flap me with one of your 
             big fluffy wings?
    **Frasier:** Niles, stop it!  Please excuse him!
      **Niles:** Oh, for god's sake, Frasier don't waste your breath on this 
             hairy, knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing troglodyte who's 
             probably the only male in existence who suffers from penis 
             envy! [_excitedly hops up and down on his heels_]
     **Harvey:** You look here, buddy...
    _Words cannot do this justice - you have to see it. Mr. Harvey lightly 
    pokes Niles on the shoulder.  Niles acts as if he were punched.  He 
    begins reeling backward - laying waste to chairs and the coat hanger -
    finally landing atop a table and sending it and he crashing to the 
    floor.  The entire caf e gapes at the scene as Frasier rushes to his 
    aid._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!!  Niles... are you all right?!
      **Niles:**[_pulling Frasier close to him and whispering_] Counter suit!
    **Frasier:**[_jumping up_] Oh, my god!!  Nobody move him!
     **Harvey:** I barely touched him!
    **Frasier:** Then you admit you touched him! [_to crowd_] He admits it! 
             [_Niles groans_] Oh, Niles.  Niles, I'm here for you.  I promise 
             we're going to get you the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY 
             CAN BUY! [_out of earshot_] My god, Niles, that was brilliant. 
             You even got a tear in your eye!
      **Niles:** I landed on a fork.
    
    _End of Act Two_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne is in the elevator with a basket of laundry. The doors open 
    and two men get on and stand behind Daphne. They both have tennis 
    rackets and outfits, but while one man's outfit is white, the other 
    man's is a light pink. Daphne tries to suppress a laugh as she looks 
    back at the man in pink. The men soon get off on their floor. When 
    the doors close, Daphne whips out her red panties from her basket and 
    flings them high in the air. She then "blows" them out--as if they 
    were a smoking gun. She finally puts them back in her basket with a 
    satisfied grin.
