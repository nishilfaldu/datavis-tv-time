    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - KACL.
    Frasier is approaching his last caller of the day._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, we have time for one more caller.  Roz?
        **Roz:** We have Ed on line three.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Ed, I'm listening. [_no answer_] Ed? [_no answer_] Ed? 
             Well, we seem to have lost Ed.  Let's take another caller.  
             On line four we have.... Roz?
    _Roz has begun eating and cannot talk because she has a mouth full._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz? 
    
    _Roz takes some milk but she still cannot eat it quickly enough._
    
    **Frasier:** We have....
    
    _Roz decides to mime.  So she points to her eye._
    
    **Frasier:** Eye...
    
    _Roz leans to the left._
    
    **Frasier:** Lean. [_then:_] Oh, Eileen.  Hello Eileen, I'm listening.
     **Eileen:**[_v.o:_] Dr. Crane, I've been very happily married for twenty 
             years and I wouldn't dream of cheating, but lately when we're 
             making love I find myself fantasizing about people... other 
             than my husband.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's perfectly normal.  It's quite normal to spice up 
             one's love life by imagining a tryst with, oh, a sports figure 
             or a movie star or...
     **Eileen:** Or a radio psychiatrist?
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?
     **Eileen:** It's your voice, Dr. Crane.  You must have the most sensuous 
             voice on earth.
    **Frasier:**[_putting on a sensuous voice:_] Oh, I don't know, Eileen.
     **Eileen:** I've never seen your picture.  Would you mind describing 
             yourself?
    **Frasier:** Oh, well I don't really think that's appropriate...
        **Roz:** I'll do it. 
    **Frasier:** Roz, I don't think...
        **Roz:** He's about six-one, with a granite jaw and the broad shoulders 
             of a marine.  He's been wearing his hair short lately but that 
             only accentuates his cobalt blue eyes, his chiseled cheekbones 
             and his full, provocative lips.
     **Eileen:** Wow!  Thanks Roz, and thank you, Dr. Crane.  I'll be thinking 
             of you tonight - with any luck, twice! [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane feeling a little red in his 
             chiseled cheeks.  Till tomorrow then, this is KACL 780 AM. 
             [_signs off air_]
    _As Frasier presses a button Roz enters his booth and goes to the tape 
    deck._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, that was quite a flattering description.  You know, 
             just out of curiosity: were you just helping that lady with 
             her fantasy or do you really see me that way?
        **Roz:**[_freezes, then in a haunted voice:_] You really don't know, 
             do you? [_turns around_] Frasier, I am so attracted to you, 
             I always have been. [_starts to get closer to him_] Your looks, 
             your voice...
    
    _She begins to straddle him and bend him backwards in his chair._
    
        **Roz:** You don't know how many times I've wanted to strip naked and 
             hurl myself at that glass partition like a bug on a 
             windshield.
    **Frasier:** Are you through?
        **Roz:**[_smacks his head_] Well, ask a stupid question!
    _She gets off of him and goes back to the tape deck as Frasier sorts 
    his briefcase out._
    
    **Frasier:** All right Roz, I will see you tomorrow.
        **Roz:** Hey, aren't you going to the staff meeting?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, just tell them that my aunt died.  I'm off to 
             her lawyer's now, she put me in charge of her memorial.
        **Roz:** Oh, I'm so sorry.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't be, she was a dreadful old harpy.  Life around her 
             was miserable.
        **Roz:** That should look nice on her headstone.
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't mean any disrespect but you know, the entire
             time I knew her she never said anything to me that wasn't 
             scornful, derisive or contemptuous. 
        **Roz:** So how come she made you in charge of her memorial?
    **Frasier:** I was her favourite!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Daphne is cutting Martin's hair at the dinner table whilst he reads 
    the paper.  Niles and Frasier enter with bags and they ad-lib 
    greetings.  Frasier notices Eddie rolling on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, I thought we had an agreement: Eddie doesn't roll around 
             on the sofa and I don't throw him in front of a bus!
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, hello Dr. Crane.  Will you be joining us for dinner?
      **Niles:** If it's not too much trouble.  It's Maris's night to host 
             her book club and they are more comfortable not having a man 
             there.
    **Frasier:** Yes, apparently Niles makes the ladies self-conscious.
      **Niles:** Well, I sat in on the last discussion and Mrs. Esterbrook- 
             Kindred developed a facial tic every time she had to say the 
             word "Balzac."
     **Martin:** So how did it go with Aunt Louise's lawyer?  Did you get the 
             old bat's affairs straightened out?
      **Niles:** Ask her yourself.
    _Niles places her urn on the table.  This causes Eddie to run off down 
    the corridor to Martin's room._
    
    **Frasier:** Apparently, it was Aunt Louise's wish that Niles dispose of 
             her ashes.
      **Niles:** Now the pressure's on me to find the perfect place for her 
             to rest for eternity.  I haven't the faintest idea what to 
             do with her.
     **Martin:** Why don't you just flush her down the toilet?
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, you can't do that!
     **Martin:** Why not?  She loved the water.
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, that's it: the beach.  Oh, no, no, she hated seagulls.  
             And vice-versa. [_then:_] Oh, oh, oh... no! [_then:_] It doesn't 
             matter where I pick, you know it's not going to be good 
             enough.  Whatever I did she always found fault.  Remember when 
             I used to mow her lawn?
    **Frasier:** Yes, what about the Christmas tree I bought her?
      **Niles:** The ashtray I made at camp?
    **Frasier:**[_imitating her:_] "Is that the best you can do?  It wobbles!"
      **Niles:**[_to urn:_] I wish I had that ashtray now!
     **Martin:** So when's the memorial service?
    **Frasier:** It's two weeks after tomorrow.  Lucky lucky me, her last 
             request was that I deliver the eulogy. 
     **Daphne:** Oh come on now, you can handle it.  You just stand up there 
             and say a few nice things.
    **Frasier:** There aren't any!
     **Daphne:** Then just make them up.  Everyone lies a little in eulogies.
    **Frasier:** No Daphne, I refuse to invent virtues the woman didn't have. 
             I'll just have to find something good I can honestly say 
             about her.
     **Martin:**[_stands:_] Good luck!  She was nothing but a crabby, tight- 
             fisted old pain.  All she ever did was sit around that house 
             day after day watching TV.  She kept that same old cruddy 
             furniture all her life.
    _Martin sits down in his old chair in front of the box prompting Niles 
    and Frasier to give a stare at each other._  
    
     **Martin:** What? 
    _But Niles and Frasier just skate round the issue and sit on the sofa._
      **Niles:** Oh, remember how she always used to complain about the 
             winters?
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, every year she was going to take a trip to the 
             South Pacific.  It was her big dream.  But would she spend 
             the money?  Nooooo.  She just sat around whining all the 
             time about how she'd like to be in a warmer climate.
    **Frasier:** My guess is she finally made it. 
     **Daphne:**[_hinting:_] I think it would be terribly bad to go through 
             life having a secret dream and never fulfilling it.  You'd 
             never do anything silly like that, would you Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** What're you talking about?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I don't know.  Perhaps a little something involving a 
             certain shoebox you keep hidden.
    **Frasier:** Shoebox?
     **Martin:** Forget it, it's not important.
     **Daphne:** Oh fine, if you don't want to talk about it, don't talk 
             about it.  It's only something you've given over thirty 
             years of your life to.
     **Martin:** Hey, I didn't tell you that so you can go around blabbing it 
             to everyone.
    **Frasier:** Tell us, dad, what's in the shoe box?
     **Martin:** Nothing, all right?
    
    _Everyone starts encouraging Martin to tell everyone so he does._
    
     **Martin:** It's just some songs I wrote... for Frank Sinatra.
     **Daphne:** And he keeps them in his shoebox.
     **Martin:** I think your work here is done.
    
    _Daphne darts off down the corridor to Martin's room._
    
     **Martin:** Your mother and I used to listen to Sinatra all the time.  
             I know most of his songs by heart.  I guess I got it into 
             my head one day that I'd try to write a song myself.  I'd 
             be at the station house or on a stakeout, I'd get an idea 
             and pretty soon I had a shoebox full.  I used to imagine 
             your mother and I seeing Frank in the stands in Vegas and 
             he'd open the show with one of my songs.
    **Frasier:** Oh gee, dad, why did you never tell us about this?
     **Martin:** Because it is stupid.  They were no good...
      **Niles:** Oh...
     **Martin:** And don't bother to ask, I'm not letting you see 'em.
    
    _Daphne rushes in with the shoebox._
    
     **Daphne:** Here they are. Just like I told you, in his shoebox.
      **Niles:**[_reads:_] "You are the song my soul would sing."
    **Frasier:** Very poetic.
      **Niles:**[_reads:_] "You make my heart go ring-a ding-ding."
     **Martin:** That was during Frank's ring-a-ding period.
    **Frasier:** Lord, this shoebox is full of them. [_reads:_] "I didn't mean 
             to hurt her, she made me lose my mind".
     **Martin:** Hey, lemme see that! [_reads then:_] No, that's just some 
             confession I took from a guy.  The lyrics are on the back. 
             Anyway, I never finished them.  They were never any good. 
             [_picks one up_] Well, except this.  I gotta admit this has 
             got "Frank Sinatra" written all over it.
      **Niles:**[_reads:_] "She's such a groovy lady."
     **Martin:** It's still got that nice contemporary sound.
     **Daphne:** So, why don't you send it to old Blue Eyes?
     **Martin:** No, they're just words scribbled on a piece of paper.  The 
             tune's in my head, I don't know how to write it down.
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles and I do.  You've got the tune in your head, why 
             don't you let us write it down for you?
    
    _They begin arguing over this and Martin decides it's a bad idea.  
    So Daphne is tactical._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, you're wasting your breath trying to convince him to do 
             something.
    **Frasier:** Dad, come on. [_he refuses:_] Yeah, you're probably right.  
             You just sit there night after night watching TV until the 
             time finally comes when we collect your ashes and scatter 
             them over that chair - where they'll probably go unnoticed.
     **Martin:**[_realising:_] All right, okay.
    
    _Niles and Frasier are overjoyed and run to the piano.  Niles sits 
    down claiming he'll be sitting at the piano, however Frasier isn't too 
    happy about this.  Martin goes up near to the piano and they begin._
    
     **Martin:** Okay, so boys, the way I'm hearing the intro, it goes 
             something like this.
    
    _Martin shouts a weird noise mixed with bwobbety-bwas, scobba-doobas, 
    and finishing an unearthly noise sounding like "bwaaaaaa!"_
    
      **Niles:** Of course, it is your piano. 
    
    _Niles stands up, however Frasier pushes him back into his seat 
    realising that he ended up with the best job after all.
    
    End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment - Night.
    
    Niles is at the piano.  Frasier is stood up behind him and Martin is 
    sat on a high chair by the piano.  It's late at night, and all three
    men are in their undershirts.  Niles is playing the conclusion to 
    the song, and Martin is happily snapping his fingers in time to it._
    
     **Martin:** No, no, it goes: Groovy lady of mine, ba-ba-ba-bap-bam-ba-a-
             aaa-a-a-a!
      **Niles:** Like: [_plays something along those lines_]
     **Martin:** No, no, come on, this is the big finish.  Ba-ba-bap-bam-ba-a-
             aaa-a-a-a!
    **Frasier:** Dad, dad, in Niles's defense, after four hours your "ba-bap-
             ba-ba-a-a-a's sound a lot like your "scoopety, boop, bop, 
             bam!"  Right, Niles, let's just try it again.
    
    _Niles tries and it's perfect._
    
     **Martin:** Yeah!  That's it.
      **Niles:** All right?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  Let's hear the chorus one last time.
    
    _Niles begins playing and Frasier gets ready to sing:_
    
    **Frasier:** She's such a groovy lady,
             She makes my heart go heidi-hiedi,
             She is the chick I spend my nights dreaming off...
    
    **Frasier:**[_stops:_] Niles. [_Niles stops_] Dad, I don't mean to criticise.  
             You know that "heidi-hiedi?"  It sounds like Cab Calloway sung 
             backwards. 
     **Martin:** You got any better suggestions?
      **Niles:** Er, yes, yes: "She's like a wood, all cool and shady!"
    **Frasier:** No, no: "She makes the bravest cat go 'fraidy!"
    
    _They disagree.  Daphne enters with coffee._
    
     **Daphne:** I've got it: "She could have slept with Warren Beatty!"
    **Frasier:**[_patronising:_] Very nice Daphne, no.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm sticking with my one, keep singing.
    
    _Niles starts playing and Frasier starts singing._
    
    **Frasier:** Her lips are red as ruby,
             She makes my heart go scooby dooby,
             She is the broad who makes me coo-coo in the heart.
    
    _Niles stops playing and Frasier stops singing._
    
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to quibble but it seems 
             like her heart is always going heidi-hiedi, ringy-dingy, or 
             scooby dooby.
     **Martin:** Look, I don't need another critic.
      **Niles:** Fine, perhaps a cardiologist?
     **Martin:** In all due respect, I think I'm a little more tuned in to 
             what Frank likes and this is pretty close to perfect the way 
             it is.
    **Frasier:** Well?
     **Martin:** How about that!  Thirty years and I've finally finished it.
    **Frasier:** Never too late.
    
    _They all thank each other._
    
     **Martin:** Yeah, first thing tomorrow, I'm mailing it to Frank's people. 
             A little help from Lady Luck, maybe they'll kick it upstairs 
             to the chairman himself. [_starts singing:_] "She's such a 
             groovy lady, [_throws sweater over his shoulder:_] She makes my 
             heart go heidi-hiedi..." [_walks off_]
    
    _The Crane brothers and Daphne look on with an air of pride as the 
    scene FADES OUT.
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Two weeks later it is the morning of Aunt Lousie's funeral.  Frasier 
    is still writing his eulogy on paper.  However, he takes the paper, 
    rips it up and starts again.  A photo album is also laid out on the 
    table.  Martin enters._
    
     **Martin:** Oh Jeez!  The service is in an hour.  Aren't you finished 
             with that eulogy yet?
    **Frasier:** I can't even come up with a first line.  I got this old 
             photo album, probably one of her pictures might inspire me.
     **Martin:** How about this: "We all loved Aunt Louise, even if the 
             camera didn't!" [_laughs with Frasier_]
     **Daphne:**[_enters with a tissue - her voice sounds like she has a cold:_] 
             Dr. Crane, you've been agonising over this for two weeks.  
             Perhaps it's time to start bending the truth a little.
    **Frasier:** No, I refuse to lie.
     **Martin:** Why?
     **Daphne:** I find it hard to believe there isn't one nice story you can 
             tell about her.  Maybe a cute little saying she used?
    **Frasier:** I'm not sure that, "Stop crying, or I'll give you something 
             to cry about" would qualify.
    
    _Martin opens the front door and begins to leave._
    
     **Daphne:** Where are you off to?
     **Martin:** Just going to go check the mail.
    
    _Martin exits._
    
     **Daphne:** I wish they'd just give him an answer about that song.  He 
             must have made a hundred trips to the mailbox during the 
             past two weeks. [_sneezes_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, bless you, Daphne.  Are you sure you're up to coming to 
             the memorial?
     **Daphne:** Oh, it's just a little cold. [_blows nose_] Besides, in my 
             family, when there was a funeral everybody went.  I remember 
             when Grammy Moon passed on.  My brothers had been off on a 
             three-day bender.  They couldn't even stand on their own - 
             pissed as newts!  But they crawled to that chapel on their 
             hands and knees. 
    **Frasier:** Very commendable.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well, they had an obligation.  They were the 
             pallbearers.
    
    _The doorbell sounds.  Daphne answers to Niles with the urn._
    
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Oh dear Lord, Niles, don't tell me you haven't disposed of 
             those ashes yet. 
      **Niles:** Frasier, I have taken them to a dozen locations.  Fossy 
             glade, a babbling brook, a moonlit pond.  None of them felt 
             right, what am I going to do?
    **Frasier:** Well, winter's coming.  The sidewalks are always slippery. 
             I'm having the same problem with the eulogy!
      **Niles:**[_sees album_] Oh, remember when this photo was taken - the 
             day Aunt Lousie took me to Wilson's Meadow to fly a kite?  
             It cost her 35 cents and when it got stuck in a tree she 
             made me climb up after it.  I fell out, broke my collarbone 
             in two places.  I think that's the only time I saw her laugh. 
             [_inspired_] Frasier!  I think she might be happy there!
    **Frasier:** Niles, I think you might be right.
      **Niles:** And even if she's not, let's still do it.
    
    _Martin enters, looking sad._
    
     **Daphne:** Any news about your song?
     **Martin:** Nah.  Listen, we better get started.
    **Frasier:** All right.  Perhaps I'll have some inspiration on the way 
             over in the car.
      **Niles:** And Wilson's Meadow is on the way.  We can stop and scatter 
             the ashes.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
     **Daphne:** Well, this sounds like a family affair.  Maybe I'll take my  
             car and meet you there.
     **Martin:** All right, let's go.
      **Niles:** Wilson's Meadow is the perfect place.  Aunt Louise, you've 
             tormented me for two weeks and finally I've shown you I can 
             do something right.
    
    _Martin, Frasier and Niles exit the front door.  After a pause Niles 
    enters again to pick up the urn of ashes he left behind._
    
      **Niles:**[_to urn:_] Oh, shut up!
    
    _Niles exits with urn.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Wilson's Meadow.
    The three pull up in the car - Frasier driving, Niles in the 
    passenger seat and Martin in the back._
    
      **Niles:** Here, here, yes, yes.  Perfect. [_about urn:_] There's something 
             rattling in here.  Like some great grisly morata.
    _Niles gets out.  Throughout the following conversation between Martin 
    and Frasier we see Niles trying to get the urn open unsuccessfully. 
    He even hits it against a tree and jumps on it._
    
    **Frasier:** What am I going to say at this memorial?
     **Martin:** Don't ask me.
    **Frasier:** You write lyrics, don't ya? 
     **Martin:** Right!  Tell that to Sinatra!
    **Frasier:** Oh, dad, it's a good sing.  I even caught myself singing it 
             in the shower this morning.
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Just because you haven't heard anything yet doesn't mean... 
             you have heard something?
     **Martin:** Yeah. [_takes out letter:_] This morning they rejected it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry, dad.
     **Martin:** Oh, it's okay.  Sinatra must gets thousands of songs sent to 
             him.  What did I expect?
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, at least you gave it your best shot.
     **Martin:** Yeah, I guess.  I mean, sure it would have been nice to hear 
             it sung, but hey, I finished it, finally!  Yeah, I walked 
             down that highway, and climbed that mountain, and reached 
             for the stars. [_realising lyric-like sentence_] Oh sure, 
             now I get hot!
    
    _Niles opens the car door._
    
      **Niles:** I can't open the damn urn!
    **Frasier:**[_gets out:_] Oh, you are so helpless!  For Pete's sake, give it to me, 
             give it to me.
    
    _Frasier yanks the lip open.  However, the ashes gust out and cover 
    Niles and Frasier.  They try to dust themselves clean.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Church.
    It's the memorial service.  Daphne is sat down on the front row. 
    Martin and Niles join her._
    
     **Martin:** It looks like Louise's whole rest home showed up.  It must be 
             "Liver & Onions Day" in the cafeteria. 
     **Daphne:** Apparently when they heard it was Frasier Crane from the 
             radio speaking, the whole rest home turned out.  Can't wait 
             to hear what he has to say.
      **Niles:** Neither can he: He's huddled in the rectory still working on 
             his first sentence.
     **Daphne:** How did the scattering go?  Were there any problems?
      **Niles:** No, nothing important.
    
    _Niles takes off his shoe and empties some ashes out onto the floor. 
    The service begins._
    
    **Minister:** Dear friends, thank you all for coming today.  I know how 
              very deeply your friendship was treasured by Louise.  We 
              are privileged to have with us her favourite nephew, one of 
              Seattle's most eloquent speakers, Dr. Frasier Crane.  Dr. 
              Crane has spent the last fortnight reflecting on what 
              Louise meant to him.  Dr. Crane?
    
    _Frasier takes the stand.  Everyone listens intently._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, well, well.  What can I say about Aunt Louise?  What can 
             I say?  Louise... touched us all. [_dusts his clothes:_] In 
             fact, she touches us still. [_dusts again_] Aunt Louise... loved 
             to teach us all lessons.  You know, it's hard to picture her 
             without hearing her saying, "I'm going to teach you a lesson."  
             What particularly comes to mind, by the very way she lived her 
             own life: she taught us how important it is to pursue our 
             dreams. [_Martin looks up_] Whether we succeed or fail, what 
             really matters is that we tried.  And now as we say goodbye to 
             Louise, a phrase comes to mind.  It was coined by my very own 
             father... "She's Such A Groovy Lady."
    
    _Niles, Daphne and Martin look at each other in confusion._
    
    **Frasier:** I said, "She's Such A Groovy Lady."
    
    _The organist starts up playing the music.  The choir stands:_
    
      **Choir:** Oh, that groovy lady,
             Oh, that groovy lady...
    
    _Frasier also conducts it._
    
      **Choir:** She's such a groovy lady,
             She makes my heart go heidi-hiedi,
             She is the chick I spend my nights dreaming of.
    
             Her lips are red as ruby,
             She makes my heart go scooby dooby,
             She makes me wanna shout "Hey Vagers, above!"
    
             She's got the whole world swinging,
             She makes my heart start ringing-dinging,
           
             That hubba hubba groovy lady of mine,
             Of mine, of mine,
           
             That hubba hubba groovy lady of mine,
             Oh yeah,
             Oh yeah...
    
       **Base:** Yeah!
      **Choir:** Yeah!
    
    _Niles, Daphne and Martin have been dancing in their seats and clap 
    along with the congregation and the studio audience. 
    
    End Of Act Two._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    In the church, the cleaner comes around sweeping the floors.  
    He spots the ash of Louise out of Niles'S shoe and puts it 
    in the bin.
