    _PROLOGUE_
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] Previously on _Frasier_...
    _This episode is the second in a two-parter (the first being "Sleeping
    With The Enemy," and begins with a montage of four clips from the
    previous episode: 
    
    - Roz telling Frasier that Kate has cancelled the KACL staffers' annual 
      pay raise; 
    
    - Frasier and Kate arguing and then kissing; 
    
    - Martin suggesting to Frasier that Kate may have been trying to 
      manipulate him; 
    
    - Finally, Frasier and Kate negotiating and then kissing, again.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Cafe Nervosa
    Niles has just been served his coffee.  He is walking away from the 
    bar when he sees Frasier entering._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Damn, I didn't think you'd be here...
    
    _He takes off his coat and puts it on the coat-hanger._
    
      **Niles:** Well, I would've gone to my regular haunt, but "The Pig 'N 
             Swig" is closed for remodelling.
    _He sits down at a free table with his back to the doorway, and is
    joined by Frasier, who settles opposite him._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Niles, it's just... I'm meeting Kate here.  We want 
             to discuss the little dilemma in which we find ourselves.
    _Niles, nonchalant, sets about pouring some sugar into his coffee._
    
      **Niles:** If you're talking about the little kiss you two shared, 
             that hardly constitutes a dilemma.  It's not as if you 
             plunged into a tawdry office affair.
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** Then you'd have a real problem.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** A kiss?  It's _nothing_.
    **Frasier:**[_looking somewhat uncomfortable_] Right.
      **Niles:** Had _sex_ with her, didn't you?
    
    _He sips his coffee, giving Frasier a sharp look._
    
    **Frasier:** I didn't mean to!  It just... happened!  One minute we were
             negotiating, the next minute our inhibitions were shattered, 
             along with my kneecap and her Macintosh PowerBook.
      **Niles:**[_surprised_] This happened in her office?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** What are you saying?  Her couch folds out?
    **Frasier:** We used her desk.
      **Niles:** Her desk folds out?!
    
    _Frasier sees Kate entering._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles, anxious_] There she is!  Look, look, just make an
             excuse and go, okay? [_stands up_]
      **Niles:** Alright, okay. [_to Kate_] Ah, Miss Costas. [_stands up_]
       **Kate:** Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:**[_glances at his watch_] Oh, look at the time!  I, er, have a 
             session with my multiple personality.
    **Frasier:** Ah.
      **Niles:** Well, not to worry.  If I'm late he can just talk amongst 
             himself. [_laughs_]
    
    _Frasier motions at him to get out.  Niles leaves._
    
       **Kate:** So... good morning.
    **Frasier:** Good morning.
    
    _They sit down; Kate takes Niles's place._
    
       **Kate:** How's your knee?
    **Frasier:** Ah.  Well er, it's better, thanks.
    **Frasier:** And... and your laptop? [_off her confused look_] I refer to 
             your computer.
       **Kate:** A little dented, but fine. [_smiles_] The computer.
    **Frasier:** Ah.  Anyway, what I wanted to tell you was that, well, last 
             night was one of the greatest nights of lovemaking I've had 
             since... Roz!
       **Kate:** Tell me she just walked in.
    
    _Roz walks in._
    
        **Roz:** Well, hi!  Guess you guys kissed and made up, huh?
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.  We were just 
             discussing the step system in a new healthcare plans co-
             payment scheme and... well, it wouldn't interest you.
        **Roz:** Oh, the hell it wouldn't! [_sits at their table_] You know 
             they're too cheap to pay for a butt-lift?  I sit on this 
             thing all day long, that's work-related!
    
    _Kate stands up.  So does Frasier._
    
       **Kate:** Listen, I really have to go, but I would like to discuss 
             this matter at the first possible opportunity.
    **Frasier:** So would I.
       **Kate:**[_turns to leave, but stops_] Oh, oh, oh, oh, I almost forgot.  
             I need you two to fill in the eight-to-ten slot tonight.  
             Floyd, the Happy Chef, is in rehab again.
    **Frasier:** Ah.
    
    [_N.B. In other episodes, the Happy Chef's name has been given as Leo._]
    
    _Kate leaves._
    
        **Roz:**[_fed up_] Oh, great!  I was supposed to have dinner with a 
             successful, handsome doctor! [_Frasier sits down again_] She 
             thinks we're all as happy to work all night as she is.
    **Frasier:** Mmm.
        **Roz:** Well, you're a psychiatrist, Frasier.  She's a cold, repressed 
             workaholic who has no sex life whatsoever.  Can't you help her?
    **Frasier:**[_deadpan_] I've tried, Roz.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.  
    Martin is in The Armchair reading a newspaper; Daphne is at the dining 
    table doing some ironing; Eddie is sitting on one of the chairs at the 
    dining table.  Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] Why do we bother having a service elevator?  I just 
             rode up nineteen floors with two sweaty moving men munching on 
             chili-dogs which they proceeded to drip onto my suede shoes. 
             [_looks down and points_] How will I ever get that stain out?
    _Eddie jumps off his chair, runs over to Frasier, and licks the chili
    off helpfully._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes.  Dog saliva!  Nature's miracle solvent. [_hangs up 
             his coat_] So who's moving out anyway?
     **Daphne:** Deirdre Sauvage, the one who writes the romance novels.
     **Martin:** Yeah, the lost Gabor sister's finally outta here.
     **Daphne:** Well, she's a very sweet person and I'm going to miss her.
     **Martin:** Well, you're not the one she's always undressing with her 
             eyes.  She lured me into her apartment one time, supposedly 
             to fix a lamp.  Next thing I know, I got a drink in my hand 
             and she's reading me a dirty poem about meadow walks.
    **Frasier:** Well, I must admit she's never done that to me.
     **Martin:** Yeah well, if she does, don't fake a charley horse to get 
             outta there.  She'll just try to rub it!
     **Daphne:** Speaking of romance, Dr. Crane... when I washed your shirt
             this morning, I couldn't help noticing lipstick in the oddest 
             places.  I'll take it negotiations went well last night...?
    **Frasier:** I'd rather not discuss it, thank you.
     **Martin:** Why, is there a problem?
    
    _Frasier sits down on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Things between me and Kate just went a little faster than I
             intended.
     **Daphne:** I'll say!  There were also four buttons missing, and teeth-
             marks in the shoulders!
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Inspector Moon!  Things got a little out of hand.  
             I think we should slow down a bit but er, I'm afraid to tell 
             her for fear of hurting her feelings.  Daphne, how about a 
             woman's perspective?  Let's just say, for argument's sake, 
             that you and I succumbed to a, a night of passion...
     **Daphne:** What, you and me? [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Yes...
     **Daphne:** What - bosoms heaving, shirt buttons catapulting through the 
             air?
    **Frasier:** It's a hypothetical question!
     **Daphne:** I'll say it is! [_laughs again_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, alright, somebody else!  Alright?  So, you have a, a mad
             tryst with this young man, and then the next day he says that 
             he thinks things are going too fast; he'd like to slow down.  
             What would you say?
     **Daphne:** I suppose I'd say, "Thanks for being honest.  You're probably 
             right, we were moving too fast." [_suddenly bitter_] "Not that 
             it was too fast for you last night.  Ohh, no, we were right on 
             schedule then, weren't we?" [_seemingly in her own world_] "But, 
             now you've had your fun - though not too much, apparently -- 
             and you want to be my friend.  Well you can just sod off, 
             Trevor Mulgrew!!!"
    
    _She notices that Frasier and Martin are staring at her._
    
     **Daphne:**[_shaky_] You know, I think I might have some buttons for this
             shirt...
    
    _She hurries off to her room._
    
    **Frasier:** You see, dad - the whole thing's a minefield.
     **Martin:** Ah, you'll never learn, will you?  Handling a woman's easy!
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier goes to get it._
    
     **Martin:** You know, you kill me.  Mister Psychiatrist, you've always
             gotta make everything so complicated.  A woman comes on too
             strong, you just tell her to cool her engines!  It's the
             easiest thing in the world.
    **Frasier:**[_opens the door_] Oh, Deirdre!
    
    _As soon as he hears this, Martin leaps out of The Armchair and heads
    for his room, terrified._
    
    **Frasier:** I understand you're leaving us.
    **Deirdre:**[_British accent_] Alas, yes!
    **Frasier:** Oh, do come in!
    **Deirdre:** Thank you.
    
    _She enters.  Deirdre is a not-greatly-attractive, middle-aged woman 
    in blue attire._
    
    [_N.B. "Deirdre Sauvage" is the name of a romance novelist character 
    in one of Joe Keenan's early novels, "Blue Heaven."_]
    _Martin is almost out of the room when Deirdre sees him.  Naturally, 
    he has to give up - and disguise - his escape attempt._
    
    **Deirdre:**[_excited_] Ohhh hello, Martin!
    
    _Martin forces a smile and hobbles over to her._
    
    **Deirdre:** You've been so kind to me - I wanted to give you my new 
             address.
    
    _She gives him a piece of paper, which he accepts with much-feigned
    enthusiasm._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, great!  I'd hate to lose touch!
    **Deirdre:** I also wanted to bring you a farewell gift: my latest novel,
             "Foolish Escapade."  It's the long-awaited sequel to "The Rose
             and the Rapier."
    
    _She gives him a paperback book, which he accepts in the same manner 
    as before._
    
     **Martin:** Swell!
    **Deirdre:**[_starts to stroke Martin's arm, flirtatiously_] I was er, 
             thinking of you when I created the character of Lorenzo, 
             the lovesick gondolier...
     **Martin:**[_laughs_] How 'bout that?  Hah!  Hey, where are my manners?
             Let me show you out!
    
    _He takes her arm and tries to lead her towards the doorway, but she
    stays put._
    
    **Deirdre:** Oh, by the way, the lock on my suitcase is jammed.  I was 
             er, hoping that you'd come and... [_strokes Martin's face, 
             very flirtatiously_] _tinker_ with it?
    
    _Martin leads her into the doorway again, this time successfully._
    
     **Martin:** Oh gee, you know, I'd love to, Deirdre.  But I, I promised
             Frasier I'd do something with him tonight.
    
    _Having deposited her in the hallway, he turns back into the apartment..._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh oh, dad, didn't I mention it?  I'm filling in for The Happy 
             Chef tonight... 
    _Martin, his back to Deirdre, furiously mouths, "SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!  
    SHUT UP!"_
    
    **Frasier:**...so, you're all hers!
    **Deirdre:**[_thrilled_] Oh, marvelous!
    
    _She grabs him by the arm and drags him out.  Martin has enough time 
    to give Frasier a look that combines rage and terror._
    
    **Frasier:** Goodnight, Lorenzo.
    
    _He closes the door.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **THE ADVENTURES OF
    BAD BOY AND DIRTY GIRL**
    
    _Scene Three - KACL.  
    Frasier is in the studio.  Roz, who is dressed for a night out, 
    is in her booth, busy putting on make-up._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Polly.  How can I help you?
      **Polly:**[_v.o._] Oh, I'm so glad I got through!  I'm sitting here not 
             knowing what to do.  I find myself lacking a certain spice.
    **Frasier:** Well Polly, if you want to shake up your routine, why don't 
             you er, try something new and dangerous?  Er, skydiving, 
             belly-dancing, perhaps?  That ought to add some spice.
      **Polly:** What are you talking about?!  I'm making an apple tart and 
             I'm out of cinnamon!
    **Frasier:** I see. [_disconnects her_] Listeners, for the fourth time 
             this hour, I am NOT The Happy Chef.  I am The Irritated 
             Psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane!  We'll be right back after 
             the news.
    
    _Roz grimaces as Frasier gets up and enters her booth.  Obviously, 
    she has been less than attentive to her call-screening duties._
    
    **Frasier:** And while we're on the subject of tarts...
        **Roz:** I'm really sorry about that call.
    **Frasier:** No, it's alright, Roz.  Why don't you just run along for 
             your date?  I can handle the last ten minutes here.
        **Roz:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** Sure!
    
    _Roz, visibly eager to leave, grabs her handbag and stands up._
    
        **Roz:** I mean, I feel terrible leaving you here alone in the lurch.
             [_whisks her coat off the back of her chair and rushes to the 
             door_] We are a team, Frasier; you just say the word and I'll 
             stay... [_shouts_] Hey, hold that elevator!
    _She leaves hurriedly.  Frasier shuts the side door.  Kate enters the 
    studio._
    
       **Kate:** Got a minute?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  Er, look, I, I'm glad you're still here. [_closes 
             the door to the booth_]  Er, listen...
       **Kate:** No-no-no, me first this time.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
       **Kate:**[_clears throat_] I really think that we should slow things 
             down.
    **Frasier:**[_relieved_] Oh, I am so glad you said that!  I wanted to say
             the same thing but I was, I was afraid that you'd feel I was
             rejecting you!
       **Kate:** Oh, how sensitive.  And yet, at the same time, how full of
             yourself.
    **Frasier:**[_amused_] You are one tough nut, lady.
       **Kate:**[_relaxed_] Well, all this definitely shows we're doing the
             right thing.
    **Frasier:** Agreed.  Frankly, now that we've got that settled, do you mind 
             if I ask you a question about last night?
       **Kate:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** What the hell was that?!
       **Kate:** I have no idea!  I... ever since I've gotten here, you have 
             done nothing but irritate me like a persistent skin rash.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and you me!  And, and, and last night was no different.  
             You just kept talking and talking and talking, and I guess 
             that mouth of yours just ticked me off so much I just had to 
             have it!
       **Kate:** The whole thing... it's just, it's so primitive!
    **Frasier:** Yeah, yeah, animal!  We were just functioning on instinct.
       **Kate:** It's fascinating, really.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, let's not dismiss the element of danger - all those
             people outside that could have walked in any moment and
             caught us.
       **Kate:** That crossed my mind...
    **Frasier:** For once, in my cautious, buttoned-down life, I felt like a 
             real bad boy.
       **Kate:**[_sheepish_] I felt like a...dirty girl.
    **Frasier:**[_intrigued_] What did you just call yourself?
       **Kate:**[_unashamed_] I said "dirty girl." 
    
    _A mischievous look appears on her face._
    
       **Kate:**[_flirtatious_] You bad boy. [_grins excitedly_]
    **Frasier:**[_aroused and mock-disapproving_] You dirty girl.
       **Kate:**[_sexily_] You bad boy!
    **Frasier:** Dirty girl!
       **Kate:**[_whispers_] Bad boy...!!
    **Frasier:**[_excited_] Dirty girl...!!
    
    _They kiss, violently.  
    
    Cut to outside the studio, looking in through the window; we see 
    Frasier and Kate anxiously stagger to the window and close the blinds.  
    
    Cut back to inside.  Still holding each other, they bump up against the 
    studio console and lie on top of it, snogging rabidly._
    
       **Kate:**[_urgent_] How much time do we have left on the news?
    **Frasier:** Three minutes. [_kisses her_]
       **Kate:** Right... [_kisses him_]
    **Frasier:** But that's alright, I can play lots of extra commercials!
             [_kisses her_]
       **Kate:** Oh good, [_kisses him_] good!
    
    _CUT TO: Frasier's apartment.  Martin and Daphne are sitting at the 
    dining table, playing dominoes; Eddie is on a chair near them.  The
    radio is on and tuned to KACL._
    
    **Newscast:**[_on radio:_] In local news, Congressman Robert Gill was 
              accused of accepting bribes from a waste treatment facility.  
              Asked to comment, the congressman said-
     **Frasier:**[_cuts in suddenly; orgasmic_] Yes!  YES!!!  I am a bad boy, 
              aren't I, you dirty girl!  Come to your bad boy!
    _Martin and Daphne freeze and look toward the radio in shock; 
    Eddie does the same.
    
    CUT TO: Niles listening to this in his car, agape.  We view this 
    through a camera on the car's bonnet, looking through the windscreen._
    **Frasier:**[_on radio:_] Oh, _yes_... Oh, no!  Is that the on-air light? 
       **Kate:**[_on radio, whispering:_] Stop talking.
    **Frasier:** You must have hit the switch with your elbow while we were...
       **Kate:**[_more urgent_] Stop talking! 
    **Frasier:** We'd better hurry up and get dressed while we still...
      **Niles:**[_stares at the radio_] Stop talking!
    _Niles returns his attention to the road, but he has been looking away
    for too long.  He brakes hard, but crashes into the car in front.  
    The airbag inflates, trapping him in his seat; he struggles weakly 
    behind it.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **DIRTY GIRL, SIGN IN PLEASE**
    
    _Scene One - KACL
    The next day, before show time.  There are several newspapers on the 
    console.  Frasier enters, and sees Roz waiting for him with one of 
    them in her hand._
    
        **Roz:**[_triumphant_] Okay, Fabio, I want two things.  One: you will
             never make another crack about _my_ sex life.  I don't care if
             I start dating a lumber camp.
    **Frasier:** Done.
        **Roz:** And two: who's Dirty Girl? [_smiles_]
    **Frasier:** I can't tell you that.
        **Roz:** Oh, come on, Frasier!  I swear, I won't tell a soul!
    
    _The phone on the console rings.  Roz answers it._
    
        **Roz:** Yes? [_turns away from Frasier, lowers voice:_] Not yet, 
             I'll call you back.
    
    _She puts the phone down and gets a distrustful glare from Frasier.
    Bulldog enters._
    
    **Bulldog:** Doc, I got one thing to say to you...
    **Frasier:** Go ahead, take your best shot.
    **Bulldog:**[_in genuine admiration_] I am so proud of you, man.
    
    _He hugs Frasier, who is very unmoved._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, doesn't that just put the cherry on the parfait.
    **Bulldog:** Now come on, you gotta tell me - who's the mystery chick?
    **Frasier:** Bulldog, haven't you already seen? [_points to the newspapers_] 
             I've told half a dozen reporters that I'm not going to name 
             names.
        **Roz:**[_holds up a newspaper_] Yeah, don't you see this right here?  
             "'I Won't Fink,' Says Kinky Shrink."
    _Roz and Bulldog laugh; Frasier looks fed up.  Then, a rather 
    uncomfortable-looking Kate creeps into the studio._
    
       **Kate:** Good afternoon, Dr Crane.
    **Frasier:** Miss Costas.
    **Bulldog:** Hey, hey, you're the boss - make him tell who his playmate 
             was.
       **Kate:** Bulldog, this is really none of your business.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, but we got a pool going.  So far, hot money's on Roz.
        **Roz:** What?!  Oh, well, thank you, but I think I have a little more
             self-respect than to have a quickie with a co-worker on the 
             air!  What kind of slut do they think I am?
       **Kate:**[_extremely uncomfortable_] Dr. Crane, could I have a word 
             with you in private?
    **Frasier:** Er, I-I'd love that, but I, I've got my show in two minutes.
       **Kate:** Actually you don't.
    **Frasier:** What?
       **Kate:** I'm suspending you for a week. [_to Bulldog_] Bulldog, you're
             going on. [_to Roz_] Roz, you'll have to produce.
    **Bulldog:** Alright!
    
    _He enthusiastically slaps Roz on the butt; she viciously hits him in 
    the stomach with her clipboard._
    
    **Frasier:** I must say, I find that a, a bit harsh, all things considered.
       **Kate:** Yes, I can see how you might feel that way.  But the station
             does have certain standards and it is my job to enforce them.  
             Now if you will excuse me, I have to meet with one of last 
             night's sponsors - The Wholesome Family Cookie Company.
    
    _She leaves.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.  
    Frasier enters.  It is pitch dark, so he presses the light switch.  
    The lights go up and we see Martin, who had been reading a newspaper 
    with the aid of a pen torch, sink into The Armchair in alarm._
    
     **Martin:** Hey!  Turn those lights out!
    
    _Frasier does so and closes the door.  Martin relaxes._
    
    **Frasier:** Why?
     **Martin:** Deirdre hasn't finished moving yet.  If she sees the light 
             in here, she'll know I'm home!  You can see your living room
             from her bedroom.
    **Frasier:** Her bedroom...?
     **Martin:** She had me cornered in there yesterday.  I don't mind 
             telling you, I haven't been that scared since Korea.
    
    _Frasier turns the lights back on and Martin sinks into The Armchair
    again.  Frasier goes to the coat-hanger._
    
    **Frasier:** Don't worry, dad.  Look, I have no intention of letting anyone 
             in here tonight.  There's a damn tabloid news crew down in the 
             lobby.  I had to go in the back way and use the service 
             elevator. [_hangs up his coat_]
     **Martin:** Say, I tuned in to your show tonight.  Why weren't you on it?
    **Frasier:**[_sulky_] If you must know, I've been suspended for a week.
     **Martin:** Oh, no.
    **Frasier:**[_depressed_] I spent the last three hours at the observation 
             deck of the Space Needle, looking down on a city that's 
             looking down on me.
    
    _He sits on the couch and cradles his face in his hands.  Daphne 
    enters from her room._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr Crane.
    **Frasier:** Daphne.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm not here.
     **Daphne:** Yes.  Your father's not here either.  It's so nice having 
             the whole house to myself.
    
    _She opens the door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, how lovely.  Now the whole family's not here.
    
    _She closes the door and goes to sit on the couch armrest, next to
    Frasier.  Niles walks over to the couch._
    
      **Niles:** I listened to your programme as I was driving home last night. 
             [_holds up two pieces of paper_] Here's a bill to replace the 
             front wheel of my Mercedes, and the second to replace the back 
             bumper of some wretched little domestic car.
    _He gives the bills to Frasier, who snatches them off him, annoyed._
    
     **Martin:** Go easy on your brother, Niles - he's had a rough day.
      **Niles:** You're right, dad. [_sits on the couch; sympathetic_] Er,
             Frasier, please accept my apologies.  I, I can imagine 
             how trying this must have been for you.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_unsympathetic again_] 'Course, it's been no picnic for those
             of us who share your name.  My Maris took it particularly
             hard.  When I left this morning, she was ordering new 
             stationery with an _accent aigu_ over the "e" in our name.
             Hereafter, her memos will read, "From the desk of Maris
             Crane." [_pronounces it, "Crah-nay."_]
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Daphne goes to the door and looks through the
    peep-hole._
    
     **Daphne:** Who is it?
       **Kate:**[_outside_] Kate Costas.
    
    _Everyone in the room panics momentarily._
    
    **Frasier:** Wait, wait!  Alright, all of you.  You know nothing about 
             last night!
    
    _Daphne opens the door.  Niles and Martin stand up._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello!
       **Kate:** Hello.
     **Daphne:** Come in!
    _A subdued-looking Kate enters.  Frasier makes some rapid and slightly
    awkward introductions._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Kate. [_gestures at Niles_] Er, you know Niles,  
             of course. [_gestures at Martin_] Er, this is my...
       **Kate:**[_to Martin_] Hello.
    **Frasier:**...father, Martin...
     **Martin:** Hi!
    **Frasier:**...and er, [_points at Daphne_] his healthcare worker.  
             Daphne, Kate Costas.
     **Daphne:** Nice to meet you.
       **Kate:** I'm sorry if I'm coming at a bad time.
     **Martin:** Oh no, no, I, I - we were just taking Eddie for a walk.  
             [_heads towards the door_]
     **Daphne:** Yeah. [_calls to Eddie_] Eddie!
      **Niles:** I have to be running along too.
    _Eddie runs up to Daphne.  Niles and Martin join her near the doorway;
    Martin opens the door._
    
     **Daphne:**[_to Eddie_] Oh, what's that on your chin?  Have you been in 
             the garbage again? [_turns to leave_] You Bad Boy!
    _Everyone freezes, except for bad boy Eddie, who scampers out.  
    Kate is mortified.  After a few moments of very awkward silence, 
    Daphne, Martin and Niles leave hastily, shutting the door behind 
    them._
    
       **Kate:** So... nice place. [_goes towards the balcony_] Whoa, what a 
             view!
    **Frasier:**[_bitter_] Yes.  I'll be enjoying it during my suspension.
       **Kate:** Well... I guess that concludes the small-talk portion of our
             evening.  Look, it must be obvious; I've come here to 
             apologise.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really - for what?  Turning on me when I went out of my 
             way to protect you?  You know we're both responsible for this.  
             Yet I end up looking like an idiot and you look like a no-
             nonsense boss!
       **Kate:** Alright, alright, just tell me what I can do to make this
             right.
    **Frasier:**[_sulky_] Nothing!  There is nothing you can do, there is
             nothing you can say, to make this up to me.
       **Kate:**[_no-nonsense_] The owners wanted you fired.
    **Frasier:**[_beat_] That's pretty good!
    _Frasier feels an odd mixture of shocked relief and embarrassed
    gratitude._
       **Kate:** Look, there's no way we can rewrite the past.  It happened, 
             we did it, it's on tape.  But we can do this: we can prevent 
             it from ever happening again.
    **Frasier:** Agreed.  Obviously, there's some kind of incredible 
             attraction between us.  The trick will be simply to 
             avoid the opportunity.  We're strong, we're intelligent... 
             and we're alone in this apartment.
    
    _They contemplate this for a moment._
    
       **Kate:**[_anxious_] I'll get my bag!
    **Frasier:** Yes...
    
    _RESET TO: the corridor outside Frasier's apartment.  
    Kate emerges and is about to press the button for the elevator when 
    Frasier, following, stops her._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Kate, Kate, er, that news crew's probably still in the
             lobby.
       **Kate:** Oh, right!
    **Frasier:** Let me walk you to the service elevator and see you out.
    
    _He shuts the door of his apartment and they leave down a corridor.  
    
    CUT TO: outside the service elevator.  The doors are open; inside, 
    items of furniture and assorted junk are stacked around the walls.  
    A moving-man is just leaving.  Kate and Frasier enter and walk in._
    
       **Kate:**[_to the moving-man_] Going down?
        **Man:** No, you guys go ahead.  Just send it back up!
    
    _The moving-man leaves.  Kate presses a button and the doors close.
    
    CUT TO: inside the elevator as it begins to descend._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes... well, I'm sure if we really try, we can keep things 
             on a professional footing.
       **Kate:** We're two mature adults.
    **Frasier:** Just have to avoid all undue temptation.
    
    _Suddenly, the elevator shudders to a halt and the lights go out, 
    leaving Frasier and Kate in darkness and silence._
    
    **Frasier:** What's going on?
       **Kate:** I don't know. [_calls out_] Hello?
    **Frasier:** You know, let's have a little light.
    
    _He flicks open his lighter and, by its tiny flame, begins to look
    around inside the elevator._
    
       **Kate:**[_calls out_] Hello?  Hello?  Can anybody hear me?
    
    _The moving-man, from somewhere up above, calls down the elevator
    shaft._
    
        **Man:** Hello?
       **Kate:** Yeah!  What's going on?
    
    _Frasier, having seen some candles in a corner, begins to light them;
    gradually, the elevator is illuminated._
    
        **Man:** Looks like you're stuck.  Same thing happened this morning.  
             Took about half an hour to fix.  You two guys gonna be okay?
       **Kate:** Yeah, yeah, we're fine.  We're adults. [_a little nervous_] 
             We're mature adults!
    _She glances around herself anxiously.  Frasier, having fired up three
    candles, burns his hand lighting a fourth._
    
    **Frasier:** Ow!
    _Nursing his hand, he stumbles against a large object propped up against 
    the back of the elevator, causing it to fall forward and lie flat in 
    the middle of the floorspace.  It turns out to be a large mattress-bed -- 
    big enough to accommodate two.  They eye it uneasily._
    
    **Frasier:** It's getting sort of hot in here, isn't it?
       **Kate:**[_nervous_] Yeah.  It's a bit - it's a bit hot.
    **Frasier:** You don't mind if I take off my jacket, do you?
       **Kate:**[_steadfast_] Makes no difference to me.
    _Frasier takes off his jacket and drops it onto the mattress; he also
    loosens his tie._
    
    **Frasier:** Well.  Looks like we're gonna be here for a little while - 
             may as well try to make ourselves comfortable.
    
    _Their eyes stray towards the mattress..._
    
    **Frasier:** Maybe there are some chairs in here.
    _They both start looking through the stuff piled up against the sides
    of the elevator - Frasier on the left-hand side, and Kate on the right.  
    Frasier sees something next to a dressing-table._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, here we are!  I'll just have to move this down along...
    
    _He pushes the dressing-table, and from somewhere inside it, a music 
    box begins to play - redolent of bedrooms and romance.  They freeze 
    when they hear it._
    
       **Kate:** What's that?
    **Frasier:** I must have knocked open a music box in here somewhere.
    _He opens the dresser.  Inside, he finds fluffy women's panties and an
    array of high-heeled shoes._
    
       **Kate:**[_irritable_] I'm not really in the mood for music.  Could you
             stop that, please?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I'll try.
    
    _He starts to dig into the panties._
    
       **Kate:** God, it's hot in here!
    _As she takes off her jacket, Frasier pulls some frilly clothes out 
    of the dresser.  There is the sound of glass breaking against the 
    floor._
    
       **Kate:** What's that smell?
    
    _Frasier searches the floor._
    
    **Frasier:** I seem to have broken a bottle of something... [_realizes, 
             gazes at her, worried_] Musk oil...!
    _Kate is becoming increasingly tense.  Frasier returns to searching 
    the dresser for the source of the music, pulling open the drawers._
    
    **Frasier:**[_desperate_] Oh, oh, where is that damn music box? [_rifles 
             through another drawer_] Here it is! [_picks it up and turns 
             it off_]
       **Kate:** I really think that it would be a very good thing if you 
             just did something about that musk oil...
    
    _Frasier closes the drawers._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes, alright, er, how about... Oh, I know, hand me that
             drop-cloth there and maybe I can just smother it.
    _He points at what looks like a dusty, mouldy old piece of curtain
    hanging behind Kate.  She takes it off of the wall, revealing a 
    large poster of the cover of a romance novel, featuring a muscular, 
    semi-naked hero embracing a voluptuous, semi-naked heroine; above the 
    lovers, a lurid title reads, "Surrender to Bliss," and below them is 
    the name Deirdre Sauvage.  
    
    Frasier and Kate, upon seeing it, avert their eyes._
    
       **Kate:**[_very tense_] Who lives in this building?!
    **Frasier:** You know er, I think we can just forego the musk oil right 
             now.  Why don't you just cover, cover that back up.
    _Kate dumps the dropcloth onto the mattress and brushes herself off._
    
       **Kate:** No no no no no, not gonna touch this thing again. [_brushes 
             herself off_] Look at me, I'm all dirty.
    _Kate freezes and stares at Frasier, who is himself visibly bursting
    with desire.  Then, finally surrendering to bliss, they dive onto 
    the mattress and grab each other - but, at the last moment, somehow
    manage to hold back from the usual kissing._
    
       **Kate:** Ooh, stop - stop - stop!
    **Frasier:** You're right!
    
    _Still holding onto each other, they take a few relieved breaths._
    
    **Frasier:** We have gazed into the gaping maw of temptation, and survived!
    
    _They separate and sit on the mattress, side-by-side._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of us! [_laughs_]
       **Kate:**[_laughs_] I am, too!  God!
    **Frasier:**[_relaxed_] Ah...
    
    _Kate looks upwards._
    
       **Kate:** Of course, the cable could break.
    **Frasier:**[_tense again_] And we'd be kicking ourselves all the way 
             down...
       **Kate:** You are so right!
    _They kiss, and just like the previous two times, Frasier ends up 
    lying on top of Kate.  Suddenly, the lights come back on and the
    elevator begins to descend again.  They hurriedly get up and set
    about returning the furniture, mattress, clothes, candles, etc., 
    to their original conditions and places.  
    
    CUT TO: outside the elevator on the ground floor, several seconds later.
    A moving-man is waiting.  The doors open.  
    
    Everything looks as it did when they first got on, including Frasier's
    and Kate's attire.  They stand chastely side-by-side, two feet apart._
    
       **Kate:**[_with businesslike impersonality_] Goodnight, Dr Crane.
    **Frasier:**[_same_] Miss Costas.
    
    _Kate leaves.  The moving-man enters and presses a button.  As the 
    elevator doors close, we see Frasier roll his eyes in relief.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    The corridor outside Frasier's apartment.  Martin emerges with Eddie
    on a leash.  He looks around carefully, presses the elevator button,
    and waits close to the elevator doors, nervously keeping his back to
    them.  He continues to scan the corridor and presses the button again
    with impatience.  The elevator doors open and, as he backs into the
    lift, we see that a very excited Deirdre is there; Martin does not
    notice her until it is too late to escape.
