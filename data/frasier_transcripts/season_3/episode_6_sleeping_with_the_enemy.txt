    _ACT ONE_
    
    _Scene One - The Frasier Crane Show.  
    Frasier, on the air, is listening to a caller, and Roz is in her booth.  
    While the caller is talking, Frasier looks into Roz's booth and sees 
    that an agitated-looking Noel has entered.  Noel has a brief 
    conversation with Roz; she looks worried, takes off her headphones, 
    and leaves the booth hurriedly with Noel._
    
       **June:**[_v.o._] Well, my husband is always criticising me, because in
             restaurants I like to listen in on strangers' conversations.
             I don't know why he makes such a big deal out of nothing.
    
    _Through the window behind Frasier, we see that Roz and Noel have
    entered the corridor outside Frasier's studio, and are in a heated
    discussion with various other members of the KACL staff._
    
    **Frasier:** Well June, I suppose your lack of interest makes your 
             husband feel invisible.  Imagine what it must be like 
             to sit [_takes a glance through the window_] across from 
             someone who's constantly scanning, [_picks up the microphone 
             and turns away from the console to looks through the 
             window_] searching, craning their neck to see... Just 
             what the hell is going on out there?
       **June:** Oh gosh, you're right!  I've been insensitive.  It's just
             common decency to stay focused on the other person.
    
    _Frasier, focused on the events outside, has not been listening._
    
    **Frasier:** Huh? [_turns back to his console_] What?  Oh, well, good for
             you, Jane!
       **June:**[_annoyed_] June!
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah, well, whatever!  Er, this is Dr Frasier Crane.  
             KACL 780. [_stabs at a button and rips his headphones off_]
    
    _He gets up and leaves hurriedly via Roz's booth.  
    
    CUT TO: outside Kate's office.  
    An anxious crowd of KACL staffers, among them Roz and Noel, 
    has gathered.  Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** What is going on?
    
    _A few staffers gesture towards a notice board._
    
        **Roz:**[_angry, slaps a memo on the board_] Oh, our beloved station 
             manager decided we're not getting our raise this year!
    **Frasier:**[_furious_] What? [_rips the memo off and crumples it_] This is 
             an outrage!  I have a contract!
        **Roz:** Don't palpitate, it doesn't apply to the on-air talent.
    **Frasier:**[_calm_] Oh, thank God.
    
    _He proceeds to straighten out the crumpled memo and pin it neatly 
    back onto the board.  When he has finished, he notices that the 
    crowd is watching him unhappily._
    
    **Frasier:**[_embarrassed_] I'm sorry... I was being selfish, wasn't I?  
             I, er, feel very ashamed.  It is nevertheless, er, an outrage.
             It's not a personal outrage but certainly a, a family of man
             outrage.
        **Roz:**[_tearful_] Frasier, I spent that raise already - on my new 
             diamond earrings!  I love them.  I love them so much, I 
             slept with them!
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, as long as you're doing it for love, it's a step
             in the right direction!
    
    _He goes to leave._
    
        **Roz:** Real supportive, Frasier!  We've been getting that raise every 
             year, and now this Nazi in nylons comes waltzing in here and 
             cancels it with some vague crap about corporate belt-
             tightening.  This isn't fair!
    
    _The assembled staffers agree._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, actually you're right!  Er you, maybe you should 
             tell her what you just told me.  Er, except I would leave 
             out the "Nazi in nylons" bit.  It's not your best icebreaker.
        **Roz:** Oh, you're damn right we're gonna tell her!
    
    _The staffers cheer._
    
        **Roz:**[_to the crowd_] We've all been here a hell of a lot longer than 
             she has!
    **Frasier:** That's right!
    
    _The staffers cheer again.  Behind Roz, Kate enters quietly from her
    office._
    
        **Roz:** She pushes us, we push back!
    
    _The staffers, noticing Kate, are conspicuously silent._
    
        **Roz:** She's standing right behind me, isn't she?
       **Kate:** Yeah.
    
    _Roz turns around to confront her, but like all the other staffers, 
    she suddenly becomes mute and cowed in Kate's presence._
    
       **Kate:** Is there a problem?  Nope?  Good.
    
    _She goes to leave.  The crowd parts to let her through.  Everyone is
    obviously terrified.  Except for..._
    
    **Frasier:** Kate?
       **Kate:**[_stops amidst the crowd_] Doc...?
    **Frasier:** Er, these people... would like to speak with you.
       **Kate:** No, I'm sorry, I can't talk right now, I've got a meeting.
             [_turns to leave_]
    **Frasier:** Well I-I'm sorry, excuse me?  I think your meeting can wait
             five minutes.  Now they're a little upset about your memo. 
             I think you should discuss it with them.
       **Kate:** Dr Crane... I wrote the memo, I signed the memo, I posted 
             the memo.  If I had anything more to say, I would have put 
             it... Anybody?
       **Noel:**[_puts up his hand_] In the memo?
       **Kate:** Bravo.
    
    _She leaves._
    
        **Roz:** Okay.  If she wants to play tough, we'll play tough back.  
             We still have a lot of power here.  Now we could go on 
             strike...
    
    _The staffers make noises of reluctance._
    
        **Roz:**[_annoyed at them_] Yes!
    **Frasier:** Look, look, you know er, I, I think you should listen to Roz.  
             Every year in exchange for your hard work you receive a five 
             percent raise.  Now, you've fulfilled your part of the 
             bargain; she has blithely changed the deal.
       **Noel:** In the 'hood, they call that "being dissed."
    **Frasier:** Yes, my streetwise friend. [_to the crowd_] You have a right 
             to stand up for yourselves.
        **Roz:** Okay.  We gonna do this?  Are we together?
       **Noel:** What's the point?  If we strike they'll just replace us.  
             They only care about the on-air people.
        **Roz:** Aaah, so we'll get their support!  Frasier just said he's on
             our side!
    
    _The staffers are happy to hear this._
    
    **Frasier:**[_unsure_] I did?  Well, well, yes I, I did, I did, yes.  But, 
             heh, my meagre endorsement is, is meaningless without the 
             support of the... other talent.
        **Roz:**[_gleeful_] Did you hear that?  Frasier's gonna get everyone 
             on our side!
    
    _The staffers cheer._
    
    **Frasier:** What? [_reluctant_] Er I, I'd love to, to help, but you know, 
             I'm already in hot water with that woman!  You can't ask me 
             to raise a mutiny against her!
    
    _Noel steps up to Frasier with a timely quote._
    
       **Noel:** "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the
             one."  James Tiberius Kirk, Captain, Starship Enterprise.
             [_does the Vulcan salute_]
    **Frasier:** Go away, you annoying little man.
    
    _He nudges Noel away and goes to leave._
    
        **Roz:**[_imploring_] Please?
    **Frasier:**[_thinks about it, then enthusiastic_] Oh alright, alright!  
             You organise your people, I'll talk to mine!
    
    _The staffers cheer and Noel shakes Frasier's hand.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **COULDN'T WE JUST
    STOP EATING GRAPES**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.
    What looks like a quiet party is in progress.  There are four guests 
    standing around, talking to each other and to Frasier.  Daphne is 
    offering people some food from a tray; Martin is arranging a similar 
    tray on the dining table; Eddie is sitting in The Armchair.  A fifth 
    guest - Bulldog - enters from the kitchen, clutching a beer.  He goes 
    to The Armchair._
    
    **Bulldog:**[_to Eddie_] Hey, beat it.
    
    _Eddie barks at him.  Bulldog barks back.  Eddie scrambles off The
    Armchair and scurries out of the room, scared._
    
    **Bulldog:**[_to Eddie_] Hey, if you can't run with The Bulldog, stay on
             the porch.
    
    _He settles into The Armchair.  The doorbell rings.  Frasier answers 
    it to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:**[_enters and gives a pen to Frasier_] Good evening, Frasier; 
             you left your Mont Blanc in my car, so I... [_sees the guests_] 
             Oh. [_icily_] I see cocktails.  Hors d'oeuvres.  Mingling.  If 
             I were the suspicious type, I'd say you were throwing a 
             party to which I was not invited.
    _Martin approaches, bearing a tray of sausages.  He offers it to Niles._
     **Martin:** Feel like a wiener, Niles?
      **Niles:** Indeed I do.
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] Niles, this is not a party; and dad, that is
             fourteen-dollar-a-pound andouille sausage.
     **Martin:** Wow.  Means Eddie ate about thirty bucks' worth.
    
    _Martin returns to the guests._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, these people are colleagues from the station.  We're
             here to discuss a labour dispute.
      **Niles:**[_assuaged_] Oh, well. [_to the guests_] Fight on, people!
             [_to Frasier_] You know, there is no greater friend to the 
             working man than my own Maris.
    **Frasier:** Mmm.
      **Niles:** Remember, when our stable boy Wakim's appendix burst?  She had 
             him driven back to the border at her own personal expense!
    _He leaves.  Frasier is just about to close the door when three other
    guests arrive.  One of them is the excruciatingly camp Gil Chesterton._
        **Gil:** Ah, good evening, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Gil, Sheryl, Floyd!
        **Gil:** Oh!  What a stunning apartment!
    **Frasier:** Well...
    
    _Gil strides around the room enthusiastically._
    
        **Gil:** The palette is pure, subtle elegance!  The detailing... well,
             it's inspired! [_examines a statuette_] And the furnishings... 
             [_sees The Armchair and stops in his tracks_] Oh, dear.  Is that 
             a chair?
    **Frasier:**[_trying to smile_] That is my father's chair.
        **Gil:** Oh.  Well... this must be your father!
    
    _He shakes hands with Martin._
    
     **Martin:** Hi - Marty Crane.  You put on quite a show!
        **Gil:**[_pleased_] Oh, you've heard my little programme?
     **Martin:** No, I mean just coming through the door.
    
    _He sits in The Armchair, which has been vacated by Bulldog._
    
    **Bulldog:**[_to Frasier_] Doc, doc!  Can we hurry this thing up?  I got a
             charity event tonight.  She's not much to look at, but what
             the hell.
    
    _Frasier addresses the assembled group of eight KACL personalities._
    
    **Frasier:** Okay, well, since we're all here... Er, now, regarding
             management's claim of financial distress, I've done some
             checking around, and I've found that the advertising 
             revenues are up eleven-and-a-half per cent...
    _He is interrupted by a starstruck squeal from Daphne, who has noticed
    Gil._
    
     **Daphne:** Gil Chesterton, the restaurant critic!
        **Gil:**[_takes and bites into a snack from Daphne's tray_] Yes.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I just love those wicked things you say when the food is
             bad!
        **Gil:**[_picks the snack out of his mouth in disgust_] Well, keep
             bringing these and you won't be disappointed!
    _As Frasier continues his speech, Daphne sits down at the dining table, 
    looking slightly pouty._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to the KACL personalities_] The wage freeze is unwarranted.
             It is simply a ploy of an overly ambitious station manager,
             [_angry_] and typical of this woman!  She has terrorised us, 
             she has tampered with our shows.  It's time we said no to
             this Princess of Darkness!
    **Bulldog:** I got a better idea.  Why don't we just walk up to Mike Tyson 
             and tell him he talks funny?
    **Frasier:**[_unamused_] What about our support staff?  If we don't back
             this strike, they may lose their jobs!  They're powerless
             without our support.
        **Gil:** Frasier, old man, why do they need raises?  You're talking
             about people who eat corn dogs and nachos.
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] That statement is appallingly elitist.
        **Gil:** Well thank you, Mister Everyday People!
    
    _The other KACL personalities snigger._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, I'm sure we'd all like to help these people, but we 
             need our jobs.  We're working stiffs too, living from 
             paycheck-to-paycheck just like they are.
    
    _Niles re-enters._
    
      **Niles:** Excuse me, someone's blocking me in downstairs.  Who has a 
             BMW?
    
    _Five out of the eight guests, including Gil and Bulldog, proudly put
    up their hands._
    
      **Niles:** A red BMW. [_Two hands are still up_] With a red interior.
        **Gil:** Oh, that's me!
    _He goes to Niles at the doorway.  Frasier shakes his head in 
    exasperation._
      **Niles:**[_to Gil_] Just give me your key; I'll leave it to the doorman.
        **Gil:**[_at the doorway_] Oh, no no.  I was just leaving.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, I'm going too. [_goes to leave_]
    **Frasier:**[_frustrated_] Well... where are your ethics?  Where's your
             conscience?
    **Bulldog:** Where's your john?  I need to slap on some Canoe.
    _The other KACL personalities file to the doorway.  Frasier, defeated,
    slumps onto the couch in despair._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, I'm with you people!  To heck with the workers.  
             They're not yours!
    **Bulldog:** Hey, damn right!
    
    _The other personalities, on their way out, agree._
    
     **Martin:** And chances are, after the station manager crushes the 
             little people, she won't come after you big shots.
    **Bulldog:** Right. [_slightly unsure_] Why would she...?
     **Martin:** Well, I mean er, supposing she's trying to save money, you're 
             the big ticket items.  Erm, after all this, well, she won't 
             have to worry about the support staff backing you guys up, 
             will she? [_laughs, half to himself_] Oh but no, that's crazy.
    
    _The assembled big shots pause to think about this._
    
        **Gil:**[_worried_] You're not suggesting that... Kate might be coming
             after our money next?
     **Martin:**[_to the personalities_] No, she wouldn't do that!  She's a
             peach, right?  Soft as a cream puff.
    **Frasier:**[_ominously sarcastic_] And we all know no-one here is 
             overpaid...
        **Gil:** Suddenly, I'm feeling very Norma Rae.
    _He shuts the door and, along with all of the other now uncomfortable-
    looking personalities, returns to the middle of the room.  Frasier,
    reinvigorated, gets up._
    
    **Frasier:** Great!  I'll get us some more wine. [_quietly to Martin_] 
             Dad, that was brilliant, using reverse psychology!  I guess 
             living with me is rubbing off on you a little bit.
    _Frasier heads towards the kitchen.  Martin gets up and follows him._
    
     **Martin:** Well, I guess it's only natural that environmental factors 
             would influence personality development...
    **Frasier:** Alright.
     **Martin:** Well, oh wait I, I hope I didn't hit some long-repressed 
             Oedipal nerve...
    **Frasier:** Very funny.
     **Martin:** Because the last thing we want is for you to be sublimating 
             your anger passive/aggressive...
    **Frasier:** Oh, alright!  Just stop it, you wise ass!
     **Martin:**[_pats Frasier on the back_] Ha-hey!  Looks like I'm rubbing
             off on you, too!
    
    _They enter the kitchen.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **THE BLOODLESS COUP**
    
    _Scene One - KACL
    In Roz's booth, various KACL staffers - including Roz and Noel -- 
    are quietly talking.  Frasier enters from the corridor._
    
    **Frasier:** Alright, people!  I have spoken with the on-air talent, and 
             I...
       **Noel:**[_interrupts_] Shhh!  Ixnay, Dr Crane...
    
    _He creeps over to the studio door and closes it._
    
    **Frasier:**[_mildly sarcastic_] Ah, yes.  You've really dropped the cone 
             of silence now.  Anyway, I have delivered on my promise: the 
             talent is behind you.  If you strike, we strike.  All for 
             one and one for all!
    
    _The staffers cheer._
    
    **Frasier:** Okay!  So who is our spokesperson - who is leading the 
             charge?
    _Noel steps forth in what he hopes is a heroic and intimidating manner._
       **Noel:** I am - you want to make something of it? [_to himself_] Oh 
             shoot, I smiled again! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Rozalinda, a word.
    
    _He gestures towards the studio and leaves for it; Roz follows him.  
    
    CUT TO: the studio as she enters and Frasier closes the door, 
    separating them from the staffers._
    
    **Frasier:** Our leader is Noel Shempsky?!  The man has all the backbone 
             of a paramecium!
        **Roz:** Well, do you think that it's _my_ idea?  Noel and I were the 
             only two who volunteered.  'Course, they voted me down.  I'm
             smarter than he is, more confident, more articulate, [_hot-
             headed_] but those stupid little WUSSES think I'm a HOT-HEAD!
    **Frasier:** But Noel, Roz!  A lot of people's jobs are riding on this -
             including mine!
        **Roz:** Then you do it!
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] Me?
        **Roz:** Yes!
    **Frasier:**[_very worried_] No no, me?
        **Roz:** Oh, please!
    **Frasier:**[_panicky_] Me?  No, no, I've done enough already, oh...
    
    _They are interrupted by an irritating knocking on the door of Roz's
    booth.  Frasier opens it._
    
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] What?
    _Noel enters with what he hopes is resolve.  Behind him, some staffers
    peep through the doorway._
    
       **Noel:** Dr Crane, I can see that you're concerned about my negotiating 
             skills.  But don't be - I have a secret weapon: I can faint at 
             will.  Check it out...
    _He collapses, hitting the floor with a loud bump, and he does not 
    get up.  Roz and the others stare at him; Frasier makes a decision._
    
    **Frasier:**[_to the staffers_] Okay people, there's been a coup.  I am now 
             your leader!
    
    _The staffers cheer._
    
    **Frasier:**[_points_] To the lair of the She-Wolf!
    
    _They leave via Roz's booth.  
    
    CUT TO: outside Kate's office as a militant crowd of staffers, now led 
    by a determined-looking Frasier, march in.  Kate enters from her office 
    and is slightly taken aback._
    
       **Kate:** Wow.  What have we here?
    **Frasier:** We are dissatisfied with the wage freeze and we demand to
             speak to you about it. [_to the crowd_] Don't we?
    
    _The crowd agrees._
    
       **Kate:** Alright, but aren't you people still on the clock?
    
    _The crowd agrees.  And leaves immediately, abandoning Frasier to a 
    bemused Kate._
    
       **Kate:** Well hi-ho the dairy-o, the cheese stands alone.
    **Frasier:**[_affecting unconcern_] They're a shrewd group.  They only flex 
             their muscles when they have to. [_shouts to the off-screen 
             staffers_] Well done!
       **Kate:**[_amused_] Yeah, right.  Will you get in here?
    _She enters her office and is followed by Frasier.  
    
    CUT TO: the office.
    Kate sits on the front of her desk as Frasier closes the door._
    
       **Kate:** I'm kinda surprised to see you here.  This really isn't your
             fight, is it?
    **Frasier:**[_proud_] I am honoured to have been chosen by my colleagues 
             to speak for them.
       **Kate:** Oh.  That's a shame.  I was kinda looking forward to seeing
             Shempsky faint.
    **Frasier:** Well, we have a lot to do, so we may as well just get to it... 
             [_gazes at Kate_] Is that a, a new hairdo?  It's very fetching.
       **Kate:**[_gazes at Frasier; mildly sarcastic_] Oooh, is that a new tie?  
             It just lights up your pretty face.
    **Frasier:**[_frustrated_] Look, what is it about us?  I mean, why all 
             this friction between us?  For my own part, your intolerable 
             smugness reminds me of my ex-wife.  But... what is the source
             of your antipathy toward me?  Was there some intimidating male 
             figure in your childhood?  A father?  A, a priest?  A 
             department store Santa... I don't know, I'm just spit-balling
             here!
       **Kate:** I have an idea about the source of our antagonism.
    **Frasier:**[_smug_] Good.  Do let me hear it.
    
    _He sits down in an armchair.  Kate stands up and leans over him._
    
       **Kate:** I'm a woman, I'm as smart as you, and I'm your boss.
    **Frasier:** Coincidences, all!
       **Kate:** Doc... I don't want to analyse your hang-ups.  I already got 
             a full-time job.  Let's just get down to business, okay?
    _She goes around to the other side of her desk and sits in her swivel 
    chair._
    **Frasier:** Oh, very well.  There's really very little to discuss.  
             These people were promised a raise.  They have fulfilled 
             their part of the bargain; it's time for you to honour 
             yours.  You have twenty-four hours.
       **Kate:** Or?
    **Frasier:** We walk, _en masse_.  Including the on-air talent.  I've seen
             to that myself.
       **Kate:** You have.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hm.
       **Kate:**[_suddenly fed-up_] Why are you gunning for me?
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] Gunning?  For you?  This isn't about you, it's about
             what you're doing to those people.  It's the shame of Seattle!
       **Kate:** No, no; this is about your ego, which is the SIZE of Seattle!  
             Every suggestion, every decision I've made has been met by 
             this impenetrable wall of arrogance masquerading as 
             righteousness.
    **Frasier:** Oh ho ho ho ho, that's a desperate shot - attacking me because 
             I have a social conscience!
       **Kate:** No, what you have is a fat contract, and so do the rest of 
             your cronies.  So when it came time for staff raises, there 
             was no more money left in the till!
    **Frasier:**[_incensed_] Oh, you are twisting things to make it look like
             it's my fault! [_stands up_] Oh, it's true what they say: the
             devil comes disguised as a beautiful woman!
    
    _Frasier and Kate are now in a stand-off over the desk.  Their
    altercation becomes increasingly passionate, in more ways than one._
    
       **Kate:**[_stands up too_] There would've been raises if you hadn't taken 
             all the money to pay for those Armani suits.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, what about you?  Let's not overlook that pricey little 
             Fendi scarf you're wearing!
       **Kate:** Well, what about this designer cologne on you?
    **Frasier:** Well, how about those pouty lips that must have cost you a
             fortune in collagen injections!
       **Kate:** These lips are mine, you arrogant gasbag!
    **Frasier:** You intractable despot!
       **Kate:** BLOWHARD!
    **Frasier:** TYRANT!!
       **Kate:** ASS!!!
    **Frasier:** SHREW!!!!
    _Suddenly they grab each other and kiss, violently.  Kate grabs the 
    lapels of Frasier's jacket and pushes him away._
    
       **Kate:**[_breathless_] Get out...!
    _But she pulls him close and they kiss, again.  Kate pushes Frasier away 
    once more._
    
       **Kate:**[_distraught_] _Now_!
    _Frasier rushes to the door, stops for a moment to glance back in 
    horror, and then leaves.  Kate slumps over her desk.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **I DRAW THE LINE
    AT BLANCHE DUBOIS**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.  
    Martin and Daphne are present.  The doorbell rings and Martin goes to 
    open the door; it is Niles, and he looks like a nervous wreck._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles!
      **Niles:**[_stumbles in_] Maris found a grey hair.
     **Martin:**[_closes the door_] Daphne, get Niles a brandy.
    
    _Daphne does so.  Niles sits down on the couch as Martin heads for 
    The Armchair._
    
      **Niles:** It was right at the apex of her widow's peak.
     **Martin:** Better bring the bottle! [_sits in The Armchair_]
      **Niles:** She blames me, dad.  She said it's from the stress I caused
             her last night when I thoughtlessly turned on the light 
             while she was getting undressed.
    _Daphne hands Niles a glass of brandy, along with the bottle, and sits
    next to him on the couch armrest.  Then, a worried-looking Frasier
    enters through the front door.  Daphne gets up and goes to him
    enthusiastically._
    
     **Daphne:**[_to Frasier_] Oh!  Good evening, Dr Crane!  Oh, let me take
             that for you. [_takes his coat and goes to hang it up_] After 
             all, you are the friend of the working man!
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Defender of the little people...
    **Frasier:** Alright, Daphne...
     **Daphne:**[_hanging Frasier's coat on the hook_] Standing up to the boss
             on behalf of the downtrodden, selflessly risking your own...
    **Frasier:**[_loses his temper_] Don't you have some meat to boil?
    
    _The others stare at him._
    
    **Frasier:**[_calms down_] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I apologise, it's just been 
             a, a, a bad day.  I was elected by the employees to present 
             our demands to, to Kate.
     **Daphne:** Oh well, that was a smart move!  Did you give her a good
             tongue-lashing?
    **Frasier:** In a manner of speaking, yes.
     **Martin:** I'm proud of you, son.
    **Frasier:** No, don't be, dad - I'm a fraud.
    
    _Daphne goes to the dining table and cleans it up._
    
    **Frasier:**[_depressed_] I, I was in her office... tempers flared and, the
             next thing I knew, we were...
    
    _Daphne leaves for the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:**...locked in a... passionate kiss!
    
    _Daphne returns, suddenly._
    
     **Daphne:**[_intrigued_] Ooooh, go on!
    **Frasier:**[_slightly embarrassed_] Daphne, I'm really not that comfortable 
             talking about this in front of you.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no need to be shy around me.  I'm a professional health 
             care worker!  I've seen it all!  I've helped your father in 
             and out of the bathtub.
     **Martin:** Okay, Daphne...
     **Daphne:** I've seen his bits!
     **Martin:**[_outraged_] Hey!  Oh, for God's sake! [_to Frasier_] Just tell
             her, will you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, alright.  It was like nothing I've ever experienced
             before, it was just... pure sex!  Overwhelming, unexpected,
             animal-like!
      **Niles:**[_sarcastic_] Oh well, that!  We've all experienced that, who
             hasn't?  Pfff!
     **Daphne:** I'm no stranger to that feeling meself. [_goes to the couch_]
             It can strike without warning.  And you don't know who it 
             will be! [_sits on the armrest again_] Why, you could be
             standing next to a person [_gestures towards Niles_] month
             after month, and then the next thing you know, you're
             tearing each other's clothes off!  There's a word for it...
      **Niles:**[_to himself_] Hope.
     **Daphne:** Hmmm?
    **Frasier:** Oh, this is madness!  I'm actually lusting after a woman 
             that does nothing but grate on my nerves.  I can't stand 
             her!
     **Daphne:** Oh really, Dr Crane!  Would a man want to have sex with a 
             woman he doesn't even like?
    
    _To her dismay, all of the males present answer to the positive._
    
    **Frasier:**[_thoughtful_] What about her?  Maybe she's been harbouring
             feelings for me.  Is it possible that she could have been
             lusting after me all this time?
     **Martin:** Oh, it could be.  But... you know, you were in the middle of
             a negotiation.  Maybe she laid that smackeroo on you just to
             rattle your brain.
      **Niles:** Dad has a point.  Your musk-drenched animal magnetism aside,
             it's quite possible that she was simply manipulating you.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I hardly think so. [_smiles_] The woman's passion...
             seemed genuine.
     **Daphne:**[_knowingly_] Yes - it always does. [_gets up and goes to the 
             dining table_]
    **Frasier:** Do you suppose it's possible she's just using sex to sway me
             to her side?
     **Martin:** Well, figure it out.  Who made the first move?  You or her?
    **Frasier:** There was no first move.  It was more like spontaneous
             sexual combustion.
     **Martin:** There's always a first move.  Think.
    **Frasier:** Alright.  I was standing in front of her desk like so. [_walks 
             up to the coffee table in front of Niles_] She was facing me...
             Niles, you be Kate.
      **Niles:**[_insulted_] I will not.
    **Frasier:** Look, just stand up!
      **Niles:**[_exasperated_] I'm always the girl!  In every prep school play 
             I was the girl!  Guinevere, Marian the Librarian, Ado Annie.  
             Well, no more, I'm through with it!  When do I get to be 
             Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo'?!
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] This is getting me nowhere! [_goes for his coat_] 
             Alright.  I'll just have to go down there and confront her 
             myself. [_grabs his coat and wears it, while walking to the 
             door_] Find out if what she was feeling was actually genuine
             or she was simply being a conniving femme fatale! 
     **Daphne:** Oh, come on now, Dr Crane!  It's not like men have never 
             used sex to get what they want.
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] How can we possibly USE sex to get what we want?!  
             Sex IS what we want!
    _He exits, leaving the two remaining males nodding their heads and the
    female even more dismayed.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    _Scene Three - KACL; Kate's office.  
    Kate is alone behind her desk, facing away from the door and looking 
    through some papers.  Her jacket is off and her bare arms are now 
    visible.
    
    Someone knocks on the door; it is Frasier, and he peeps in timidly.  
    Kate glances at him, nervous.  She slowly turns to face him as he 
    creeps into the room and quietly closes the door.  
    
    At the beginning their conversation is conducted awkwardly and from 
    opposite ends of the room._
    
    **Frasier:** Kate.
       **Kate:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Er... I think we have some issues to discuss.
       **Kate:** Me too.  Have a seat.
    **Frasier:** I'd prefer to stand.
       **Kate:** Me too.
    **Frasier:** Let's talk about the kiss.
       **Kate:** Yeah.  Let's.
    **Frasier:** Alright.  Why did it happen?  Some possibilities: [_sidles up 
             to the desk_] Er, frustration; passion; the stress of the
             situation; [_pauses meaningfully_] Manipulation.
       **Kate:**[_intrigued_] Manipulation... that is interesting.
    **Frasier:** What's interesting is that you focused on manipulation.  
             Why...?
       **Kate:** Because there's a possibility of manipulation.
    **Frasier:**[_triumphant_] So, you admit that you were manipulating me!
       **Kate:** Me?  I'm talking about you!  How dare you think I'd do a 
             thing like that!
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not unheard of for a woman like you to use her
             feminine wiles to get what she wants.
       **Kate:** Oh, very clever!  What about you using your masculine wiles
             to get what you want?
    
    _Frasier, surprised, thinks about this._
    
    **Frasier:**[_quietly_] You think my wiles are masculine?
       **Kate:** No, I am not going down that road again.
    **Frasier:**[_smug_] 'Course you're not.  Because at the end of that road
             is a cul-de-sac of vulnerability.  That's not you, is it?  
             No, you're cement-hard.
       **Kate:**[_incredulous_] "Cul-de-sac of vulnerability"? [_fed-up_] 
             Alright, listen.  You see me for a couple of hours out of
             every day, and you think you know me?  The _me_ me?  Alright,
             I can be tough - okay, I've gotta be.  I can also be tender...
             spontaneous... shy... lusty... playful.
    **Frasier:**[_turned on_] Kittenish?
       **Kate:** I could climb _you_ like a scratching post.
    **Frasier/Kate:**[_excited, then:_] Damn it!
    
    _It's kissing time again.  Kate leaps onto her desk and kneels upon 
    it, snogging Frasier.  Now it is Frasier's turn to disengage._
    
    **Frasier:**[_distraught_] Stop!  What are we doing?! [_goes to the door_]
             Now... there are people out there counting on us!
    
    _Kate moves off her desk and stands in front of it, rearranging her
    clothing._
    
       **Kate:** Right, you're absolutely right.  We've gotta put personal
             pleasure aside until we get this thing resolved.
    **Frasier:**[_determined_] Absolutely.  We owe it to them.  If it takes 
             every minute of every hour of every day, and every ounce of
             strength we have, we have got to settle this strike! [_claps 
             his hands together_] Alright.  Those people deserve a five 
             percent raise.
       **Kate:** I'll give you three.
    **Frasier:** Four!
       **Kate:** Done.
    
    _They kiss.  Embracing each other, they stumble up against the desk;
    Frasier sweeps some items off and they fall on top of it, still
    kissing.  
    
    CUT TO: outside at the same time.  Plenty of KACL staffers and 
    personalities, among them Gil and Noel, are standing around,
    waiting anxiously; Roz has her ear to the door of Kate's office.  
    Bulldog enters from the corridor._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, any news?
        **Roz:**[_takes her ear away, pleased_] Frasier's hanging tough!  He 
             just keeps pounding that desk and saying, "More, more, more!"
    **Bulldog:** Okay!
    _The staffers cheer.  The door to Kate's office opens just a crack and
    Frasier slips out, looking furtive and somewhat dishevelled.  He closes 
    the door and keeps his back to it while addressing the crowd._
    
    **Frasier:** Good news - she's offered three percent.
    
    _Everyone agrees to take it._
    
    **Frasier:** No, never!  I'm going to get you four!  I don't care if I 
             have to stay in there all night!
    
    _He goes back in.  The assembled staffers and personalities cheer him
    on and, led by Gil, chant his name: "FRASIER, FRASIER, FRASIER!"_
    
    **TO BE CONTINUED...**
    _END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    KACL; Kate's office.  Noel is standing in front of the desk and
    gesticulating at a seated Kate.  He dumps a piece of paper in front 
    of her and points at it peremptorily; she signs it, terrified and
    submissive.  He does a bit of heroic posing before leaving in 
    triumph.  
    
    Cut to outside.  Noel the Master Negotiator presents the paper to a 
    reception of adoring staffers, and gets a dramatic hug and kiss from 
    a very adoring Roz.  
    
    Then cut to Noel waking up at his office desk - oh no, it was all a 
    dream!  There is no-one around.  Noel, disappointed with reality, 
    decides to go back to sleep.
