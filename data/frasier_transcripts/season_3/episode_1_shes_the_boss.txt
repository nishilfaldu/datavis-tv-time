    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Apartment
    Daphne is eating breakfast at the table.  The door opens and she 
    hears two dogs barking at each other.  Martin drags Eddie through 
    the door._
    
     **Martin:** Come on in!  Come on, it's all over!  He won't mess with you! 
             [_closes door; to Eddie_] Are you nuts?  That was a Doberman!
     **Daphne:** Oh dear, what happened?
     **Martin:** Oh, get the first aid kit.  Eddie got into a fight.  We were 
             on the elevator with that Doberman from upstairs.  Eddie took 
             a perfectly innocent sniff, and wham!
    _Daphne brings the first aid kit from the powder room.  
    Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Morning, all.  What's all this?
     **Daphne:** Eddie was viciously attacked.
    **Frasier:** Oh. [_then_] Is that coffee cake I smell?
     **Martin:** Well, now that I look at it, it's just a scratch.  But I 
             probably should take him to the vet's anyway. 
     **Daphne:** What are you doing up so early?
    **Frasier:** Oh, the new station manager's taking over today.  She wanted 
             to meet with all of us.
     **Martin:** "She?"  Oh, working for a woman, huh?
    **Frasier:** Yes, why?
     **Martin:** Well, it's tough on guys, taking orders from a woman.  
             We resent it!
    **Frasier:** That's absurd.  If I had trouble taking orders from a woman, 
             Frederick would never have been conceived!
    
    _Doorbell._
    
     **Daphne:** My brothers couldn't stand taking orders from me.  I was 
             forever telling them, "Billy, clean your room," "Reginald, 
             get your elbow out of the gravy," "Nigel, take that thing 
             back to the hospital, the whole house is full of flies!"
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Morning, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.  Dad, Daphne.  Uh, I can't stay, I just 
             wanted to ask a favor.  Dad, can I borrow your gun?
     **Martin:** Maris taking singing lessons again?
      **Niles:** No.  Our home security system is down for repairs, and with 
             no electric gates I'll just feel safer if I'm packing heat.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles, you don't even know how to 
             pack a lunch.
      **Niles:** Dad, please.  Maris is a wreck ever since she found out our 
             entire neighborhood watch is wintering in Palm Beach.
     **Martin:** Forget it, you don't know the first thing about guns.
      **Niles:** Dad, please.
     **Martin:** No!  I don't believe in civilians having guns.
      **Niles:** This isn't fair!  Maris's mother gave her a gun!
     **Martin:**[_getting up_] Well, then Maris's mother can clean the mess up 
             after she accidentally blows your brains out.
      **Niles:**[_following him to the kitchen_] Dad, now you're talking 
             nonsense.  Maris's mother has never cleaned anything in 
             her life.
    _FADE OUT_
    **CRASS APPEAL**
    
    _Scene Two -- KACL
    Frasier, Gil, and Bulldog are sitting in the hall outside the 
    manager's office.  Roz comes in._
    
        **Roz:** All right, all right, listen up everyone, I've been working 
             the office grapevine, I've got the scoop on the new boss.
        **Gil:** Is she going to fire me?
    **Bulldog:** Hey, first things first! [_to Roz_] Is she baggable?
        **Roz:** Forget it, Bulldog, she'd have you for breakfast.
    **Bulldog:** Right, like I ever stick around that long.
        **Roz:** Anyway, the word is that she's like this psycho perfectionist.  
             Everyone at her last station was scared to death of her.  
             She's kind of becoming my idol.
    **Bulldog:** Hey, what if she hates sports?  I need this job.  I just 
             promised my mom a new pacemaker.  Wait, think I could get 
             her to believe I said "pasta maker?"
    **Frasier:** Now, look, there's no reason for us to give in to our 
             insecurities.  We all do good, solid shows.  We hardly 
             even know this woman, and already we're painting her as 
             a heartless Medusa!
    
    _Father Mike comes out of Kate's office, stunned._
    
       **Mike:** She said my ratings are down.  She said I'm not "hip."
    **Frasier:** Father Mike, are you all right?
       **Mike:** The little thug fired me!
    **Frasier:** I'm so sorry.
        **Gil:** Did she say anything else?
       **Mike:** She said, "Send in Frasier."
    
    _Frasier looks panicked.  Roz puts a hand over her face._
    
    _CUT TO: Manager's Office
    Kate Costas, the new station manager, is still moving into her office.  
    Boxes sit under empty shelves.  She's talking on the phone._
    
       **Kate:** Listen, tell the movers I want the couch directly in front of 
             the bookcase. [_Frasier comes in._] Uh-huh. [_to him_] Oh, have a 
             seat.
    
    _Frasier sits in a chair in front of the desk._
    
       **Kate:**[_into phone_] Uh-huh.  Yeah, yes.  No, not there!  In front of 
             the bookcase!
    _Frasier gets up, moves the chair to a bookcase in the far corner, 
    and sits down._
    
       **Kate:** Yes, tell her I got somebody here!  Could we move the 
             furniture later?
    _Frasier gets up, moves the chair back to its original place, and sits._
       **Kate:** Could we do that? [_hangs up_] Dr. Frasier Crane!  Kate Costas.
    **Frasier:**[_shaking hands_] Kate, what a pleasure.
       **Kate:** Likewise.  I've been listening to the tapes of all your shows.  
             I love what you're doing.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, thank you very much!  I like to think of my 
             show as a haven for the tempest-tossed in the maelstrom of 
             everyday life.
       **Kate:** Wow.  You really talk that way.  Anyway, your ratings are 
             very good.  But I still think we can do better.  Any ideas?
    
    _She goes to a bookcase and starts unpacking a box._
    
    **Frasier:** How to improve my show?  That is a tall order.  Uh... oh, 
             wait, you know, I was thinking of playing classical music 
             before my intros.  Let's say, perhaps, uh, Bartok's Concerto 
             for Orchestra in D Minor.
       **Kate:** It's too highbrow.  I mean, I love classical music, but to 
             most people it's a big snore.  Oh, incidentally, Bartok's 
             Concerto is in C.
    **Frasier:** Are you sure?
       **Kate:** Positive.  I put myself through college working at a classical 
             station.  Let's talk about advertising.  You've got a great 
             face.  I want to see it on t-shirts, I want to see it on park 
             benches, I even want to see it on Frisbees.  Everybody in 
             Seattle should be popping it, wearing it, sitting on it!
    **Frasier:** Wonderful.  You know, I hate to nitpick, but I was certain 
             that concerto's in D.  I was a music minor at Harvard.
       **Kate:** It's in C.  It was commissioned by Serge Kosivinsky in 1943 
             for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and since then it's been 
             recorded over thirty times--each time, in C.
    
    _She gives him a "Checkmate" smile._
    
       **Kate:** Also, I think you should start doing theme shows.  Devote a 
             whole show to people having extramarital affairs, or devote 
             a whole show to people with aberrant sexual practices.  
             Could you give me a hand with that box over there?
    **Frasier:** Of course. [_lifts it onto her desk and starts handing her 
             things from it_] Uh, Kate, you know, that advertising thing.  
             It's a very good idea.  But that-these theme shows, uh, it's 
             a less good idea.  You might even say a worse idea.
       **Kate:** Why is that?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, I am a doctor, and I'd hate to have the serious 
             work I do be tainted by commercialism.
       **Kate:** But you don't mind the Frisbees.
    **Frasier:**[_hands her a "Golden Microphone" award_] Well, I don't want 
             to be entirely uncooperative. [_hands her another_] It's just 
             that, well, you know, I've been in the radio game for some 
             time now, [_a third_] and I think I've learned enough about 
             broadcasting, as they say, [_a fourth_] to know what it is 
             that makes my show [_a fifth_] a good show. [_lifts the last 
             one_] My God, you've won six Golden Mike awards?
       **Kate:** Aren't you sweet to notice.  Finally, I would like you to 
             start giving priority to the juicier calls.
    **Frasier:** That's called pandering!
       **Kate:**[_lifting out a_] And that is called a Peabody Award!
    **Frasier:** Well, what exactly do you expect me to do?  Say to a caller, 
             "Listen, Bob, I'm sorry you lost your job, but unemployment's 
             a snore!  Why don't you go sleep with your best friend's wife 
             and call in on Monday when it'll be Infidelity Day on the 
             Frasier Crane Show!"
       **Kate:** I really know what I'm doing here.  The psychiatrists at my 
             last station went national.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I'd rather stay local if going national 
             means sucking at the sump-pump of sensationalism!
       **Kate:** Well, I'm the boss, Doc.  So, pucker up!
    **Frasier:** Listen, lady, I'm not changing my show.  Unless you're willing 
             to explain to the owners why you fired one of your highest-
             rated hosts, well then there's nothing you can do about it, 
             is there?
    
    _Kate smiles at him.
    
    SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Radio Booth
    Frasier is doing his show with Roz.  The lights in the hallway are off.
    _
    
    **Frasier:** Well, we're coming up on 3 A.M.
    
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **A LONG NIGHT'S JOURNEY INTO DAY**
    
    _Scene Four -- KACL
    Frasier is finishing his show._
    
      **Keith:**[_v.o._] I got to disagree with your last two callers.  I'm in 
             the same line of work, and I think that what we do is very 
             important!  People depend on us! [_bell dings_] I got to go, 
             Doc, it's time to powder the jelly donuts. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Well, I hate to cut short this enthralling symposium, but 
             perhaps we could hear from some non-bakers for a change?
        **Roz:** Wrap it up, will you?  We're finally done.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank God.  Stay tuned for the news, weather, and sports.  
             This is Dr. Frasier Crane, yadda-yadda-yadda, bye.
    
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes into his booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Really stunk up the airwaves with that one, didn't we?
        **Roz:** Frasier, I want you to flash forward to tonight.  It's 
             sometime after midnight.  Dennis Abbott and I have just 
             had a glorious meal at Le Ralee.  Dennis has just asked 
             me back to his penthouse apartment to see his priceless 
             collection of silk sheets.  And I lean forward and 
             whisper, [_throaty whisper_] "I can't.  I have to go to 
             work in an hour."  What is wrong with this picture?!
    **Frasier:** Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee.  It's a two-week wait.
        **Roz:** So is Dennis Abbott!  Frasier, we have got to get our old 
             time slot back!
    **Frasier:** Don't worry, Roz, we will she just moved us to break our 
             spirit.
        **Roz:** Well, she can saddle me up and ride me around the coffee 
             room!  I can't do this again!
    
    _They leave the booth.  Kate is waiting in the hallway._
    
       **Kate:** Good morning.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello.
       **Kate:** Enjoying your new time slot?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I found it invigorating!  Didn't you, 
             Roz?  Remember that woman who called in, uh, you know, with 
             the delusions of grandeur?  Couldn't understand why nobody 
             liked her.
       **Kate:** Well, I hope you explained to her that it's not important 
             that people like her, as long as they respect her.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, respect is important.  So is self-respect.
       **Kate:** Oh, yes, yes, but some people -- and this is so 
             unfortunate -- can't tell the difference between self-respect 
             and pig-headedness.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but those people are usually rigid little demagogues 
             who don't know the difference between the kind of respect 
             that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective 
             ...of what others expect.
       **Kate:** Isn't it sad when bad things happen to good sentences?
    **Frasier:** I think I made myself clear.
       **Kate:** Well, I really do have work to do.  I've got to find
             somebody for your old time slot -- now that it's free.
    **Frasier:** Good luck!
     
    _Kate leaves._
     
        **Roz:** Nice going, Frasier, now she's never gonna give in.
    **Frasier:** Steady, Roz.  She may have been able to intimidate people in 
             other situations, but here at KACL she'll find that we are 
             not a bunch of spineless twits!
    
    _Bulldog sticks his head out of a door._
    
    **Bulldog:**[_whispering_] Hey!  Is she gone?
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Apartment
    Martin and Daphne are eating breakfast._
    
     **Martin:** You don't want this bacon, I'm giving it to Eddie.
     **Daphne:** You know that bacon's not good for him.
     **Martin:** Eddie!  Hey, Eddie!  Come here, boy!
    _Eddie runs in.  He's wearing a plastic cone on his neck that encircles 
    his entire head.  Martin feeds him a rasher of bacon._
    
     **Martin:** And can't we take that stupid thing off him?
     **Daphne:** No!  The vet said if he scratches the scabs, they'll never 
             heal.  And I have noticed that if you sit him next to the 
             telly, Channel Five comes in a lot clearer.
     **Martin:** Look at him, he's humiliated!
    
    _From the apartment above, a dog barks._
    
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well, it doesn't help that that bully upstairs keeps         
             rubbing it in.
    
    _Eddie barks toward the ceiling._
    
     **Martin:** You tell him, boy!
    
    _Frasier comes out of his room in his dressing gown._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, I am trying to get some sleep!  I asked 
             you to keep that dog quiet, and instead you outfit him with 
             a megaphone!  In the last thirty-six hours I haven't had so 
             much as a nap, and I've got to be back at the station by 2 
             A.M. [_stares at Eddie_] Eddie, listen carefully.  By the time 
             this day is up, one of us is going to sleep.
    
    _Eddie ducks his head._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't worry, Dr. Crane, I'll take Eddie for a walk.  And 
             as far as your problem at work goes, if you want my opinion--
    **Frasier:** DON'T!  I've had my share of women's opinions for the week, 
             between the station's new Reichschancellor and Roz's incessant 
             whining!  As far as I'm concerned, your entire sex can put a 
             sock in it!
    
    _He goes back to his room._
    
     **Martin:** Boy, you'd never let me get away with a comment like that.
     **Daphne:**[_gets up and goes to the door_] Oh, even the best of us can 
             get a bit cranky when we're overtired.  All Dr. Crane needs 
             right now is a little peace and quiet.  Eddie?
    
    _She sticks two fingers in her mouth and blasts a shrill whistle._
    
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] Damn it!
    _Daphne opens the door and runs into Niles, who looks weirdly 
    overconfident._
    
      **Niles:** Morning, Daphne.  Where are you off to?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm taking Eddie for a walk.
      **Niles:** By yourself?
     **Daphne:** Yes, of course.  Why not?
      **Niles:** It's dangerous out there.  You never know when you might 
             need... [_pulls a small revolver from his briefcase_] one 
             of these.
     **Daphne:** A starter's pistol?  Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane.  
             But thanks for the thought.
    
    _She goes into the hall, laughing._
    
      **Niles:** How did she know it wasn't a real gun?  It fooled the 
             servants, even the ones who spent years fleeing _juntas._
     **Martin:** You bought a starter's pistol?
      **Niles:**[_gesturing with the gun_] Yes, you see, as long as Maris thinks 
             it's real, it makes her feel secure, but this way no one can 
             get hurt.
    _As if to punctuate the word "hurt," he accidentally pulls the trigger, 
    firing a blank shot that sends him hopping up onto the couch like a 
    frightened cat.  Even Martin is shaken.  Frasier rushes in._
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell was that?!  Was that a gunshot?!
      **Niles:** Morning, Frasier.  Just getting up?
    **Frasier:** "Just getting up?!"  Are you out of your mind?!  A gun just 
             went off in here!
     **Martin:** Niles bought a starter's pistol.
      **Niles:** And there's no need to get snippy.  Accidents happen, you 
             know.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy?  I didn't realize it was too 
             much to ask that there not be GUNPLAY IN MY LIVING ROOM!
     **Martin:** You know, Niles, you shouldn't have any kind of gun, really.  
             Come to think of it, now that Mr. Sunshine's home during the 
             day, maybe I shouldn't either!
    **Frasier:** Just relax.  It won't be long before my loyal fans protest, 
             and the afternoon slot is once again home to the compassionate 
             and lovable Dr. Frasier Crane. [_opens the front door_] Now get 
             the hell out, both of you!
     **Martin:** All right, maybe I can catch up to Daphne in the park.
      **Niles:** I'll cover you.
    
    _Martin and Niles go out the door.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- KACL
    Frasier, wearing a grimy sweatsuit, is in his chair.  A cup-holder 
    with four cups of coffee sits next to him.  Behind him, Roz, wearing 
    a slinky evening dress, takes one._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  I'll be taking 
             your calls for the next four hours.  Roz, who's on the line?
        **Roz:** How should I know?  I just got here.
    
    _Frasier pushes the button himself._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Line Two, you're on with Dr. Frasier Crane.
       **Mark:**[_v.o._] Uh, hey, Dr. Crane.  It's Mark.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Mark.  I'm listening.
       **Mark:** OK.  Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, 
             um, I've been watching myself on the video camera, and 
             the camera-me is doing things I don't approve of.
    _Frasier puts a hand on his face.  Roz listlessly goes into her booth.
    
    DISSOLVE TO: Later
    Frasier and Roz are both fast asleep in their chairs.  A woman 
    (Phyllis) is on the line._
    
    **Phyllis:**[_v.o._] People think insomnia is a laughing matter, but it's 
             hell.  If I don't get some sleep soon, I'll just--I'll go 
             crazy!  You've got to help me, Dr. Crane?  Dr. Crane?  Hey, 
             I'm talking here!
    
    _Frasier and Roz wake up._
    
    **Frasier:** What?!  I'm listening.
    **Phyllis:** So what do you think I should do?
    
    _Frasier looks at Roz.  She's shrugs to say she's stumped.  He 
    decides to wing it._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, sometimes these things seem clearer in the 
             light of day.  My advice is to sleep on it.
    **Phyllis:** Is that some kind of a joke?!  To make fun of the 
             insomniac?!
    **Frasier:** Oh, no--
    _She hangs up.  Frasier sighs.  Roz signals him to go to commercial._
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, and now for a word from, um, uh, ah, [_shuffles some 
             papers on his console_] I forget, I think they sell paint.
    
    _He goes to commercial.  Roz comes into the booth._
    
        **Roz:** You hear that whooshing sound?  It's my career going down 
             the toilet.
    **Frasier:** Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped a single person 
             tonight.
        **Roz:** Helped?  You'll be lucky if you don't get sued!  You told a 
             longshoreman to come out of the closet, and a gay guy to 
             spend more time on the docks!
    **Frasier:** Well, you're the one who's supposed to keep track of who's 
             on what line!
        **Roz:**[_losing it_] OK, let me make it easy for you: freaks!  Freaks 
             on Line One!  Freaks on Line Two!  Freaks, everywhere!
    **Frasier:**[_grabbing her_] Roz, Roz, Roz!  We shouldn't get mad at each 
             other.  Oh God, this is all Kate's fault.
        **Roz:** You're right, you're right, she's ruining us!  And there's           
             nothing we can do.
    **Frasier:** Yes, there is!  If we're gonna go down, we're gonna take her 
             down with us!  We've got one hour left.  If she wants raunch, 
             we're gonna give her more raunch than she ever dreamed of!  
             Are you with me, Roz?
        **Roz:** Just pump up the volume and call me Kitty!
    **Frasier:** OK!
    _Roz goes back into her booth and grabs some SFX carts.  Frasier goes 
    back on and speaks in a raucous shock-DJ voice._
    
    **Frasier:** We're back, Seattle.  And in accordance with new station 
             policy, we are going to be pandering to the lowest human 
             instinct.  In other words, who wants to talk about SEX?!  
             Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex!
    
    _Roz plays a cart.  There is the sound of a whip cracking._
    
    **Frasier:** YEAH!  I want to know who's having sex!  How you're having 
             it!  I want to know if you're having it right now!
        **Roz:** Look, Dr. Crane, the lines are hot! [_sultry voice_] Really _hot!_
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Kitty. [_punches button_] Hello, Caller.  What are 
             you wearing?
      **Nancy:**[_v.o._] Nothing.  I'm naked.
    **Frasier:** Hey, that's a great idea!  Let's all get naked!  Hey, I'm 
             getting naked right now!
    
    _He reaches down and pulls off his shoes._
    
        **Roz:** While Dr. Crane strips, our new station manager would like to 
             know if you prefer to be the spanker, or the spankee.
      **Nancy:** Oh, definitely the spanker.
    
    _In his booth, Frasier is stripped down to his underwear._
    
    **Frasier:** Well then, hop in a cab!  I'm not wearing any pants!
    
    _Roz whoops as Frasier twirls his pants over his head.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING**
    
    _Scene Five -- Kate's Office
    Frasier, still wearing his sweatsuit, is sitting in Kate's office.  
    She leans against her desk, listening to a tape of Frasier's 
    performance._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on tape_] While Roz laces up her leather bustier, this is 
             Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL - all talk, all night, all naked!
    
    _Frasier looks a little sheepish.  Kate stops the tape._
    
       **Kate:** Explain.
    **Frasier:** As George Bernard Shaw once said, "there are two tragedies 
             in life.  One is not getting what we want, and the other is 
             getting it."
       **Kate:** You know full well this is not what I wanted!  You did this 
             to vex me.  And you succeeded.  And it was not Shaw, it was 
             Oscar Wilde.  Did you ever open a book at Harvard?
    **Frasier:** You know, one of these days, you're going to misquote someone, 
             and I'm going to land on you like a sumo wrestler!
       **Kate:** All I wanted, all I wanted was a lousy little theme show 
             once or twice a week!
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah!  "Frasier Crane takes a leering look at infidelity!"
       **Kate:** No, not a leering look!  Just a good look.  At the pain of 
             infidelity, at what it does to families, at what it does to 
             children, at what it does to the fabric of society, and this 
             is just off the top of my head.  But, no!  You are such an 
             arrogant gasbag, so used to being cock-of-the-walk around here 
             that you can't stand still for one minute and listen to 
             a perfectly valid suggestion from somebody else!
    **Frasier:**[_blood up_] And you are such a smug egomaniac that your entire 
             self-image would shatter like a cheap mirror if you ever had 
             to admit that you had made a mistake!
    
    _Kate's jaw drops._
    
    **Frasier:** You are a classic case of neurotic narcissism, and a first-
             class SMARTY-PANTS! [_pause_] You can go ahead and fire me now.
       **Kate:**[_sits back down_] Yes, I could do that, yeah.  But I'm not 
             going to.
    **Frasier:** Did you listen to the whole tape?
       **Kate:** Oh, yeah.  But, unlike you, I put what's good for the station 
             above my personal feelings.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's-that's awfully big of you. [_sits back down_] Guess 
             that means I'll be moving back to my old time slot.
       **Kate:** Guess again, Captain Midnight!  If I give you back your old 
             time slot without your making a single concession to me, 
             that would completely undermine my authority.  Being a crack 
             shrink, surely that's within your grasp.
    **Frasier:**[_stands and leans over her desk_] Grasp this: if I don't get my 
             old time slot, I quit!
       **Kate:**[_stands face-to-face with him_] Grasp this: you do, and I'll 
             sue you for breach of contract!
    **Frasier:** OK, then it's a stalemate!  If we don't want to remain 
             entrenched in these positions forever, one of us had better 
             think of something!
       **Kate:** Yes, one of us better.
    _They sit down again.  There is silence as they both ponder as hard as 
    they can._
    
    **Frasier:** I've got it!
       **Kate:**[_hits her chair arm_] Damn!
    
    _CUT TO: Outside Kate's office. 
    Gil and Bulldog walk to the door._
    
    **Bulldog:** So, we're together, right?
        **Gil:** Absolutely.
    **Bulldog:** We're not letting her push us around any longer!
        **Gil:** Nope.  You do the talking.  I'll stand behind you and burn 
             holes through her with my "You call this a Hollandaise 
             sauce?!" glare.
    
    _Frasier storms out of the office, Kate following him._
    
    **Frasier:** I don't care what you say, I like theme shows!  And I'm going 
             to do them, starting this Friday with "Frasier Crane takes a 
             look at the consequences of infidelity!"
       **Kate:** You do, and I'll make you start that show with classical 
             music!  Bartok's Concerto in C, I don't care how much you 
             hate it!
    **Frasier:** Damn you!
       **Kate:** It's my way, or no way.
    **Frasier:**[_crushed_] You win.  Bartok it is.
    
    _He leaves the hallway._
    
       **Kate:** What do you two want?
    **Bulldog:** Nothing.
        **Gil:** Keep up the good work.
    _They leave.  Kate smooths her jacket and smiles, authority restored._
    **Credits:**
    Frasier's Apartment
    Martin hits the television, trying to restore the picture.  Daphne 
    picks up Eddie, still in his cone, and places him on top of the TV in 
    a sitting position.  Martin watches the picture, telling her how to 
    adjust Eddie for best reception._
