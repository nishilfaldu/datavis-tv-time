    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin is reading the newspaper as Daphne is wandering about the 
    living room when the doorbell sounds.  She shouts "coming" then 
    opens the door to find Niles on his mobile phone._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:**[_into phone:_] My God, after all our years together - all the 
             good times, all the bad times - you can't loan me a meager 
             four thousand dollars?  You must appreciate how hard it is 
             for me to approach you about this.  I thought I meant more 
             to you than this, but apparently I don't. [_hangs up_] And 
             they call themselves "the friendly bank!"
    
    _Daphne goes back to the table to clip coupons._
    
     **Martin:** What do you need to borrow money for? 
      **Niles:** I saw the most exquisite Biedermeier footstool.
     **Martin:** For four thousand bucks?  Niles, your mother and I didn't 
             pay that much for our first house.
      **Niles:** I know, dad.  I lived there.
     **Martin:** Well, I keep telling you, you don't have Maris's money to 
             throw around anymore.  You're going to have to start cutting 
             back a little.
      **Niles:** I have cut back.  Last month I told my masseur I could only 
             see him once a week.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic:_] Oh, I remember that scene in "Grapes Of Wrath" 
             when Ma Joad did that.
     **Daphne:** You know, if you need to save a bit, you should do what I do 
             and cut out coupons.
      **Niles:**[_interested:_] Coupons.  Well, what a wonderful way 
             to economize.  Well, I could clip them and give them 
             to my personal shopper. 
    
    _Daphne and Martin share a look.  Frasier enters from his room._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, good morning.
      **Niles:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, has Bebe Glazer called back yet?
     **Daphne:** 'Fraid not.
      **Niles:** You're still consorting with that barracuda?
    **Frasier:** Well, a barracuda is what you want in an agent, Niles.  
             It's just that the station's been sold, I was hoping 
             she might have some scuttlebutt on the new owner. 
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** I must admit she's rather hard to get a hold of these days.
      **Niles:** Oh, really?  I thought one just drew a pentagram on the 
             floor and chanted "I summon thee" three times.
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Roz, who is carrying a file of news 
    clippings._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey.
    
    _They all shout their greetings._
    
    **Frasier:** What have you got on the new owner?
        **Roz:** Oh, plenty.
    **Frasier:** Yeah?
        **Roz:** His name is Wilford S. Boone, but he likes to be called 
             "Big Willy."
     **Daphne:** Well, there's a little snapshot of his psyche right there.
        **Roz:** He's an eighty-five year-old Texan.  Practically no formal 
             education but he went from errand boy at a radio station to 
             owning his own media empire worth six hundred million.
      **Niles:**[_distracted by coupon:_] This is great, I don't even know 
             what "Renuzit" is, but it's twenty cents off and I want it.
        **Roz:** You're clipping coupons?
      **Niles:**[_proudly_] I'm economizing.
        **Roz:** Oh well it's about time, you spend money like a drunken 
             sailor.
      **Niles:** She said authoritatively.
    
    _Frasier is looking through the papers at the coffee table._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, could we get back to the subject at hand, please?
     **Martin:** What are you so antsy about?
    **Frasier:** Dad, Wilford S. Boone-
        **Roz:** Big Willy.
    **Frasier:** Please, Roz, I just can't say that yet, alright? - Wilford S. 
             Boone owns thirty radio stations across the country.  If he 
             likes you he's been known to syndicate your show nationwide. 
             So, I'm trying to find out if we have anything in common - 
             an angle, if you will.  So what are his interests, Roz?
        **Roz:** Well, it's all in there.  He likes whittling, rodeos, the 
             novels of Zane Grey...
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic:_] Gee, Fras.  It's like you two were separated 
             at birth.
        **Roz:** He also owns a 5,000 acre cattle ranch and the world's 
             largest collection of antique six-shooters.
    **Frasier:** Oh dear God, I'm sucking up to Yosemite Sam!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Radio Station.
    Roz and Frasier are walking along the corridors towards the recording 
    booth._
    
        **Roz:** I think if we really want to impress Big Willy we should 
             think of some Western theme to do for the show today.
    **Frasier:** Great idea, Roz. [_sarcastic:_] Why don't we just start the 
             show off with a segment on how to get in touch with your 
             inner young'un.
    
    _Frasier and Roz bump into Bulldog who is listening to Gil's show 
    through the door._
    
        **Gil:**[_in booth_] What a fascinating theory!  Do go on.
    **Frasier:** What's going on?
    **Bulldog:** Oh, this is great.  I told Gil the new station owner is a 
             Greek tycoon.
    **Frasier:** He fell for that?
    **Bulldog:** Hook, line, and souvlaki!
    
    _Meanwhile, Gil does his show:_
    
        **Gil:** You can keep your overripe Camembert and malodorous Stilton, 
             they can't compare with the salty insouciance of Greece's 
             glorious Feta.  It's not just for shepherds anymore!  This is 
             Gil Chesterton saying _Bon Appetite_ , or as we say in Athens, 
             _Kali Orexi!_ [_presses button_]
    
    _Bulldog falls into the booth laughing as Frasier explains._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Gil, you've been had.  The new station owner isn't Greek, 
             he's from Texas.
    **Bulldog:**[_to Gil_] You are so easy!
        **Gil:** Well, I hope you're happy!  I've just given four stars to a 
             restaurant called "A Taste Of Greece."  Which, trust me, is 
             no misnomer.
    **Bulldog:** Well that's what you deserve, trying to suck up to some 
             senile old coot!
    _The senile old coot - dressed in boots, string tie, and a cowboy hat - 
    enters the booth and hears him without Bulldog noticing._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hell, he probably can't eat anything but strained peas and 
             farina! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:**[_stopping him:_] Uh, Mr Boone?
      **Boone:**[_strong Texan accent:_] Yeah, that's right.
    **Frasier:** Pleasure to see you.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  This is Roz 
             Doyle, Gil Chesterton and... [_points at Bulldog_]
    **Bulldog:**[_covering up:_] I'm Skippy the lunch boy.  So, uh, that's two 
             strained peas and a farina for the big guy. [_exits_]
        **Gil:** Oh, uh, Skippy?  Change my order!  I've got a sudden hankering 
             for baby-back ribs and corn bread. [_exits after him_]
      **Boone:** Oh, I've been looking for you Dr. Crane.  I have a little 
             problem and they told me you're just the fella who could 
             fix it.  Oh, I hope I'm not imposing. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone.
      **Boone:** Well, actually I prefer "Big Willy." 
    **Frasier:** Don't be silly, Big Willy. [_Roz and Frasier keep in their 
             laughter_]
      **Boone:** You see, I'm engaged to be married.
    **Frasier:** Oh, congratulations.
      **Boone:** Well, sweet young thing.  Just nuts about me.  Problem is, 
             she smokes.
    **Frasier:** Oh lord, that is a very bad habit.   
      **Boone:** Oh, it's a vile habit!  Would have destroyed my affection 
             for her if, well she didn't possess certain... compensating 
             gifts. [_Frasier and Roz trade a look._] Anyway, as a favour 
             to me, could you help her?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll certainly try.  Just keep in mind, though, 
             addiction is fraught with many complex issues.  Length 
             of habit, motivation...
      **Boone:** Forgive me, sometimes I don't express myself too clearly. 
             When I say, "could you help her," what I meant to say was 
             [_definite:_] HELP HER!
    **Frasier:** Consider it done. 
      **Boone:** Much obliged.  She'll be in touch. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** That's me, Dr. Frasier Crane, bimbo wrangler.
    
    _He sinks into his chair with a groan._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, stop it! This is a golden opportunity!  You make
             this little tootsie quit smoking and we're halfway to 
             syndication.
       **Bebe:**[_enters booth:_] Did someone just say the word "syndication," 
             or do I just hear it every time I lay eyes on my favorite 
             client?
    **Frasier:** Oh, Bebe. [_they kiss cheeks, he continues to moan_]
       **Bebe:** Is something wrong, dear?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes.
        **Roz:** We just met Big Willy...
    **Frasier:** Oh, he thinks I'm some sort of a magician.  He wants me to 
             play therapist to his little fiancee.  No doubt some gold-
             digging piranha so devoid of scruples that she's willing to 
             rob the coffin and just... 
    
    _Frasier notices that Bebe and Big Willy and now exchanging kisses 
    through the glass partition._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!
       **Bebe:** Isn't it wonderful?  We met last month and it was love at 
             first sight.
        **Roz:** First sight of what - his bankbook and a cardiogram?  
             Two minutes. [_exits to booth_]
       **Bebe:** I'm hurt that she can even joke about such a thing.  I love 
             that dear sweet old man with every fibre of my being. 
             [_lights a cigarette_]
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] I'm sure you do.  I'm afraid there won't even 
             be a wedding if you can't get rid of that rotten habit, and 
             he's just ordered me to see that you do!
       **Bebe:** God, you'd think a touch of emphysema were the end of 
             the world!
      **Boone:**[_enters_] What's that in your hand, woman?
       **Bebe:** Sorry, pudd'n.  Bebe slipped.
    **Frasier:** Just that all-important last puff. [_stubbs it out for her_]
      **Boone:** Well, see that it is!  Well, Dr. Crane, I'm heading out of 
             town for three days.  When I get back on Sunday, I expect 
             my little gal here to be smoke-free by then.
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] In... three days?
      **Boone:** Now, you do whatever it takes to help her, doc!  Drugs, 
             straightjackets, electroshock... [_exits_]
       **Bebe:** You see how he dotes on me.
    
    _Frasier gives her a "yeah, right" smile.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Bebe is laying on the couch as Frasier wanders around the room 
    creating a stereotypical psychiatrist scene._
    
    **Frasier:** Excellent progress, Bebe!  You've really dived into the 
             emotional void that is the route of your addiction.  Your 
             fear of abandonment, your fear that those you trust will 
             suddenly turn their backs when you expect them to... 
             [_doorbell sounds_] Excuse me. 
       **Bebe:** My God, it all seems so clear now.  You're a miracle worker.
    **Frasier:** If I had a dime for every time... well... [_opens door_] Niles!
      **Niles:** Hello Frasier, I noticed you were out of capers the other 
             night, so I got you this. 
    _Niles takes a massive jar of capers out of his bag.  Frasier holds it._
    **Frasier:** Thank you Niles, but why so many?
      **Niles:** I just discovered a place called "Price Buster's Warehouse."  
             You have to buy in bulk, but the savings are extraordinary 
             and they have a huge selection.  I found french fries and 
             french doors in the same aisle. 
    **Frasier:** Well, the next time you go back be sure to buy me a thousand 
             swordfish so I can use these up!
      **Niles:** You laugh, but I could do it like that. [_snaps fingers_] So, 
             how goes the great smoke-out?
       **Bebe:** Until today, I had no idea what a brilliant therapist your 
             brother is.  He has tunneled his way into the very depths of 
             my psyche. 
      **Niles:** Well, let's hope he sent a canary down first.
       **Bebe:** Well, I'll be running along. [_to Frasier_] I'll see you at 
             ten tomorrow.  In the mean time, it's exercise, lots of 
             fresh spring water and nicotine gum for cravings.
    **Frasier:** That's my girl.
      **Niles:** Oh, Bebe, you know I'm writing a paper on addiction and I'd 
             love to ask you some questions - unless there's some reason 
             you're eager to be off?
       **Bebe:**[_covering up:_] Me?  No.  No, not at all.
      **Niles:** Well, I just need to discuss a personal matter with Frasier 
             first.
       **Bebe:** Of course, I'll give you some privacy.  It's time for my 
             water anyway. [_exits to kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, Niles?
      **Niles:** Let her out that door, she'll smoke half a pack before the 
             elevator hits the lobby.
    **Frasier:** How can you know that?  You hardly spoke to her.
      **Niles:** Well, obviously you didn't see the crazed, cunning glint in 
             her eyes.
    **Frasier:** She always looks like that, she's an agent.
    
    _In the kitchen, Bebe takes a cigarette from her purse._
    
      **Niles:** I know about addiction.  It's the exact same look Maris used 
             to get during the cough syrup years.  The only way to deal 
             with it is to lock her up, take her money, and watch her 
             like a hawk until it's out of her system.
    **Frasier:** That means she would have to stay here for the weekend.
    _Daphne and Martin have entered and they have heard Frasier's last 
    sentence._
     **Daphne:** Who's staying all weekend?
      **Niles:** Bebe Glazer. 
     **Martin:**[_worried:_] Here?
     **Daphne:**[_worried:_] What does she have to stay here for?
    **Frasier:** She's trying to quit smoking.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic:_] Oh great, that means she'll be extra lovable.
    **Frasier:** Not to worry dad, there is no reason she has to stay for the 
             weekend.  Bebe and I made a real breakthrough today.  If you 
             don't believe me, just come on into the kitchen and you'll see 
             that I'm right.
    _Meanwhile Bebe is smoking in the kitchen.  When she hears the previous 
    she licks her fingers, stubbs out her cigarette and puts it in her 
    handbag._
       **Bebe:**[_exiting the kitchen_] I'm sorry I can't stay and help you with 
             your paper, Niles, wedding preperations and all.  But I'll 
             remember those helpful hints.  It's exercise, gum, and lots 
             of water.
    _Bebe turns round and we see that blue smoke is wafting out of her 
    handbag._
    
      **Niles:** Water should come in handy for putting out those pesky purse 
             fires. 
    _Bebe begins to whack her bag._
    **Frasier:** All right Niles, secure the door!  Bebe, you are not going 
             anywhere, you're staying for the weekend.  Now give me that 
             purse.
    
    _She looks to the door, but Niles has already bolted it._
    
       **Bebe:** All right.  Let me remove one very precious momento.
    **Frasier:** Very well.
    
    _She presses the bag to her face and desperately sucks up smoke._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it! [_yanks it away from her_]
    
    _END OF ACT ONE (Time: 10:10)
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles, Frasier, Martin and Daphne are crowded around the dinner table 
    as Bebe eats like a scavenger._
    
       **Bebe:** More!
     **Daphne:** What again?
     **Martin:** That's her third serving.
    **Frasier:** Now, now Dad, it's flattering to Daphne that Bebe finds her 
             food so tasty.
       **Bebe:** I'm orally fixated.  I could eat a half-stunned wharf rat 
             if you put some gravy on it!
     **Daphne:** I'll bear that in mind come breakfast time.
    **Frasier:** No, please, please.  Let's all try to remain supportive of 
             Bebe.  I think she's really doing rather well.
      **Niles:** So, I hear your fiancee is well to do?
       **Bebe:** Very. [_to Martin:_] You gonna eat that fat? [_takes it from him_]
      **Niles:** Well, marrying money can have it's perils.  Ten or fifteen 
             years down the line, after you've adapted to a lifestyle 
             now totally beyond your means, you can find yourself cast 
             aside a hollow husk, penniless and crushed.
    **Frasier:** Niles, Big Willy's eighty-five, he's on his third pacemaker.
      **Niles:** Ah. [_raises his glass to Bebe_] Mazel tov!
     **Martin:** Just out of curiosity, has this guy ever seen you eat?
       **Bebe:** After dinner is the time I need a cigarette most.  As long 
             as I don't stop eating, I'll be fine.
    **Frasier:** Well, this is very good, Bebe.  You're already identifying 
             those moments that trigger your worst cravings.
       **Bebe:**[_dismissive:_] Yeah, yeah!
    **Frasier:** No, really.  Perhaps it would help to know that you're not 
             alone.  Dad is an ex-smoker.  Dad, can you tell us about 
             those moments you crave a cigarette most?
     **Martin:** Ah, when I had insomnia.  I'd get up, pour a water glass 
             full of Bourbon, light a cigarette - next thing you know, 
             I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Nothing relaxes you like 
             a cigarette. [_Bebe gazes at him longingly_] Of course, 
             gives you a hell of a headache in the morning.
     **Daphne:** Well, I smoked for years but I never became addicted.  
             To this day, I can buy a pack, have a cig or two, toss 
             them in a drawer and not crave another for months.
       **Bebe:** You know there's a word for people who can do that.  
             What is it?  Oh, yes - bitch!
    
    _Daphne goes to the kitchen._
    
      **Niles:** There's no need to be insulting just because you're wrestling 
             with an unhealthy and disgusting habit.
       **Bebe:** It isn't disgusting, it's wonderful!
    **Frasier:** Oh now, Bebe, tell me.  What is so wonderful about smoking?
       **Bebe:** Everything. [_with actions:_] I like the way a fresh firm pack 
             feels in my hand.  I like peeling away that little piece of 
             cellophane and seeing it twinkle in the light.  I like coaxing 
             that first sweet cylinder out of its hiding place and bringing 
             it slowly up to my lips. [_Daphne comes back with a bowl; 
             getting more erotic:_] Striking a match, watching it burst into  
             a perfect little flame and knowing that soon that flame will 
             be inside me. [_laughs giddily_] I love the first puff, pulling 
             it into my lungs.  Little fingers of smoking filling me, 
             caressing me, feeling that warmth penetrate deeper and deeper, 
             until I think I'm going to burst!  Then - whoosh! - watching 
             it flow out of me in a lovely, sinuous cloud, no two ever 
             quite the same. 
    _She's cast her spell.  Everyone now has a hungry, longing look in 
    their eyes._
    
     **Daphne:** More potatoes, anyone?
    
    _No sooner has she put them on the table than everybody leaps at them 
    quickly putting as much as they can on their plates.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    It is half past five in the morning when Bebe is fast asleep on the 
    couch.  Daphne, in her dressing gown, slowly creeps into the room.  
    She has a pack of cigarettes in her hand.  She checks that Bebe is 
    fast asleep, then slowly opens the balcony door so as not to awake 
    her.  She stays fast asleep as Daphne puts the cigarette to her lips. 
    
    Daphne strikes a match.  Bebe wakes up in an instant.  The sound is 
    precious to her so she goes over to the balcony door._
    
       **Bebe:** You're up early, Miss Moon.
     **Daphne:**[_spins around_] Oh!  God, you startled me! [_chuckles nervously_] 
             Ever since your little speech about smoking, I haven't been 
             able to think about anything else.  Please, don't mention this 
             to Dr. Crane.
       **Bebe:** Silence has its price, dear.  And I think we both know what 
             that is.
     **Daphne:** Forget it!  You can't make me give you one of these. 
       **Bebe:** Oh... can't I?!
    
    _Bebe slams the balcony door shut, locking Daphne out._
    
     **Daphne:** You open up right now!
       **Bebe:** All right, missy, here's the drill!  You drop those 
             cigarettes, I'll open the door, you kick 'em over 
             to me, _capisce_?
     **Daphne:** No!
    
    _Daphne runs to the other door but it is already locked._
    
       **Bebe:**[_getting to her:_] Oh, is it cold outside? 
     **Daphne:** All right, you asked for it! 
    
    _Daphne takes the packet and holds it over the balcony._
    
       **Bebe:** No!  No!  Please, I beg you.
     **Daphne:** Oh, oh no.  My fingers are getting weak.  Oh, oh, I'm losing 
             my grip.
       **Bebe:** Stop, please!  I'll give you anything you want.  I'll... 
             [_quickly:_] I'll make you a star!
    
    _The lights come on.  Frasier enters in his dressing gown._]
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell's going on out here?
       **Bebe:**[_childishly_] Daphne was smoking!
     **Daphne:** She made me!
    **Frasier:**[_opens the door_] Daphne, give me those.
     **Daphne:**[_does so and enters_] Oh, look at me!  I'm all damp and 
             chilled to the bone.
    **Frasier:** I'll get you a towel.  My God, it's five-thirty in the 
             morning! [_opens the powder room door_] Dad!
    
    _Martin stumbles out of the powder room with a glass of bourbon.  
    He coughs up a puff of smoke and hides the glass behind his back._
    
     **Martin:** I couldn't sleep.
    **Frasier:** Have you people all lost your minds? [_throws Daphne a towel_] 
             Alright, now listen, get back to bed, every one of you!
     **Martin:** All right, all right...
       **Bebe:** Thank god you came in when you did!  She was praying on my 
             weakness.  Who knows what I might have done, probably... 
             THIS!
    
    _Bebe snatches the pack and makes a run for it._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, get her!  Stop that woman!
    
    _Martin blocks Bebe.  Daphne gets in her way and Bebe throws her onto 
    the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Bebe, you will not be allowed to smoke a cigarette in this 
             house! [_she tries to edge around him_] No, no, don't even 
             think about it!  All right, just give me those!
    
    _Frasier corners her and wrestles the pack away._
    
    **Frasier:** All right now, that's it!  Back to bed!
    
    _He turns back to the hallway, but Bebe jumps on his back, reaching
    for the packet and snarling like a wild animal._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, you're insane, woman!
    
    _They fall to the floor, wrestling._
    
     **Martin:** That's it, no more house guests. 
    
    _Martin exits to his bedroom.  Frasier pins Bebe to the floor, with 
    the pack trapped underneath her._
    
       **Bebe:** Get off me, you brute!
    **Frasier:** Hand them over!
       **Bebe:** Never! [_phone rings_]
     **Daphne:** That'll be the neighbours! [_answers:_] Hello?  Oh, hello!  
             One moment, please. [_whispering:_] It's Big Willy! 
    **Frasier:**[_takes phone and nicely as Bebe struggles:_] Big Willy, hello!  
             No, no, it's not too early, everybody's up! [_Bebe growls_] 
             Well, you know, there have been a few minor setbacks, but 
             I'm keeping on top of her, yeah. [_Bebe growls again_] Oh yeah, 
             I know she'd love to say hi, hang on.
    _Bebe's growling and thrashing abruptly stop as soon as he puts the 
    phone to her ear._
    
       **Bebe:**[_sweet:_] Hello, pudd'n.  I'm fine, and you?  Oh, nothing's 
             too much trouble for you daddy.  Bye now!
    **Frasier:**[_takes phone:_] Yes, sir?  Oh, oh, really?  No, no, I'm very 
             flattered.  Yes, of course, I'd love to, I'll talk to you 
             this evening.  Bye-bye. [_hands phone to Daphne_] Thank you, 
             Daphne. [_to Bebe:_] All right, now listen up!  He thinks 
             I'm very gifted.
       **Bebe:** Mmm.
    **Frasier:** He thinks I'm wasting my talents in just one city!  My God, 
             woman, he wants to take me national, don't you get it?  
             Unless YOU ruin it for me!
       **Bebe:**[_cries_] Oh my God, sorry.  Here, take 'em. [_hands over 
             packet; he lets her up_] I don't know what came over me.
    **Frasier:** Well, don't be too hard on yourself, Bebe.  After all, 
             addiction to Nicotine is a very, very difficult... hey, 
             wait a minute.  This pack is half-empty! 
    _Bebe runs out onto the balcony with half a dozen cigarettes, 
    puts one in her mouth, and pats her pockets for a light._
    
    **Frasier:** For God's sake... I don't care anymore.  You know, I can't 
             help you, nobody can.  You want to ruin it for both of us?  
             Here, [_tosses her a lighter_] go ahead, knock yourself out. 
             [_Bebe begins to light cigarette_] I only wish I could be 
             there when it happens.
       **Bebe:**[_stops_] When what happens?
    **Frasier:** When you see that newspaper headline: "Big Willy Boone, 
             Millionaire, Dead." 
    
    _Bebe grins; she can see it too._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral 
             on the news.  Watch the casket being slipped into the ground. 
             Only, you won't be watching that.  No, no, you'll be watching... 
             the widow Boone.  Tiffany, perhaps.  Oh no, better yet, 
             "Kelli" - with an "I"!
       **Bebe:** Stop it!
    **Frasier:** You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels, sailing in YOUR 
             yachts, sleeping with YOUR gigolos - but, oh, you won't 
             be sad, no, no, no! [_chuckles_] Because you'll have your 
             cigarette. 
    _Bebe looks at the cigarette in her hand like it's a baby rattlesnake._
    **Frasier:** Yeah!  Clutched in your nicotine-stained teeth, smoke 
             whirling about your once-pretty, now creased, leathery, 
             smoke-ravaged...
       **Bebe:** Enough! [_Frasier looks at her triumphantly_] God! [_hands over 
             cigarettes and comes in_] You are one hell of a therapist.
    
    _Frasier closes the door.  Bebe lets out a sigh and sinks back onto 
    the couch.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **THREE SMOKE-FREE
    WEEKS LATER**
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Bebe is dressed in her wedding gown on the balcony.  She has her back 
    turned away from us and her veil is covering her face.  Roz and 
    Frasier, formally dressed, are sitting on the couch looking glum 
    as Martin enters._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, you back from the wedding already?
        **Roz:** No.
    **Frasier:** There was no wedding.
        **Roz:** No wedding, no syndication deal...
     **Martin:**[_notices Bebe:_] What's she doing here?
        **Roz:** No money, no fame...
    **Frasier:** Well, you might say things hit a bit of a snag. 
        **Roz:** No beach house, no pool boys...
    **Frasier:** Oh will you get a grip, Roz?!
     **Martin:** Well, what went wrong?
    **Frasier:** Well, they were halfway down the aisle - Big Willy beaming 
             proudly, Bebe radiant, supporting Big Willy on her arm -  
             when suddenly he clutched his heart, and his head slumped 
             against Bebe's shoulder.  Of course we were all concerned 
             at first, but then suddenly it seemed like he was all right 
             because they kept moving on down the aisle.  But if you 
             looked carefully, you could see Bebe's little biceps bulging 
             through her wedding gown, and I swear I noticed daylight 
             between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet.  Well, once 
             they got up to the minister the jig was pretty well up, 
             despite Bebe's valiant attempts to animate his features by 
             twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck. [_imitates_] 
             You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed.
     **Martin:** Well, if I were you I'd get her away from that balcony rail. 
             The doorman gets ticked if you even through a piece of gum 
             over the side. [_exits_] 
    **Frasier:**[_opening balcony door:_] Bebe, dear?  Please, come on in. 
             [_she does_] That's a girl.  All right, let me have a look at 
             you.  Come on, here we are.
    _Frasier lifts the veil to reveal Bebe with a cigarette clenched 
    between her teeth._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't really blame you, dear.  You know, Roz and I 
             are both upset too.  You know, look at it this way: at least 
             you're no worse off than you were before. 
       **Bebe:**[_angrily stubs out her cigarette_] You don't know the things 
             I did for that man - the depraved, Western-themed appetites 
             I satisfied!
        **Roz:** He was eighty-five, how bad could it have been?
       **Bebe:** Ever worn a saddle? [_Frasier grimaces_]
        **Roz:** Do I have to answer that?
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, Bebe, there are other Big Willys out there, 
             better ones!  Richer, older... [_she's not convinced_] Impotent!
       **Bebe:**[_cheering up_] Oh dear, you always know what to say.  I know 
             what hell I put you through over this.  I insist that you 
             take this, [_hands over something_] as a small token 
             of my gratitude. 
    **Frasier:** Oh Bebe, really... [_gasps_] Look, Roz!  It's a gold Rolex!  
             Oh my goodness... 
    
    _Bebe goes to the door and starts to light up a fresh one._
    
    **Frasier:**[_realizes_] Bebe... where did you get this?
       **Bebe:**[_beat_] Just don't wear it to the funeral.
    
    _She leaves.  Frasier debates whether he really wants the watch or 
    not.  He holds it out to Roz, who recoils in disgust.
    
    END OF ACT TWO (Time: 21:05)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Gil is in the radio booth doing his show, wearing a cowboy hat and 
    string tie, eating barbecued chicken and proclaiming his delight over 
    the air.
    
    An intern, Hank, enters and hands him a note.  Gil reads it, covers 
    the mike and whispers, "Dead?!"  Hank shrugs and nods.  Gil goes to 
    commercial, quickly throws off his hat, wipes his mouth in disgust 
    and drops the remaining Texan delights into the trash.
