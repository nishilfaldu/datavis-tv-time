    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Radio Station.
    Frasier is sat in his booth reading some papers as Niles taps at his 
    window.  Frasier signals for him to enter._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, quick, give me your museum membership card.
    **Frasier:** What for?
      **Niles:** I just heard tickets go on sale today for the exhibit of 
             fourteenth century Japanese netsuki figurines.
    **Frasier:** Oh, then the rumours were true?
      **Niles:** Hurry, hurry, I want to get there before the line forms.
    
    _Frasier is about to hand it over when Roz enters._
    
        **Roz:** Five seconds. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, just give me a minute, Niles.  Just sit tight, huh?  
             [_on air, reading copy:_] And we're back.  Before we take 
             our last call, I'd like to remind you that Mercy Hospital 
             will be conducting free blood pressure testing this
             Saturday on Whidbey Island. 
    
    _Niles takes a peppermint out of his pocket and begins to unwrap it.
    The cellophane causes a crinkling noise which the microphone picks up._
    
    **Frasier:** Hypertension leads to strokes, heart disease and other 
             maladies, so we should all be on the lookout for symptoms 
             like shortness of breath, [_motions at Niles to stop_] 
             quickening of pulse, irritability- [_presses cough button_] 
             Oh, will you just shove the damn thing into your mouth! 
             [_Niles puts the mint and wrapper into his mouth; lets go_] - 
             So let's all join together to help defeat this silent killer.
    _Niles now tries to pull the sweet wrapper out of his mouth, causing 
    more noise.  Frasier gestures him angrily into Roz's booth._
    **Frasier:** Roz, who is on the line?
        **Roz:** On line four we have Mac, who's recently moved here from 
             Australia and he's having a problem with a co-worker.
    _As Frasier takes the call, she points a warning finger at Niles._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Mac, welcome to Seattle, I'm listening.
        **Mac:**[_v.o.; broad Australian accent:_] Well, mate, it like your 
             Shelia said.  I'm working with a real yob-out.  He goes on 
             and on about things nobody gives a billabong about just to 
             show off how smart he is.
    **Frasier:** Well, you have my sympathy.  There's nothing more irritating 
             than pointless and pretentious erudition.  My advice to you 
             is to simply avoid him, is that possible?
        **Mac:**[_v.o_] Not really, you bloody wallaby!
    
    _Bulldog taps on the window behind him, he's making the prank call, 
    others are gathered around him._
    
    **Bulldog:** You're on right before me!  Stay tuned for the Bulldog. 
             [_growls_]
    
    _Frasier grimaces._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that's one on me, or rather one on me and my call 
             screener, Roz, whose ancestors were once heard remarking, 
             "Oh, what a nice wooden horse, of course I'll sign for it." 
             [_Roz is not amused_] This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you 
             good mental health.
    
    _Bulldog enters with his trolley._
    
    **Bulldog:** Gotcha!
    **Frasier:** How many times have I asked you to desist with your adolescent 
             antics?
    **Bulldog:** I've got a sense of humour!
    **Frasier:** I mean it, I'll go over your head!
    **Bulldog:**[_sarcastic_] Stop it, you're scaring me!
        **Roz:**[_enters_] Listen, you sleazy little lyme tick, you do that 
             one more time and I'll cut you off. [_he laughs_] And I don't 
             mean mid-sentence!
    **Bulldog:**[_truly fearful_] Stop it, you're scaring me!
    
    _Frasier enters Roz's booth where Niles is waiting._
    
    **Frasier:** Do you believe these hijinks I have to put up with?
      **Niles:** No.  Who would have thought it with a station whose current 
             motto is, "Yakkety-Yak, We Talk Back"?
    **Frasier:** Oh, run along. [_hands him museum card_]
    
    _Frasier and Niles walk down the hallway and bump into Kate._
    
       **Kate:** Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Miss Costas, I'd like you to meet my brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
       **Kate:** How do you do?
      **Niles:** Enchante, I'd love to stay and chat but I'm off to get tickets 
             for Frasier and me at the Japanese netsuki exhibit.
       **Kate:** You'll love it.  I saw it in Kyoto.  It's just such a shame 
             they're not letting the really rare pieces out of the 
             country.
      **Niles:**[_disappointed_] Oh. [_hands back card to Frasier_] As my Japanese 
             gardener says, _Maimoshi chikosho._
       **Kate:** Watch your mouth!
      **Niles:** Oh, you speak Japanese? [_she nods_] Oh, I'll just retreat so 
             that I can be one with my humiliation.
    
    _Niles bows and exits._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Kate, can I have a word with you?
       **Kate:** I'm in kind of a hurry.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it'll just take a moment.
       **Kate:** I seriously doubt that, but go ahead.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I've tried dealing with this problem on my own but 
             Bulldog insists on interrupting my show with his foolish 
             pranks.
       **Kate:** I heard.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well I did not spend eight gruelling years at Harvard 
             to be mocked by that juvenile jackass!
       **Kate:** Shameless!
    **Frasier:** Oh, he's beyond shameless!
       **Kate:** I'm talking about the way you manage to get Harvard into          
             every conversation.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure you'll mention your alma mater too some day - 
             when it's credited!
       **Kate:** Gee, you sure know how to ask for help!
    **Frasier:** No, I'm sorry.
       **Kate:** I know, I'll take care of it.
    **Frasier:** Just make sure he understands that...
       **Kate:**[_quipping_] You went to Harvard, I know, I know. [_exits_]
    _Frasier exits down the hallway as Bulldog carries on with his show._
    
       **Jack:**[_v.o_] Hey, the key to this game is the husky secondary.
    **Bulldog:** Jack, how can I put this to you delicately?  You're a moron! 
             Shut up!  You know squat!  You know less than squat!  You 
             and squat could go to the movies and squat could wear an 
             "I'm With Stupid" T-Shirt!
       **Jack:**[_v.o_] You're awesome, Bulldog.  Way to nail a blow on Dr. 
             Crane!  You are the greatest!
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, whatever, shut up. [_disconnects him_] Now, look, all 
             you guys sending in any postcards to win tickets to the 
             SeaHawks game - do I need another picture of the Space Needle? 
             [_Kate enters_] Chicks in thongs!  Enough said? [_notices her_] 
             We'll be back right after this. [_presses button_] Hey, what I 
             just said, I'm sorry.  I meant to say women in thongs.
       **Kate:** Stop busting Frasier's chops, enough said?
    **Bulldog:** Well I could, but see all these lines lit up?  They're all 
             waiting to tell me how funny it was.
       **Kate:**[_presses to his producer_] Are all these callers waiting to 
             tell Bulldog how much they liked the joke he played on 
             Frasier?
       **Pete:** All except the guy on nine, he thinks Bulldog sucks.
       **Kate:** Because of what he did to Frasier?
       **Pete:** No, just in general.
    **Bulldog:** So, what do you want me to do?
       **Kate:** If you think I'm going to allow you to publicly mock one 
             of our most respected hosts on air just for the sake of 
             higher ratings, you and I are going to get along just fine!
    
    _Kate and Bulldog give each other a smile.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **SINGING IN THE RAIN**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    We hear thunder as rain descends on the balcony outside the apartment.  
    Eddie, is sat nervous on the Armchair as Daphne enters with some pat e.
    _
     **Daphne:** Come on, Eddie, you love pate.  And this is the good stuff. 
             [_Frasier enters_] Uh-oh.
    **Frasier:** Two syllables every homeowner loves to hear upon entering 
             the door.  Would that have anything to do with the fact that 
             you're feeding my imported foie gras to a dog?
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm sorry, but it calms him during the thunder.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, heaven forbid that Eddie should ever work a nerve! 
             When Niles gets here we'll have sherry and snausages!
     **Daphne:** That reminds me, Dr. Crane will be a bit late.  Your father 
             asked him to stop at the vet and pick up some pills for 
             Eddie.
    
    _The phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm the one who's had a hard day.  How come no one ever brings 
             me tranquilizers?
     **Daphne:** I've often wondered that myself.
    _Frasier answers the phone.  The scene now cuts between Bulldog on air 
    at KACL and Frasier on the phone in his apartment.  Bulldog is putting 
    on a voice as a knot of grinning staffers crowd round him._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?
    **Bulldog:**[_posh voice:_] Hello, this is Dr. Julius Irving.  I'm calling 
             for Dr. Niles Crane, his receptionist said he might be there.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I am expecting him if you'd like to leave a 
             message.
    **Bulldog:** No, no, nothing important.  Some of the boys here at the club 
             have a little bet going about "The Mikado."
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps I can help.  I'm Niles's brother, Dr. Frasier 
             Crane, and as luck would have it I was in an all-male version 
             of "The Mikado" at Oxford.  People still ask to see my Yum-
             Yum.
    **Bulldog:** I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to "Three 
             Little Maids"?
    **Frasier:** Well, let me see.  Well, of course my falsetto isn't what it 
             used to be but, um... [_falsetto:_] "Three little maids from 
             school are we, prim as a school girl well may be, filled to 
             the brim with girlish glee, three little maids from school!"
    
    _Martin enters with his radio, laughing._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, would you please be quiet?  I'm trying to settle a bet 
             here.
     **Martin:** You sure are!  Some caller bet Bulldog he couldn't make you 
             sing over the air. [_laughs_]
    **Bulldog:**[_normal voice:_] Sayonara, Doc! [_disconnects_]
    **Frasier:**[_hangs up_] Well, Dad, I'm glad to see that you're amused, 
             having your own son humiliated publicly.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, it's funny.  He makes everybody look stupid - 
             the guys in the newsroom, Chopper Dave...
    **Frasier:** That is not exactly a miracle transformation when it comes 
             to Chopper Dave, a man whose life work consists of looking 
             down at the freeway and saying, "Crowded"; "Not Crowded." 
             [_picks up his coat_]
     **Martin:** Where are you going?
    **Frasier:** To the station!
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, Frasier, don't take it all so seriously.  You 
             know, we played jokes like this all the time when I was on 
             the force.  The day they replaced my bulletproof vest with 
             a big lacy bra, I knew I was one of the guys.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad.  That also clears up a question that's troubled 
             me for years concerning the night you were shot! [_exits_]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Radio Station.
    Bulldog is still doing his show on air._
    
    **Bulldog:** The "Salmon" that's what you want to name our expansion 
             hockey team, "The Seattle Salmon"?!  Why don't you take 
             your two IQ points, rub them together, see if you can't 
             start a fire, beat it! [_presses another button_] Hey, you're 
             in the doghouse!
     **Caller:**[_v.o._] Hey, am I on?
    **Bulldog:** Yes, take as long as you want! [_presses another button_] Next.
        **Rob:**[_v.o._] Hey, Bulldog, you're the man.  How about we name them 
             "The Bulldogs"?
    **Bulldog:** Hey, you want to suck up?  Send money!
        **Rob:** Wait, wait, wait, wait, I got another one. [_Frasier enters 
             with a menacing eye_] What about "The Lizards"?
    **Bulldog:** I hate lizards, they're disgusting.  They make my skin crawl. 
             You're an idiot and you don't deserve to live!
        **Rob:**[_laughing_] You're the best, Bulldog!
    **Bulldog:** Shut up!  Back in thirty!
    
    _Bulldog hands over to commercials._
    
    **Frasier:** I warned you.
    **Bulldog:** Hey, hey, clear your jets.  Kate told me to keep busting ya'. 
             Said it's good for ratings.  You got a beef, take it up with 
             her!
    **Frasier:** I don't believe you.
    **Bulldog:**[_presses over to producer_] Pete, what did Kate say?
       **Pete:** She said you're a pig.
    **Bulldog:** No, before that!
       **Pete:** She said keep raggin' on the doc'!
    
    _Frasier exits in anger.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - KACL Foyer.
    Frasier enters the foyer and goes up to Susan, her secretary._
    
    **Frasier:** I want to talk to Kate now!
      **Susan:** She's not in.
    **Frasier:**[_unbelieving_] Oh, very clever, "she's not in."  Like that'll 
             make me go away!
    _He storms into her office.
    
    Reset to: Kate's Office
    Frasier finds she is actually not in.  Susan follows him._
    
    **Frasier:** She's not in!
       **Kate:**[_enters, to Susan:_] I need a copy of our contract with 
             Nanette Stewart. [_notices Frasier_] What's Yum-Yum doing 
             here?  It's all right, I can guess.
    **Frasier:** You promised you'd put an end to Bulldog's shenanigans and 
             instead you encouraged him. [_notices Kate has pulled Nanette's 
             name from the board_] You're cancelling "Pet Chat With 
             Nanette"?!  She's been on for six years.
       **Kate:** Yeah, but she's been floating at the top of the bowl for the 
             last two.  When I went in to talk to Bulldog, the phones 
             were lit up like Times Square; his fans love it when he zaps 
             you.
    _Kate walks out into the foyer, Frasier follows her.
    
    Reset to: Foyer_
    **Frasier:** So, you would have me ridiculed for the sake of those hyenas!
       **Kate:** No, I would have you fight back.  He makes pot shots at you, 
             you come back at him in your droll, Ivy League, "look at me, 
             I've got a thesaurus" kind of way!  It'll be funny!
    **Frasier:** Funny?!  Funny!?
    _Reset to: Hallway
    Kate walks to the hallway outside the booth._
    
    **Frasier:** I refuse to engage in a battle of wits with a man who's 
             favourite t-shirt reads "Seattle Hooter Inspector"!
       **Kate:** Afraid of the competition?
    **Frasier:** I am a doctor, I went... [_off her look_] ...to medical school! 
             I will not embarrass myself by engaging in a grab for ratings.
       **Kate:** You just announced to a half a million listeners that you are 
             "filled to the brim with girlish glee."  I think the H.M.S 
             Pinafore of embarrassment has sailed!  Now, if you'll excuse 
             me, I have to fire someone.
    _Kate looks through the window at Nanette, who waves back at her with 
    her little pet dog's paw._
    
       **Kate:** Oh, God, she brought Spanky!
    **Frasier:** Kate, this is not over!
       **Kate:** Do you know what your problem is?  You have no sense of 
             humour.
    **Frasier:** I am sick and tired of people telling me that!
       **Kate:** Well, then, lighten up. [_exits to Nanette's booth_]
    
    _Meanwhile, Bulldog carries on with his show._
    
    **Bulldog:** I asked the Raiders' defensive line to describe their
             tackling skills and here's what they said. [_cues tape_]
    **Frasier:**[_v.o_] Three little maids from school are we, three little 
             maids from school!
    
    _Frasier scowls at him from behind the glass.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **THE NOSE KNOWS**
    
    _Scene Five - Frasier's Apartment.
    Daphne answers the door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Good evening, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane.  Did you bring Eddie's pills?
      **Niles:** Yes, and the vet gave very specific instructions. [_takes them 
             out and reads_] "Take one tablet per hour or as needed until 
             trembling subsides." [_realizes_] I'm sorry, these are for 
             Maris. [_take some others out_] Those are for Eddie, here you 
             go. [_hands them over_]
     **Daphne:** I'll just hide his pill in a bit of food.  Like our Grammy 
             Moon used to get grandad to take his heart medicine.
      **Niles:** If he had heart problems, why wouldn't he want to take his 
             medicine?
     **Daphne:** Don't think that nosy coroner didn't ask the same question! 
             Num-nums, Eddie.
    _Daphne feeds him the pill in some food as Niles pours some sherry._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, he's a good boy. [_strokes him_] Normally I don't believe 
             in popping pills for every little upset.
      **Niles:** I quite agree!  My nerves are bothered by this constant 
             thundering, too, but I would never turn to drugs to calm 
             down. [_sniffs his sherry_] Oh, mommy!
    _Niles takes a sip as Daphne rolls her eyes.  Martin enters from his 
    room._
     **Martin:** Hey Niles, you're not going to believe what happened to 
             Frasier.
      **Niles:** Oh, I heard the whole thing. [_laughs_] 
     **Martin:** You listen to Bulldog's program?
      **Niles:**[_deadpan_] Yes, Dad, I can't sleep nights till I find out who 
             hurled what ball through what apparatus. [_laughs_] No, no, no, 
             no, it was on at the vet's.
    _Frasier enters.  He looks very angry and is soaked to the skin, 
    he slams his umbrella down._
    
    **Frasier:** You would think that in a city with this much rain that people 
             would develop an etiquette about it, but no!  They buy 
             umbrellas that are too big for them, you have to walk into the 
             street to get around them and then they drive too close to the 
             curb so that you're sure to get splashed!  And they wear brown 
             shoes with white socks!
     **Daphne:** What has that got to do with the rain?
    **Frasier:** Nothing!  But I mean, really, get a fashion sense!
     **Martin:** Well, I guess things didn't go too well at the station, huh? 
    **Frasier:** No, they didn't.
     **Martin:** What happened?
    **Frasier:** It turned out the station manager is encouraging Bulldog's 
             little pranks.  Now she wants me to return his fire on the
             air.  Well, I thought the idea was absurd at first but now 
             I'm starting to warm to it.
      **Niles:** I say have at him!  He's grossly overmatched but he did 
             bring this on himself.
    **Frasier:** You know, you're right, Niles.  If I have to fight cheap and 
             dirty on his own turf, then I will!
     **Martin:**[_unsure_] Uhhhh...
    **Frasier:** And what is that supposed to mean?
     **Martin:** Well, I don't think it's a good idea.  You know, Bulldog's 
             pretty good at this kind of thing.  He's a funny guy.
    **Frasier:** And, I'm not funny?
     **Martin:** Uhhhh...
    **Frasier:** I don't believe this!
      **Niles:** Well, now, obviously Dad's forgetting the time you took the 
             names of our wine club board and turned them all into 
             wickedly derisive anagrams! [_laughs_]
    
    _They both laugh and shout out in memory "Sidney Ass Basket"!  
    They laugh uncontrollably and soon Martin joins in._
    
    **Frasier:** Now, you see, dad, I made you laugh.
     **Martin:** No, I'm looking at Eddie.
    
    _Martin points Eddie out who seems to be knocked out from the 
    sedatives.  Daphne notices and starts laughing with him._
    
     **Daphne:** I guess he won't be needing a second pill!
     **Martin:** Now, now, Frasier, don't get me wrong.  I think you're witty, 
             you're clever, but funny's different.  Funny's somebody who 
             makes you laugh with your belly.  Now, Bulldog's funny. 
             Duke's cousin, Louie, now he's really funny!  He's like 
             Jackie Gleason, only loud!  He makes you laugh so hard the 
             beer comes out of your nose.
     **Daphne:** You know what feels good through the nose?  A warm cup of 
             cocoa. [_the rest look at her, she says in memory_] I just may 
             go home for Christmas this year. 
    **Frasier:** You know, just because I haven't caused anyone to blow beer 
             through their nostrils doesn't mean that I can't.  Anyone 
             who can compose a clever ballad can certainly master the 
             intricacies of the whoopee cushion!
     **Martin:** Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.  It's a lot harder 
             than you think.
    **Frasier:** All right, you just tune into Bulldog's show tomorrow.  Pop 
             open a beer and prepare for a Budweiser geyser!
      **Niles:** You know, Frasier, if you're serious about that whoopee 
             cushion, I happen to have one at the house. [_they all stare 
             at him_] Last year a disgruntled servant left one on Maris's 
             dining room chair.  Fortunately for all of us, embarrassment 
             was averted when my little faun proved too light to activate 
             it.
    
    _The rest mull over this idea as the scene FADES OUT._
    
    **LEAPIN' LIZARDS**
    
    _Scene Two - Radio Station.
    Bulldog is doing his show as Frasier and Roz look in from the window._
    **Bulldog:** Well, it's six-thirty, sports fans.  That means it's time 
             for... [_cues fanfare music_] Our big SeaHawks tickets giveaway.  
             Yes, my curvaceous and bodacious assistant Darlene is rolling 
             in our glittery giant prize draw right now.
    _Pete enters with a cardboard box labled "Bulldog's Box - Don't Touch!"_
    **Bulldog:** Okay, Darlene, give it a good crank.  Whoa!  Honey, I meant 
             the drum! [_cues a cranking noise_]
    _Frasier and Roz are watching from the hallway._
    **Frasier:** Here it comes, Roz, the hilarity ensues!
        **Roz:** Okay, explain this to me one more time.  You were the one 
             who's trying to prove to everyone you're so funny, so why 
             am I the one who had to put the lizard in the box?!
    **Frasier:** It was just as difficult to be the lookout!  Stop whining!
    
    _Kate enters Bulldog's booth._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, look who's here.  It's our new boss lady, KACL's own 
             Kate Costas!
        **Roz:** Kate's there?  Oh, Frasier, Kate's there!
    **Frasier:** No, no, it's even better.  Even better that she will be an 
             eyewitness to my little jape!
    **Bulldog:** Come in, Kate.  Yeah, here we go, glad you dropped in.
       **Kate:** Hello, Bulldog.  Hi, Darlene. [_waves to Pete_] Wow, look at 
             that mighty drum!
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, give it a good spin! [_cues noise_] Look at those cards 
             going round and round.  Okay, Seattle... and the winner is...
    
    _Bulldog is about to pick one out._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, Kate, why don't you pick it?
    _Frasier and Roz look at each other in horror._
       **Kate:** Okay. [_reaches her hand in_] And the lucky winner is...
             YEOW!
    _Kate lets off a scream as the box falls to the floor._
    
       **Kate:** Something bit me!
    **Bulldog:** Oh my God!  It's a lizard!
    _Chaos ensues as Bulldog jumps up onto his console in terror, and Pete
    runs in to wrap his handkerchief around Kate's hand, while she is
    screaming in pain._
       **Kate:** There it goes, there it goes, there it goes!
    
    _The lizard scurries down the hallway._
    
       **Kate:** Stop that lizard, it has my finger!
    
    _Frasier looks horrified.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Hospital.
    Everyone is laughing and joking in the waiting room.  Frasier arrives
    with a bouquet of flowers and hovers in the corridor._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz!  Any news?
        **Roz:** Oh, yeah.  They sewed her fingertip back on.  She's gonna be 
             fine.  Frasier, would you wipe that guilty look off your face? 
             No-one even suspects you.
    **Frasier:** Why not?
        **Roz:** Because you made such a big deal about how playing pranks 
             was beneath you!
    **Frasier:** Oh, they're not only beneath me, they're beyond me.  I'm going 
             to accept my limitations, and be satisfied to merely be witty 
             and urbane.  Even my most barbed comments never drew blood!  
             Oh God, I feel sick.
        **Roz:**_You_ do?  When the lizard threw up her fingertip, who had 
             to pack it in frozen yogurt and rush it down here?!
    **Frasier:** I'm going to tell her the truth.
        **Roz:** What?!  Are you insane?
    **Frasier:** I've got to unburden myself.
        **Roz:**[_impassioned_] Frasier, you didn't start this.  You are the 
             victim here, why should you have to suffer any more than you 
             already have?
    **Frasier:** I'll keep your name out of it!
        **Roz:** Fine, do what you want.
    _Reset to: Kate's Room
    Frasier enters Kate's room to find her on her mobile phone.  A nurse 
    is by her side._
    
       **Kate:**[_into phone:_] I don't know when I'll be back in the office, 
             Susan, just cancel all my appointments.  Is there any word 
             on who pulled this stupid stunt?  I don't want excuses, I 
             want names! [_hangs up_] Will you hurry up that shot, I'm in 
             agony here. [_the nurse prepares to inject her_]
    **Frasier:** Kate, I see that your strength is back.  I brought you some 
             flowers. [_hands them over_]
       **Kate:** What kind of raving psychotic would do a thing like this?
    **Frasier:** You know, people use that word "psychotic" an awful lot these 
             days.  A kid steals a candy bar, suddenly he's a psychotic.
       **Kate:** I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna crush him!
    **Frasier:**[_to nurse_] Are you sure that's enough?  Make sure that all 
             goes in!
      **Nurse:** Call me if you need anything.
    
    _The nurse exits._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Kate, I came here for a reason.
       **Kate:** Oh, let me guess, someone park in your space?
    **Frasier:** No, but if someone had, I would have forgiven him, just as 
             I'm sure you will forgive...
       **Kate:** Who?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure the poor misguided prankster that perpetrated 
             this evil deed really had no ill will in mind.  It wasn't 
             his... or her... [_realises he can still weave his way out_] 
             You know, that Nanette from "Pet Chat," she had a real axe 
             to grind!
    
    _Kate lets out a short laugh._
    
    **Frasier:** What?
       **Kate:** What?
    **Frasier:** You giggled.
       **Kate:** Oh, [_laughs_] it was kinda funny.
    **Frasier:** What?
       **Kate:** What?
    **Frasier:** What's funny?
       **Kate:** Oh, I was just remembering...
    **Frasier:** What?
       **Kate:**[_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, the shot's kicking in, isn't it?
       **Kate:** Wouldn't you know, it bites my middle finger.  How am I 
             supposed to drive? [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] You know, Kate, maybe now would be a good time...
       **Kate:** Now you know, life is so funny.  One minute, you're standing 
             in a hallway, the next minute you're a poo-poo platter for 
             a lizard.  That's a funny word, isn't it?  Hallway!
    **Frasier:** You want to hear something really funny?
       **Kate:** And Bulldog, Bulldog's... [_laughing, then:_] Oh, see, now, 
             you're starting to get tired, I should go. [_start to nod off_]
    **Frasier:** Kate, Kate, before you go to sleep, there's just one last 
             funny thing I want to tell you...
       **Kate:**[_doped up_] O-kay!
    **Frasier:** I put the lizard in the box.
       **Kate:** O-kay.
    
    _Frasier walks away as she falls to sleep.  However, before he gets 
    to the door, Kate slowly presses the "head up" button on the bed 
    which raises her._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, God!  It's alive!
       **Kate:**[_half asleep_] You what?
    **Frasier:** Well, I, it was meant for Bulldog.  It was all an accident, 
             I never intended to...
    
    _She falls dead asleep.  Frasier moves closer to her to check._
    
    **Frasier:** Kate?  Kate?
    
    _Frasier decides she's asleep and he's safe.  He turns to leave her...
    
    CLOSE-UP: Like a cobra striking, Kate's hand snatches his wrist-
    
    SMASH CUT TO: Waiting Room
    Roz and everyone in the waiting room jumps as Frasier screams:_
    
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] NURSE!
    _END OF ACT TWO_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne and Martin are sat on the Armchair looking suspiciously 
    innocent.  They watch Frasier as he pours his sherry and he wonders 
    what is the matter with them.  He goes to the side, takes a book off 
    the shelf and sits on the couch.  As he sits, Daphne and Martin burst 
    out laughing.  It seems they put a Whoopee cushion under his seat.  
    Frasier takes the cushion out from under him and throws it over to 
    them.
