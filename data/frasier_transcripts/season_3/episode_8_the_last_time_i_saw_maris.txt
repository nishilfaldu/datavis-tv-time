    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is doing his show._
    
     **Vinnie:**[_v.o._] Anyway, Doc, I got this thing.  It's, uh, got to do 
             with women.
    **Frasier:** Well, I sense you're having trouble finding Miss Right.
     **Vinnie:** What, are you nuts?  I meet Miss Right most every night!  
             Eager young college girls, tough career women hungry for a 
             little R-and-R, if you know what I'm saying...
    **Frasier:** Well, you're leaving precious little room for 
             misinterpretation.  But I sense, despite these frequent 
             dalliances, that you're still not truly happy.
     **Vinnie:** Well, sure I am.  It's just that I lost a pinky ring in one 
             of their houses -- star sapphire, beautiful thing.  I figured 
             if I went public with it on your show, I had a pretty good 
             chance of getting it back.
    _Roz rolls her eyes.  Noel Shempsky comes into her booth and shows her 
    a piece of paper._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Vinnie, it's obvious you know nothing about this show, 
             or how to treat women.  But even more appalling, you know 
             even less about jewelry!  A pinkie no more needs a ring than 
             a neck needs a gold medallion!
     **Vinnie:** Just shoot me, why don't you?
    **Frasier:** I'd be delighted! [_disconnects Vinnie_] We'll be right back 
             after this.
    _He goes to commercial.  Roz comes into his booth, and Noel sticks his 
    head in after her._
    
       **Noel:** Hi, Dr. Crane.
    
    _Roz shuts the door in his face._
    
        **Roz:** He's driving me crazy!
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, we can't all choose our admirers.
        **Roz:** It's gone way beyond the admiring stage.  Have you seen this 
             petition he's got going around?
    
    _Noel comes in through the other door._
    
       **Noel:** Hi, Dr. Crane.  Could you sign this petition someone 
             "anonymously" posted in the lunchroom?  It's to the 
             talented producers of "Star Trek," suggesting a new 
             character.
    **Frasier:**[_reading_] "The all-powerful space vixen... Rozalinda!" 
    
    _Noel looks mooningly at Roz; she gives him a sour smile._
    
    **Frasier:** "Four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak!"  I'll sign that.
        **Roz:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:**[_signing it_] Well, Roz, television will never improve 
             unless the viewers speak out!
       **Noel:** Thanks.  I'd better go.  Well, [_makes the Vulcan salute at 
             Roz_] live long and prosper!
        **Roz:** Oh, just go! [_Noel leaves_] I am the joke of the station.  
             When I used to come in in the morning the guard would say, 
             "Morning, Roz."  Now it's "All hail, Rozalinda!"
    **Frasier:** Roz, I think you should be flattered.  Noel's attempt to 
             immortalize you is-is akin to... a love poem written by 
             Robert Browning to his wife.
        **Roz:** Did he ever write a poem where he gave her two extra breasts?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'd have to check my English Lit notes, but I think not, 
             no. 
    
    _The phone on his console rings; he answers._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Yes?  Niles, Niles, slow down, I can hardly understand 
             you!
        **Roz:** What is it?
    **Frasier:** Maris is missing! [_Roz gasps_] What?  No, I don't think you 
             should drag the koi pond!  Listen, I'll be right over!  All 
             right, just hang tight! [_hangs up_] Roz, Roz, how much time 
             left in the show?
        **Roz:** No, you go, do whatever you have to do; I'll handle things 
             here.
    **Frasier:** You're sure you can manage?
        **Roz:** If I can nurse quadruplets and still find time to rule 
             Rozniak, I can do anything!
    
    _Frasier grabs his jacket and briefcase and leaves.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **THANK GOD GUCCI WAS CLOSED**
     
    _Scene Two -- Niles's House
    Frasier comes in the front door.  Daphne is pacing the living room; 
    Martin is on the couch with the phone in his hand._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, what's going on?
     **Martin:** Yeah, Maris is really gone; I'm on the phone with the station 
             right now.
     **Daphne:** Apparently she just vanished.  No note, nothing.
    
    _Niles comes in through the glass doors, looking like hell._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier, thank God you're here. [_hugs Frasier_]
     **Daphne:** Any news, Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:** No, no, I asked the neighbors if they'd seen any strange cars 
             in the neighborhood.  One reported spotting something called a 
             "minivan."  But that was weeks ago!
    **Frasier:** Well, there's no need to panic, Niles.  I'm sure she's all 
             right.
     **Daphne:** Oh, dear me... [_picks up the poker from the fireplace_] I don't 
             want to alarm you, Dr. Crane, but I'm getting a very strong 
             vibration off this.
      **Niles:** Oh, dear God.
     **Daphne:** I can see Mrs. Crane.  She's waving this poker around and 
             screaming, "You thief!  Get out!  You'll never get away with 
             this!"
      **Niles:** Wait... no, I remember.  That's what she said to the decorator 
             when he tried to double-bill her for the andirons.
     **Daphne:** I was wondering why the intruder was wearing Toreador pants.
     **Martin:**[_into phone_] Yeah, Mike, I'm still here.  Yeah, that's right, 
             she's been missing three days.
    **Frasier:** Uh, excuse me?  She's been missing for three days and you're 
             just panic-stricken now?
      **Niles:** I only just realized it.  The last two nights, I knocked on 
             Maris's bedroom door to wish her goodnight and I was greeted 
             with a chilly silence, so naturally I assumed everything was 
             status quo.
     **Martin:**[_into phone_] Uh, thin.  Make that VERY thin.  Caucasian.  
             VERY Caucasian.
      **Niles:** Oh God, what could be happening to her?
     **Martin:** Oh, wait, wait, you got something?  O.K., uh-huh, O.K. [_to 
             Niles_] Mike ran a check on Maris's credit cards, there's 
             been a whole bunch of charges in New York.
      **Niles:** Oh, God.  She's been kidnapped.  Someone's using her credit 
             cards.
     **Martin:**[_into phone_] Yeah, O.K., slow down.  Armani... Valentino... 
             Cartier... Tiffany...
      **Niles:** Any restaurants?
     **Martin:** Any restaurants? [_to Niles_] Not a one.
      **Niles:**[_springing up with joy_] She's alive!
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles!  You're certain!
      **Niles:** Oh, yes!  From that list, she's recreating her infamous 
             "Sakes alive, I'm thirty-five" shopping spree!
     **Martin:** O.K., Mike, thanks a lot.  Yeah, I owe you.  Bye. [_hangs up_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so relieved.
      **Niles:** Oh, so am I.  I'm exhausted.  I was so scared. 
    _He notices that Frasier is quiet and dour._
      **Niles:** Frasier?  What's wrong?  You look positively uncelebratory.  
             Aren't you glad Maris is O.K.?
    **Frasier:** Of course I am.  It's just that... well, here you are, 
             all panic-stricken and scared to death, and she's off on 
             some shopping trip!  Don't you find that the least bit 
             upsetting?
      **Niles:** Yes, I suppose her behavior was a tad inconsiderate.
    **Frasier:** Well, she left without so much as a note or a phone call!
     **Martin:** Frasier, stay out of this.  It's between Niles and his wife.
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is not the first time 
             we've experienced Maris's selfish behavior!  She always puts 
             her needs before his!  She never attends family functions!  
             Doesn't that make you angry?
      **Niles:** Well, over the years I've learned to accept Maris's 
             eccentricities.
    **Frasier:** Oh, she's not being eccentric.  She's being arrogant and 
             selfish!
     **Martin:** If he says he's not angry, he's not angry.
      **Niles:** And even if I were angry, what would you have me do?
    **Frasier:** Let it out!
      **Niles:** Well, I am letting it out! [_holds out his hands_] I'm getting 
             hives!
    **Frasier:** Well, that is a triumph of self-expression!  My God, man, 
             why don't you just let out some of the words that you're 
             dying to say?
      **Niles:** Oh God, I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble!
    
    _He grabs a glass knick-knack off the piano and smashes it to the 
    floor._
    
    **Frasier:** A-ha!  You're not angry at me!  That was directed at Maris!
      **Niles:** Nope, that was for you!  This is for Maris!
    
    _He grabs another knick-knack and hurls it into the fireplace._
    
     **Martin:** Whoa!  O.K., all right, Niles, now you got it out of your 
             system!
      **Niles:** Yes, but it felt so good!  Let me do one more!
    _He runs around the room, grabbing various valuables and smashing them._
    **Frasier:** All right, Niles, this is good, this is healthy!  But you've 
             got to channel it!  You must talk to Maris!
    
    _Niles grabs a Ming vase._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh no, wait!  That's beautiful! [_grabs a porcelain "Commodore" 
             statue_] Here, this one's hideous!
     **Martin:** Hey, I gave him that for a wedding present!
      **Niles:** Well, all right, here!
    
    _Niles continues to smash things.  Marta comes down and sees._
    
      **Marta:**[_gasps_] _Dios Mio!_
      **Niles:**[_smashing_] Oh, Marta!  This feels wonderful!  You must try it!
    
    _Marta picks up something and smashes it.  She grins and nods._
    
      **Niles:** I meant at your house.
    
    _Headlights shine in the driveway._
    
     **Martin:** Oh my God, it's Maris!
      **Niles:** Maris?!  What?!  You said she was in New York!
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know, she probably flew back!
    
    _Martin and Niles ad-lib bickering for a second._
    
      **Niles:** All right, all right, no one panic, there's an easy solution 
             to this! [_grabs another vase_] Frasier, bash me on the head 
             with this, we'll tell Maris there was a break-in! 
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, stop it!  God, you are the damaged party here, 
             not Maris!
      **Niles:** But-but-but-but the mess!
    **Frasier:** This mess is the physical manifestation of years of repressed 
             anger!  It's time to draw a line in the sand and say, "I have 
             had enough!"  My God, man, _show_ her your mess!
      **Niles:** You're right.  It's time I told Maris I will not tolerate 
             this behavior.  I'm going up there and I'm going to demand 
             an apology!
    **Frasier:** Good for you!
    
    _Niles walks to the stairs.  Before going up, he takes the Ming vase 
    and tosses it over his shoulder, smashing it._
    
      **Niles:** I always hated that dynasty.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Frasier's Apartment
    Later that evening, Daphne, Martin, and Frasier are riding the elevator 
    up._
    
     **Daphne:** How're you feeling, Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** I'm fine, I wish you'd quit asking me.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a reasonable question for a man who just ate a 
             cut of prime rib the size of a hatbox.
     **Martin:** Well, whose fault's that?  You're the one who was too 
             embarrassed to walk out with a doggie bag.  For what it 
             cost, that meat was coming with me, one way or another!
    
    _The elevator stops at their floor, and they step off._
    
     **Daphne:**[_checking her watch_] Goodness, we've been gone three hours.  
             Probably have a dog with a full bladder in there.
    **Frasier:** Lord, let's hope so.
    _As soon as Daphne unlocks the door, Eddie runs out with his leash and 
    into the elevator._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Daphne, how do you feel about taking him for a walk?  
             I just want to get in there and unbuckle my pants -- since 
             I wasn't allowed to at the restaurant!
     **Daphne:** Oh, sure.  We all know how Eddie needs his exercise.  I mean, 
             we wouldn't want all that fatty meat he eats clogging up his 
             aging arteries until his poor old heart gives out.
     **Martin:** Oh and, uh, why don't you pick up some half-and-half at the 
             corner store too?
     **Daphne:** Get moving, old man!
    
    _She hauls him into the elevator with her and Eddie, and they ride 
    down.  As Frasier steps into the living room, Niles steps in from the 
    kitchen.  His jacket is off, his shirtsleeves rolled up, he has an 
    open Ballantine in one hand and the rest of the six-pack in the 
    other._
      **Niles:** There y'are!
    **Frasier:** Niles?
      **Niles:** Sorry to startle you, I let myself in.  Want a beer?
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** I have to thank you for putting me in touch with my anger.  
             I had no idea how therapeutic it was to just pick something 
             up and smash it!
    
    _As he says this, he lays a hand on one of Frasier's African 
    sculptures.  Frasier steps forward and surreptitiously puts his hand 
    on the base._
    
    **Frasier:** Well... you're welcome, Niles.  But, um, how did things go 
             with Maris?
      **Niles:** Oh!
    
    _Niles goes to sit on the couch.  Frasier removes the sculpture to a 
    safe place._
    
      **Niles:** I marched into her room and demanded an explanation.  It seems 
             that over lunch with her garden club, Maris heard that the new 
             Couture lines had arrived in New York.  So she hied her way to 
             the airport, and in her haste she forgot to leave me a note.
    **Frasier:** Unbelievable!
      **Niles:** Just thinking about it makes me furious!
    **Frasier:** Really?
      **Niles:** Yes!
    
    _Frasier removes the breakables from the table behind the couch._
    
      **Niles:** So I told her, "Maris, you were inconsiderate, and when you 
             are ready to apologize, I can be reached at Frasier's!"  
             Then I stormed out and slammed the door.  Of course, it was
             that fourteenth-century Bavarian cathedral door, so I had to 
             get two of the servants to help me slam it.  But what it 
             lacked in spontaneity it made up for in resonance!
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles, you know I'm not usually one to toot my own horn, 
             but I think in this case I was on the mark.  You feel good, 
             don't you?
      **Niles:** I feel great!
    **Frasier:** You feel empowered?
      **Niles:** So empowered!
    **Frasier:** And you'd like to switch to wine now, wouldn't you?
      **Niles:** Oh, please.
    
    _As Niles puts down the beer can and wipes off his tongue, the phone 
    rings.  Frasier answers._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Oh, hello, Maris.  Yes, Niles is here.  I'll see if 
             he's available. 
    
    _Frasier and Niles wait for a few seconds, letting her stew, then 
    Niles takes the phone._
    
    **Niles:** Hello, Maris.  Mmm-Hmm.  Well, I know you're not used to me 
           speaking to you that way.  That's rather the point, wouldn't 
           you agree?  Uh-huh.  I see.  Well, thank you.  I know this was 
           a very difficult call for you to make.  Goodbye.
    
    _Niles hangs up.  Frasier gives him a thumbs-up._
    
      **Niles:** She wants a divorce.
    
    _Frasier drops his thumb to a half-and-half position.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO 
    
    Scene One -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's later that night.  Martin, Frasier, and Niles, are in the living 
    room.  Niles has just hung up the phone._
    
      **Niles:** It's no use.  She still won't talk to me.
     **Martin:** Oh, just give her time to cool off.  Call her again in the 
             morning.
    **Frasier:** Geez, you must be exhausted, Niles.  Why don't you call it a 
             day and get some rest, huh?
      **Niles:** Do you have a blanket for me?
     **Martin:** Oh now, Niles, you've been going through a rough time lately, 
             you're not sleeping on any couch.  You can sleep in 
             Frasier's bed.
    **Frasier:** What?
      **Niles:** You're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
     **Martin:** No trouble.
      **Niles:** I wouldn't want to impose.
     **Martin:** No, don't worry about it, you're family.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    
    _Niles goes down the hallway to Frasier's room._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that was very generous of you.
     **Martin:** Well, it's the least you can do after getting him kicked out 
             of the house.
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, I was just trying to do what's right for him.
     **Martin:** Well, trust me.  I handled domestic disputes for thirty years.  
             The first rule is, don't take sides.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just a little difficult when it happens to be 
             your own brother.
     **Martin:** Well, that's the second rule.  When it's your own family, 
             keep your nose out of their personal problems.
    
    _Frasier gets up and gets his coat._
    
    **Frasier:** This is starting to make some sense.
     **Martin:** Well, maybe you should listen to your old man once in a while.
    **Frasier:** I know.
     **Martin:** I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, I'm just a cop.
    **Frasier:** But a darn good one.
     **Martin:** You're going to talk to Maris, aren't you?
    **Frasier:** I'll be back in an hour.
    
    _Frasier leaves.  Martin shakes his head.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **WHAT LIGHT BREAKS THROUGH YONDER WINDOW**
    
    _Scene Two -- Niles's House
    Marta is sweeping up the last of the mess in the living room.  
    Frasier is standing outside the glass doors._
    
    **Frasier:** Don't ignore me, Marta!
      **Marta:** Go away!
    **Frasier:** Let me in, I need to speak with Mrs. Crane!
      **Marta:** Missy Crane say, no you Dr. Crane, no other Dr. Crane, 
             and no Crane with a cane!
    **Frasier:** Well, at least tell her that I'm here!
      **Marta:** She know.  Everybody know.
    
    _Marta goes up the stairs, turning off the light.  Frasier steps back
    and looks up at the second floor._
    
    **Frasier:** Maris?  Maris, we need to talk!  Oh, look, look, I know you're 
             up there, I can see you through the shutters!  All right, if 
             you won't talk, listen!  Niles didn't ask me to come here, I 
             came because I care about both of you.  I realize that Niles 
             spoke to you rather harshly today.  Truth be told, is it was 
             I that urged him to express his anger.  As hard as it was for 
             you to listen to such criticism, you're a fair-minded woman 
             and you must concede that he had a right to be upset! [_the 
             window opens_] Oh!  Oh, Maris!  By opening that window you're 
             opening up a window to a long and happy marriage, that's good! 
    _A bucket of water is dumped on his head; he splutters for a few 
    seconds._
    **Frasier:** All right, you're expressing your anger!  That's good, too!  
             But, listen, in spite of that last little outburst, I am not 
             going to leave here until we've had some sort of a 
             breakthrough! [_attack dogs barking_] Well, I see our time is 
             up, I'll let myself out!
    
    _He runs like hell.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Frasier's Apartment
    The next morning.  Frasier is standing in front of the open 
    refrigerator.  Eddie is sitting on the floor behind him, staring._
    
    **Frasier:** I know you're there.  After last night, frankly, I've had 
             quite enough of your kind.
    
    _Daphne tiptoes in, grinning mischievously._
    
    **Frasier:** You can stare all you like.  I'm not going to give you 
             anything to eat.
    
    _Daphne whimpers like a puppy._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right, here.  You might as well finish off this god-
             awful Shepherd's Pie that Daphne made.  Lord knows it isn't 
             fit for humans. [_turns around and sees her_] Did that sound 
             like "humans?"  I said "Mormons."
     **Daphne:** You're not at your quickest first thing in the morning, are 
             you?
    **Frasier:** Well, it was a rough night.
     **Martin:**[_coming in_] Well, maybe next time you'll listen to your old 
             man and not come between a husband and his wife.
    **Frasier:** And here's Dad, all sleep-refreshed and bright-eyed, ready 
             to resume his lecture!
    
    _They bring the fixings for breakfast out to the dining table.  A 
    blanket on the couch shows where Niles slept, but there's no sign of 
    him except a note on the table._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh look, your brother left us a note.
    **Frasier:**[_reading_] "Dear Dad, Frasier, & **Daphne:** when you wake up 
             this morning I'll be gone.  Thank you for all your help, 
             but I don't want to be a burden any longer."
     **Daphne:** You don't think... no, I'm sure this is all completely 
             harmless.
     **Martin:** Yeah, my gun's still locked up... and the door to the 
             balcony's closed...
    **Frasier:** And we all know that Daphne's Shepherd's Pie is still in the 
             refrigerator.
    
    _Daphne gives him a dirty look.  Niles comes in the door with a 
    shopping bag._
    
      **Niles:** Hi-ho, everyone!  What are you all doing inside on such a 
             beautiful, clear autumn day?
    **Frasier:** Niles, you seem awfully chipper this morning.
      **Niles:** Well, I woke up this morning and I had a realization.  Like it 
             or not, my life is changing.  I'm single now, so I went out 
             and rented a bachelor pad.  Ooh, is that coffee?
     **Martin:** Don't you think that's jumping the gun a little bit?
      **Niles:** Oh no, Dad.  Maris, uh, ordered me to get my stuff out of 
             there by sundown, or else she'd turn it over to a church 
             bazaar.  Oh, and I got these jeans! [_pulls a new pair of 
             jeans out of the shopping bag_] Right?  Right?  And I'm 
             starting a goatee, and I'm thinking of joining a gym, but 
             I don't know whether aerobics or weight training is the 
             quickest route to "buff!"  Any thoughts?
    **Frasier:** One thought: seek help!  Niles, you've just been through a 
             very traumatic experience here and you are deep in denial 
             here.  You are going through some very extreme emotions 
             right now, and rather than feeling them, you're denying 
             they even exist.
      **Niles:** I'm not denying my feelings.  I'm so in tune with my emotions 
             that I was able to move through them quickly.  In fact, I've 
             logged them all in my journal. 
    
    _He takes out a small notebook and reads from it._
    
      **Niles:** Let's see, where are we?  Here... [_reading_]  
             "5 AM: Blissful confusion.  Something's happened, but what?"    
             "5:01: Ah, yes.  An overwhelming sense of emptiness and 
             despair."  
             "5:07..." - this one's hard to read... oh, right! - "Wept 
             uncontrollably."
             "6:15: All cried out.  Hungry now.  Ate entire box of Frosted 
             Flakes, they're gr-r-r-reat!" [_closes journal_]
             So don't you tell me I'm not in touch with my emotions! 
    _He exits._
     **Martin:** "9:45: get out the butterfly net."
    _FADE TO:_
    **DENIAL AIN'T JUST A RIVER**
    
    _Scene Four -- Niles's House
    Niles is standing to the living room, addressing the assembled 
    household staff.  Frasier and Marta are on the couch._
    
      **Niles:** It's not easy for me to say goodbye, especially after so many 
             years -- all we've shared, all that we've meant to one another.  
             Jean-Pierre, Marie, Bernard -- thank you for your years of 
             devoted service.  As a personal favor, please look after 
             Mrs. Crane.  It'll be just you and her from now on.
    
    _The staff look anxiously at Marta._
    
      **Marta:** Uh, the staff, they have a question: Can we come with you?
      **Niles:** Marta, I'm afraid this is a road I must walk alone.
    
    _The staff file away._
    
    **Frasier:** Must be very painful, isn't it?
      **Niles:** Painful doesn't begin to describe it.  But they're strong, 
             they'll get over it. [_some moving men come down carrying 
             boxes; Niles goes over to them_] Oh, watch that, careful 
             with those!
    **Frasier:** Look at him, Dad.  My God, he's locked in denial!
     **Martin:** Oh, for God's sake.  First you get him to move out, then when 
             he does he's not upset enough for you.  There's no pleasing 
             you!
    **Frasier:** Well, what would please me would be to see him actually 
             experience some real emotion!  My God, he's walking through 
             this thing like a zombie!
      **Niles:** Well, that's everything.  Shall we?
     **Martin:** You know, there's no hurry, Niles.
      **Niles:** Well, actually there is.  I have aerobics at five, and then 
             I'm meeting with my decorator at six-thirty.  Off we go!
    
    _Frasier and Martin get up and head for the door.  Niles starts to 
    follow them, then stops and turns around._
    
      **Niles:** Have I got my wallet? [_pats pocket_] Yes. [_turns to leave, but 
             turns back again_] Have I got my checkbook? [_pats other pocket_] 
             Yes. [_turns to leave, but turns back again_] Have I lost my 
             MIND?!  I can't leave!  This is my home!  You're not taking 
             me!
    
    _He slams the glass doors shut, with Martin and Frasier outside._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, open the door!
      **Niles:** Nope, nope, bye-bye!  Thanks for coming, I'll tell Maris you 
             sent your best!
    
    _Frasier and Martin push their way back in._
    
     **Martin:** Now, Niles, calm down.
    **Frasier:** No, no, don't calm down!  Let it out!  This is very healing!
      **Niles:** Don't you ever let up?
     **Martin:** Look, everything's gonna be fine.
      **Niles:** No, it isn't.  There's no life for me out there!
     **Martin:** You're just excited.
      **Niles:** I don't want to be a bachelor.  I didn't like it the first 
             time.
    **Frasier:** Niles, look, just sit down for a second, O.K.?
      **Niles:** Where, Frasier? [_wanders around the room; puts his hand on an 
             armchair_] Here, in the chair that Maris and I picked out on 
             our honeymoon in Vienna? [_goes to the piano_] Or here, where 
             I sit Sunday mornings playing Mahler while Maris dabs at her 
             watercolors? [_goes to the fireplace_] Perhaps here, where we 
             sipped champagne on our last anniversary.  Guess that really 
             was our last anniversary.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles...
    
    _Marta comes down the stairs._
    
      **Marta:** Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:** Yes, Marta?
      **Marta:** Missy Crane give me message for you: if you say is all your 
             fault, you no have to leave.
      **Niles:**...I can stay?
      **Marta:** She waiting upstairs.
    
    _Marta goes back up the stairs.  There is silence for a moment._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, before you make your decision, just make sure that 
             you're remembering things the way they really were.  Yes, 
             you bought that chair on your honeymoon in Vienna.  But 
             remember, you wanted to buy the chair that you saw in Paris.  
             Yes, you sit at the piano every Sunday morning and play 
             Mahler for Maris.  But you hate Mahler!  Besides Maris, 
             who doesn't?!
     **Martin:** Look, just give him a little air here...
    **Frasier:** Look, all I'm saying is that along with the good things in 
             your marriage, there were problems -- things you said you 
             couldn't live with anymore.  Now if you want those to change, 
             you have got to stand up to her.  If you back down now, you 
             will go through the rest of your life feeling weak and small 
             because you never had the courage to say, "I will not let you 
             treat me like this, Lilith! ...Maris!" 
    _Niles and Martin stare at him._
    **Frasier:** Well, I've lost all credibility here.  Dad, would you please 
             say something?
     **Martin:** I told you, I'm not telling him what to do.
      **Niles:** I wouldn't mind knowing what you think.
     **Martin:** It doesn't matter what I think.  What matters is what you 
             think.  Now if you want to walk up those stairs, we'll 
             support you.  If you want to go out that door, we'll 
             support you there, too.
    
    _Niles thinks for a few moments, then walks toward the stairs._
    
     **Martin:** What are you, nuts?!  You're gonna go up there and grovel to 
             that woman after what she did to you?!
      **Niles:** Actually, I was just going to get my car keys. [_picks them 
             up off the table by the stairs_] But thanks for the impartial 
             advice, Dad.
    _Frasier and Martin walk out the glass doors.  Niles follows them.  
    He pauses on the threshold, looking around the living room, then 
    closes the doors behind him and walks away from the house.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_

    KACL
    Roz comes into the radio booth with a clipboard.  She notices a gift 
    box sitting on her console.  As she picks it up, a gang of staffers 
    excitedly crowd around the window.
    
    Roz opens the box.  Inside is a four-cup bra -- two bras sewn together, 
    one on top of the other.  She rolls her eyes, then holds it over her 
    chest to see if it fits.  Then she turns and sees the staffers 
    laughing, bowing up and down and saying "Hail, Queen Rozalinda!"  
    Roz runs out of her booth and chases them down the hallway.
