    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is just wrapping up._
    
    **Frasier:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health.
    
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes into his booth with a small gift box._
    
        **Roz:** Happy anniversary!
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz!  Oh, this is so much fun, Roz!  I got you one too!
    
    _He hands her a similar-size gift box._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, thank you!  O.K., you first.  I mean, it's nothing really, 
             it's not expensive or anything, you probably won't even like 
             it, I'm not good with gifts--
    **Frasier:** Look, don't oversell it, Roz. [_unwraps it_] It's a tape. 
             [_reads_] "The Dr. Frasier Crane Show: Show #1, May 21st, 
             1993."
        **Roz:** It's our first broadcast.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz!  I can't wait to listen to it!  Did you ever think 
             I'd stay on the air this long?
        **Roz:** Oh, hell no. [_reads her card_] "To Roz, who believed in me 
             from the start."
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's from Hallmark's "Irony" section.
        **Roz:**[_opens hers_] Oh, Frasier, they're beautiful!  Earrings!  
             Thank you, thank you!
    **Frasier:**[_hugs her_] You deserve them.  Working side by side for three 
             years, one can't help but become close friends.  And they're 
             blue!  To match your... lips when they're cold!
    
    _She rolls her eyes at him as he goes out the door.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's later that afternoon.  Outside, the rain is pouring.  Daphne is 
    wandering around the apartment, dusting things and talking on the 
    cordless phone._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, Mum, it's not that I don't want to come home.  I'd love a 
             visit!  It's just that I can't!  He won't let me.
    _Behind her back, Frasier comes in the door with a bouquet of flowers._
     **Daphne:** Oh, you have no idea what Dr. Crane is like.  Why, he's an 
             absolute beast -- unpleasant to be around, a real tyrant!
    
    _Frasier shuts the door, loudly.  Daphne jerks around._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh! [_whispering_] It's just my mum.  I'm trying to get out of 
             a visit home.
    **Frasier:**[_whispering_] Oh, I understand.  All right.
     **Daphne:**[_into phone_] No, I'm not exaggerating!  He treats me like a 
             bloody slave!
    **Frasier:**[_shouting_] Daphne!  Where's my dressing gown?!
     **Daphne:** Not to mention how cheap he is!
    **Frasier:**[_as she holds the phone towards him_] That better not be a 
             long-distance call!
     **Daphne:** Yeah, yeah.  He does sound a lot like Aunt Lillian.
    
    _She holds the phone towards him.  He mouths, "I can't do Aunt 
    Lillian."_
    
     **Daphne:** I got to run, Mum.  Love you, bye. [_hangs up_] I'm sorry, 
             you must think I'm a terrible daughter.
    **Frasier:** No, not at all.  I think you're a terrible liar, Daphne, 
             but a perfectly run-of-the-mill daughter.
     **Daphne:** It's just that I only get one vacation a year, and I want to 
             go somewhere fun, like Acapulco.
    **Frasier:** Well, that makes sense.
    
    _Daphne takes the flowers to the kitchen to put them in some water.  
    Frasier puts his tape into the stereo and pours himself a glass of 
    sherry._
    
     **Daphne:** And going home is just so flipping boring.  It's always the 
             same.  There's a wonderful reunion at the airport, and we 
             share all our news on the way home in the car.  And by the 
             time I've dropped off my suitcase, we've exhausted all 
             conversation, and that's when I realize I've got a whole 
             week left with nothing to look forward to but Dad telling 
             the story of how he once shared a cigar with Winston 
             Churchill during the blackouts -- he thinks!
    **Frasier:** Well, it sounds like an easy decision, Daphne -- [_raises his 
             glass_] _Hasta luego._
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, why is it so easy to love our families, 
             yet so hard to like them?
    **Frasier:** Well, Daphne, that is one of those questions that make life 
             so rich... and psychiatrists richer.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well, maybe I'll just go call a travel agent, 
             see which guilt trip is more expensive.
    _Daphne goes to her room.  Frasier starts the tape and settles in the 
    armchair by the windows.  Eddie jumps into his lap and stares at him._
    **Frasier:**[_v.o.; sounding ridiculous_] Good afternoon, Seattle.  My name 
             is Dr. Frasier Crane.  If you can feel, I can heal.
    **Frasier:** Fasten your seat belt, Eddie.  It's going to be a bumpy ride.
    _FADE TO:_
    **MAY 21, 1993
    1:57 PM**
    
    _Scene Three -- KACL
    Frasier opens the door to his radio booth.  He surveys it for a moment 
    like a painter sizing up a blank canvass, and satisfies himself that 
    it is all right.  He places his briefcase on the console, just right.  
    
    He fumbles with the spare microphone and quickly puts it down.  Then 
    he pulls up his chair to the main microphone, and positions it just 
    right for his sitting position.  Finally satisfied, he takes a set 
    of practice cards out of his jacket pocket._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello.  You're on the air with Dr. Frasier Crane. [_reading_] 
             "Put your head in my hands."
    
    _He throws the card away.  He starts again, but stops and clears his 
    throat a few times.  Not satisfied, he does a few "me-me-me-me's" and 
    little Indian war whoops to warm his voice up.  Finally, he gets up 
    and paces the booth, doing an elocution exercise._
    
    **Frasier:** "Little owlet in the glen, I am ashamed of you, 
             You are ungrammatical in speaking as you do, 
             You should say, 'to whom, to whom,' not 'to who, to who.'
             Your little friend, Miss Katydid, may be green, 'tis true, 
             But you never heard her say--"
             [_turns around and sees Roz staring at him_] Who the hell are 
             you?
        **Roz:** I'm Roz Doyle, your new producer.
    **Frasier:** What?  Producer?
        **Roz:**[_shaking his hand_] Dr. Crane, I presume?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, but, uh, where's Dave? 
        **Roz:** Uh, he got another assignment.
    
    _Roz starts arranging things around the booth to get ready for the 
    show.  Frasier follows her around._
    
    **Frasier:** But I was comfortable with Dave.
        **Roz:** Look, Dr. Crane, I know you've been thrown a curve, 
             but everything's gonna be fine.
    **Frasier:** But I did a mock show with Dave.  I did mock-call-in's, 
             mock commercials, mock news bulletins!
        **Roz:** Look, I got a bulletin for you: Dave's out, I'm in, and stop 
             saying "mock."
    **Frasier:** All right, look, Miss Doyle, I'm sure you're quite capable, 
             but Dave has fifteen years of experience.  I'd really prefer 
             that he do it.
        **Roz:** Well, that would make two of us then, wouldn't it?
    **Frasier:** I really think I should call management and ask for Dave, 
             it's not really fair to Dave or to me.
    
    _He picks up the phone and starts to dial.  Roz cuts him off._
    
        **Roz:** Dr. Crane, Dave dumped you.
    **Frasier:**[_whiny_] Why?  We were here until 2 A.M. this morning, as I 
             explained to Dave in meticulous detail my philosophy of 
             optimal mental health!
        **Roz:** It's a mystery, all right.  O.K., look, I'm going to screen 
             a few calls, and--
    **Frasier:** No!  No, no, as I explained to Dave before, there will be no 
             call-screening.  You see, I want my show to be fresh and 
             spontaneous, and call screening squelches all of that.
        **Roz:** And the mystery of Dave's departure deepens.  OK, you're 
             on in five seconds, I'll give you a cue.
    
    _Frasier sits in his chair and puts on his headphones.  Roz goes into 
    her booth, puts on the headphones, and points to him.  Frasier 
    hesitates for a second, then reads from his next note card._
    
    **Frasier:** Good afternoon, Seattle.  My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.  
             [_reads_] "If you can feel, I can heal."
    _Roz rolls her eyes.  Frasier throws the card away.  Silence for a few 
    seconds.  Alarmed, Roz signals that there's dead air._
    
    **Frasier:** Let's see who's on line one! [_pushes button_] Hello, this is 
             Dr. Frasier Crane.  [_reading_] "You're on the couch."
     **Angela:**[_v.o._] No, I'm not.
    **Frasier:** Well, I meant on the metaphorical couch.
     **Angela:** I'm in a beanbag chair, O.K.?
    _Frasier throws the card away, then picks up the microphone and starts 
    to lean back in his chair._
    
    **Frasier:** Uh, moving on then, um, how can I help you?
     **Angela:** It's about my husband... Look, I-I just can't do this, it's 
             really too embarrassing for me.
    **Frasier:** No, no, please, please, dear friend, you must - I'm really 
             here to help you.  Please, go ahead.
    _Unfortunately, he leans too far and topples over backward in his chair.  
    Scrambling back to his feet, he grabs the wire to his headphones and 
    pulls it hand-over-hand to get back his headphones and put them on._
    
     **Angela:**...I've tried, and I've tried, and I just don't know what 
             to do about this!
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, often in these cases, it helps if you 
             restate your problem.  But this time, try boiling it down to 
             one succinct sentence.  Now, how would you do that?
     **Angela:** My husband is dead!
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps we should go back to the wordy version. 
             [_Angela hangs up_] Uh, we'll be right back after these 
             important messages.
    
    _He quickly goes to commercial and walks into Roz's booth.  Roz is 
    talking on the phone._
    
        **Roz:** Of course I could do a gardening show.  If I can grow 
             plants in my dorm room closet, I must know a thing or two 
             about horticulture--
    **Frasier:** Are you trying to get transferred?
        **Roz:** Bye! [_hangs up_] Look, Dr. Crane, I got to be honest with you 
             here.  It's just that I-I think psychiatry is, just, uh, 
             sort of - kind of... bull! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, this is a match made in heaven then, isn't it?!
        **Roz:** Oh, don't be offended.
    **Frasier:** "Don't be offended."  Why should I be offended?  In the last 
             week, I've uprooted myself from my home of fifteen years, 
             moved all the way across the country away from everything I 
             care about, and plunged myself into a frightening new 
             career!  The first few nerve-wracking moments, I walk in 
             here and find my producer lobbying to get herself 
             transferred to another show!  Abe Lincoln had a brighter 
             future when he picked up his tickets at the box office!
    _Frasier storms out of the booth.  Roz calmly sits back down.  
    Frasier comes running back in and throws himself into his chair.  
    Roz cues him, and the show goes on.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **MAY 21, 1993
    5:13 PM**
    
    _Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier and Roz are sitting at a corner table.  Roz reads from a 
    notebook.
    _
        **Roz:** O.K., you got to make the caller get to the point, and then 
             for God's sake, so should you.
    **Frasier:** Duly noted.
        **Roz:** O.K.  Number twenty-four... [_looks at him_] You know what, 
             you're starting to glaze.  We can go through the rest of 
             this tomorrow.  See you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Bye, Roz.
    
    _Roz heads out the door, running into Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, excuse me.
        **Roz:** Well, excuse you.
    
    _Roz leaves.  Niles turns and looks back at this rude and (as-yet) 
    unknown woman, then stands in line._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles!
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier! [_comes over to the table_] What a serendipitous 
             event.  How did you discover my favorite coffee bar?
    **Frasier:** Well, the radio station's right across the street.  I did my 
             first show today.
      **Niles:** Yes, you did, didn't you?  Well... good to see you, 
             have a nice day!
    _Niles turns back to the counter.  Frasier gets up and goes over to him._
    **Frasier:** Niles, aren't you going to join me?
      **Niles:** Oh, well, I would, but I have a routine.  I come in every 
             day, order coffee and spend some quality time... with myself, 
             you understand.
    **Frasier:** Niles, I've seen you once in the last two years.
    
    _Beat._
    
    **Niles:** Oh, that is your point.  Well... very well, in the spirit of 
           blood being thicker than water, why don't we?
    
    _They sit at Frasier's table.  Or rather, Frasier does.  Niles first 
    takes out his handkerchief and wipes his chair down._
    
    **Frasier:** I remember your fourth birthday party.  Grandmother took us 
             to the park to ride the carousel, and made all those little 
             children wait while you wiped off your painted pony.
      **Niles:** I was wearing Bermuda shorts and that saddle was slick with 
             toddler sweat.
    
    _Niles sits down.  Uncomfortable silence._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, uh... oh, uh, thanks again for dinner the other night 
             with Maris.  You two seem very happy.
      **Niles:** Oh yes, it's love.  Like the Arctic Puffin, we've mated for 
             life.  Honestly, I can't imagine even looking at another 
             woman.
    _Realizing there are no napkins at their table, Niles turns to another 
    table to get some.  As he does, the woman at the next table -- Daphne -- 
    turns to Frasier._
    
     **Daphne:** Excuse me, sir, have you finished with that sugar?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.
    
    _Daphne takes the sugar and turns back to her table as Niles turns 
    back to Frasier.  Niles stops and sniffs the air for a second, then 
    shakes his head and sits back down.  A waiter comes up._
    
     Waiter: You ready to order?
      **Niles:** Uh, yes.  Double decaf non-fat latte, mmm... medium foam, 
             dusted with just the faintest whisper of cinnamon.
    **Frasier:** I'll have a black coffee.
      **Niles:** You'll have to forgive my brother.  He just came in on the 
             noon stage.
    **Frasier:** I hope I never see the day when I am so frightfully 
             pretentious that a good-old cup of American coffee 
             isn't good enough for me.
    
    _Uncomfortable silence._
    
      **Niles:** So, how'd your visit with Dad go?
    **Frasier:** I haven't been to see him yet.
      **Niles:** Really?  You've been in town a whole week.
    **Frasier:** Well, I've been very busy, what with settling into the new 
             apartment, unpacking...
      **Niles:** Frasier, you're obviously making excuses.  I'm going over 
             tonight for my weekly visit, why don't you come along?
    **Frasier:** Geez, I know I should, Niles.  But I'm really in such a 
             vulnerable state right now.  The last thing I need is 
             Seattle's reigning sourpuss taking potshots at me.
      **Niles:** Is that what you're worried about?
    **Frasier:** Yes!
      **Niles:** Well, you have been out of touch.  Our father's a changed man.  
             Ever since he was shot, he's softened, with a whole new zest 
             for life!
    **Frasier:** Niles, I visited him in the hospital.  He made his roommate 
             cry, and the man was in a coma.
      **Niles:** Dad was still in shock.  The change came after.  As a 
             psychiatrist surely you've seen this?  A patient has a 
             brush with death and rediscovers his love of life.  Ah, 
             [_chuckles_] the laughs we've had when I'm over there.  
             I sometimes wonder if that bullet didn't crease his funny 
             bone.
    
    _The waiter brings their coffees._
    
      **Niles:** Oh... thank you. [_the waiter leaves_] Can you believe the 
             incompetence of that man?  I very clearly asked for a whisper 
             of cinnamon, he's given me a full-throated shout!  There are 
             countries in this world where they would lop off his 
             sprinkling hand!
    _Niles takes a spoon and starts scooping cinnamon off the top of his 
    coffee._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I'd forgotten what a weird little person you are. 
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Martin's Apartment
    Niles leads Frasier down the hall to Martin's door._
    
      **Niles:** Dad is going to be positively giddy when he sees that he's got 
             the both of us tonight. [_knocks "shave and a haircut"_]
    _Inside his apartment, Martin is sitting in his beloved Barcalounger -- 
    only here he has a matching couch, a dartboard on the wall -- i.e., 
    a fairly blue-collar dwelling.  He's watching a baseball game on TV.
    _
     **Martin:** Who is it?
      **Niles:** Niles, and a special guest!
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez... all right, hold your horses.
      **Niles:**[_chuckling_] How does he come up with those? [_Martin opens 
             the door_] Look, Dad, it's Frasier!
     **Martin:** Well, I can see that.  That punk didn't shoot out my eyeball.
      **Niles:**[_chuckling_] Stop it! [_to Frasier_] He sees the humor in 
             everything.
     **Martin:** Frasier, come on in.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.  [_they come in_] So, big game?
     **Martin:** Nah, they're losing again.  Pitcher's a bum.
      **Niles:** He's a bum, he's an absolute hobo! [_chuckling_] Isn't that 
             right, Skipper?
     **Martin:** Niles, are you drunk?
      **Niles:**[_chuckling_] Don't be ridiculous!  Seeing the three of us back 
             together again in the same room -- who needs alcohol for that?
     **Martin:** I do.
    **Frasier:** I do.
     **Martin:** I'll get you a beer.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad. 
    _Martin goes to the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** You filthy liar!  You said he'd changed!
      **Niles:** Well, it got you here, didn't it?  I've been dealing with 
             him all by myself ever since Mom died.  Now it's your turn, 
             so welcome home, prodigal son!
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] You guys want some pork rinds?
      **Niles:** And that's as close as you're going to get to a fatted calf.
    **Frasier:** No, thanks, Dad.
    
    _Niles sits on the couch.  Eddie jumps up and stares at him._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, will you stop staring at me?
    
    _Martin comes back in and hands Frasier a beer._
    
     **Martin:** Here you go.
      **Niles:** Ah, well, I understand completely, Frasier.  Dad, Frasier was 
             just saying that he'd like to spend some quality time with 
             you alone, so I'm just going to slip out.
     **Martin:** All right, suit yourself.
    
    _Niles gets up to go.  Eddie keeps staring at him._
    
      **Niles:** All right... oh, you haven't met Eddie. [_picks up Eddie and 
             turns him around to face Frasier_] Eddie?  Frasier is the 
             firstborn.  [_Eddie stares at Frasier_] The torch has been 
             passed.
    
    _Niles leaves.  Martin sits down in his chair.  The following 
    conversation is filled with uncomfortable silences._
    
    **Frasier:** So...
     **Martin:** How was your flight?
    **Frasier:** Oh, actually, I drove.
     **Martin:** You take the I-Ninety?
    **Frasier:** Uh, Eighty.
     **Martin:** Should have taken Ninety, it would have got you here faster.
    **Frasier:** Darn.  So, Dad, did you listen to my show today?
     **Martin:** No, I missed it.  Sorry.
    **Frasier:** That's all right.  
     **Martin:** How'd it go?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, kind of rocky.  Spent a good part of the day 
             puzzling over the proper signature line to use to introduce 
             myself.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, I'm looking for something that's familiar 
             but not a cliche, you know, something that's memorable 
             but not too gimmicky... [_Martin turns on the television_] 
             You know, it doesn't really matter if it's got something 
             to--Dad, please, I'm trying to have a conversation, it's hard 
             with the TV on.
     **Martin:** Well, I just want to get the score, O.K.?
    **Frasier:** I'm trying to describe to you my dilemna with that phrase--
     **Martin:**[_turns off TV_] All right, fine, I'm listening.  Are you 
             happy?  I'm listening.
    **Frasier:** That's it!  "I'm listening!"  That's fabulous!  Have you got 
             a pencil somewhere?
     **Martin:** Yeah, there's one in the kitchen on the table.
    **Frasier:** "I'm listening."  Dad - oh, I love that!
    
    _Frasier heads into the kitchen.  Martin gets up and gets his jacket 
    from the closet._
    
     **Martin:** Uh, look, I hate to cut this short, but I told some guys I'd 
             meet 'em down at Duke's.
    
    _Frasier comes out of the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** You're leaving?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  Whenever you're ready, I'll walk you out.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I haven't seen you in two years, I stopped by and 
             you're leaving in ten minutes?
     **Martin:** Oh, why don't we stop kidding ourselves?  You don't really 
             want to be here, and we don't really have anything to talk 
             about.
    **Frasier:** At least I'm making the effort.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah -- it's an effort to talk to me, huh?  Well, I guess 
             that's why you only bother coming home once a year at 
             Christmas.  Oh no, wait!  Sorry, I take that back.  Last 
             year you went to Arugalah, wherever the hell that is.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know you're painting an awfully bleak picture here.  
             Ever since I moved to Boston, I've come home at least three 
             or four times a year.  It's just lately things got a little 
             hectic, and I haven't been able to come home as often.
     **Martin:** Yeah... I noticed how busy you got after your mother died.
    
    _Frasier stiffens.  That's a low blow._
    
     **Martin:** But, what the hell, I didn't go visit you in Boston either, 
             did I?  So, uh, why don't we just drop this?
    **Frasier:** No.  The point is that we're here now, together.  I don't 
             want this night to end before we've at least tried to have 
             one real conversation.  Will you at least try, Dad?  Will 
             you just sit down with me for a while and let's try, please?
    
    _Martin sits back in his Armchair.  Frasier sits on the couch.  
    There's silence for a few moments._
    
    **Frasier:** So, uh, you know, I'd forgotten how much it really does rain 
             here.
     **Martin:** You get used to it.
    **Frasier:** Makes things green.
     **Martin:** Yeah... where would the old earth be without rain?
    
    _Silence again.  Frasier picks up the remote and turns the TV back on.  
    Eddie continues to stare at him.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- Frasier's Apartment
    Back to the Present.  It's now evening.  Frasier is asleep in his 
    chair, and Eddie is still sitting in his lap.  Frasier wakes up and 
    sees Eddie staring at him._
    
    **Frasier:** My darling, I would have thought that old fascination would 
             wear off by now.
    _He gives Eddie a great big kiss on the head.  Eddie runs off.  
    Niles and Martin come in the door._
    
      **Niles:** Well, hello, there!
     **Martin:** Hey!
    **Frasier:** Oh, hey, guys.
      **Niles:** Frasier, Dad tells me you've been on the air three years 
             today, so we'd like to take you out for a celebratory dinner.
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you.  Dad, how did you know?
     **Martin:** Well, I heard that woman who called in.
    **Frasier:**[_surprised_] You listened to my show?
     **Martin:** Well, I sort of... I feel asleep during the Mariners' game... 
             but when I woke up, you were on.
    **Frasier:** And you didn't turn me off.
     **Martin:** I did not!  I listened to you for ten minutes before 
             I finally dozed off again. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Faint praise, and yet it thunders in my ears!
    
    _Daphne comes in with a handful of travel brochures._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
    
    _Everyone ad-libs hellos._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Daphne, we're going out to dinner.  You want to join us?
     **Daphne:** Oh, thanks, but no.  I promised myself that tonight I'd decide 
             what I'm doing on my vacation -- either home to the family or 
             to sunny Acapulco.  I may just squeeze into my bikini and let 
             my hips make the decision.
    
    _She goes to the kitchen.  Niles rocks on his heels for a second._
    
      **Niles:** Of course, it would be more memorable if we celebrated at 
             home, just for a--
    **Frasier:** Let's go, let's go!
    
    _Frasier steers him to the door.  Daphne comes back._
    
     **Daphne:** Have a lovely time!
    **Frasier:** Oh, fellas, hold the elevator for me.
      **Niles:** All right.
    **Frasier:** Daphne?  
    
    _Frasier sits Daphne on the couch next to him._
    
    **Frasier:** I was just thinking about our discussion earlier this 
             afternoon, and I've decided to give you an extra week 
             off.  That way you can go to Manchester, _and_ Acapulco.
     **Daphne:** Oh, that's so sweet!  You really must think I should go home.
    **Frasier:** Well, I've just realized that being part of a family is really 
             worth the effort.  And very often the effort... means you'll 
             need a week in Acapulco, so...
     **Daphne:**[_kisses him on the cheek and hugs him_] Thank you, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** You're welcome.
     **Daphne:**[_sighs_] I guess if I try a little harder, it won't be so bad.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's a good way of thinking.  You know, things can 
             get better.
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] Hey, let's go!  I got acid burning a hole in my 
             stomach!
    
    _Daphne gives Frasier a look._
    
    **Frasier:** Still... would you mind leaving those brochures of Acapulco 
             out for me?
    
    _Daphne signals him "right" with the brochures.  He goes out the door.
