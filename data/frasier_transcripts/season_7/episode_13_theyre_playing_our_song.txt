                                                    Directed by David Lee

    N.B. This transcript was originally completed by Nick Hartley.  During
    revisions to the site, it was lost.  I apologize to Nick for losing his
    work, and Kelly has tried to reproduce it here as closely as possible.
    I also apologize to fans who have noticed this gap in the site for some
    weeks now.
    
    However, I am extremely pleased to have Kelly, with his training in
    musicology, add his own interpretation of the recording session.  The
    richness of his terminology helps convey just how far overboard Frasier
    goes, in a screamingly funny way.

    **Skyline:** A moon rises above the city.
    
    _ACT I
    
    Scene 1 - KACL
    Frasier is finishing a segment._
    
    **Frasier:** And we'll be right back after this short news break.
    
    _Gil enters._
    
        **Gil:** Frasier...I'm here to give you an advance tip.
    **Frasier:** Really?
    
    _Roz enters from the booth._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Gil.
        **Gil:** Roz!  I'm about to review a divine new Italian trattoria
             I've discovered called "Bella, Bella."
    **Frasier:** Ah-ha.
        **Gil:** I'm alerting you now because once I review it, reservations
             will be impossible to come by.
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you, Gil, it's always gratifying to be a few
             minutes ahead of a trend.
        **Gil:** They make an osso bucco that's so divine I call it the
             "Veal Shank Redemption."
    
    _They give Gil a courtesy laugh.  Kenny enters._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, guys.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Kenny.
      **Kenny:** Show's going great, Frasier, uh, only one thing missing, of
             course...
    **Frasier:** I know, I know, a new theme song.  I'm sorry, I just haven't
             gotten around to it yet.
      **Kenny:** Well, Mrs. Delafield's been hounding me on this.  She really
             thinks each show having a theme song will help hook the 
             listeners.  Gil's got his.
        **Gil:** My first choice was "Food, Glorious Food" from the show _Oliver!_
    **Frasier:** Ooh, that's a perfect match.  Haute cuisine and a chorus of
             starving orphans.
        **Gil:** But then, a composer friend of mine came up with this little
             ditty for me [_He sings:_]
             _Whether choosing a wine
             Or the best place to dine--
             It's all a matter of taste (Yes, sir!)
             It's all a matter of taste!_
      **Kenny:** Great, huh?
    
    _Frasier politely nods.  The tune is as lame as the lyrics._
    
        **Gil:** And the nicest thing is, he didn't take a penny for it!
    **Frasier:** Well, at least he has a conscience.
    
    _He chuckles.  Gil leaves, somewhat miffed._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, Kenny, I'm sorry for procrastinating this thing.
             I-I tell you, I'll get one as soon as I possibly can.
      **Kenny:** Well, you better come up with something here.  I'm sorry to
             be a hard-ass.  It's the part of my job I hate the most, but
             I need this thing on my desk by Monday...ish.
    
    _Kenny smiles and leaves._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz - hearing Gil's little ditty puts me in mind
             that maybe we should just do - ah, an original song.
        **Roz:** Well, my new boyfriend Leon is in a band.  He could write one
             for you.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, I was thinking of composing it myself.  I am
             not without musical ability, you know.
        **Roz:** Could you at least hire Leon to accompany you?
    **Frasier:** I take it he's desperate for work?
        **Roz:** Hasn't had a gig in months.  Music is all he knows.  He's not
             good at anything else - except in bed.  It's what he does best.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.  How long did it take you to find that out?
        **Roz:**[_about the show_] Ten seconds, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, longer than usual.
    
    _She returns to her booth and he replaces his headphones.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment
    He opens the door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.  Oh, dear.  We had dinner plans tonight, didn't we?
      **Niles:** Yes.  Don't tell me you're canceling.
    **Frasier:** Well, I have to.  I have a little project this evening.
      **Niles:** Oh.  Would this have anything to do with this new theme song
             you promised your listeners?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, it does.  I've got to have something by
             Monday, and I thought I'd take advantage of a nice quiet
             evening at home.
    
    _The loud sound of a vacuum is heard._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Daphne - Daphne!  Would you please turn off that vacuum
             cleaner?
    
    _Daphne enters with a fancy steam cleaner._
    
     **Daphne:** It's not a vacuum cleaner.  It's the "Dirt Scourge 2000."
             A total cleansing system.
     **Martin:**[_from his chair_] Is it new?
     **Daphne:** Yeah.  I got it this afternoon.  You see, this water traps
             all of the dirt particles instead of recycling them back
             into the air.  I got all that [_indicating_] from Dr. Crane's
             pillow.
    
    _Niles examines the dirt._
    
     **Martin:** Ew.
      **Niles:** I've been begging you to switch to a more abrasive loofah.
     **Daphne:** Well, it would be the same for anyone.  Dead skin, dust 
             mites... that's what we're all sleeping on, only we don't 
             know it.
     **Martin:** We do now.  Geez.
    
    _Martin rises and exits toward the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** This is the chance I've been waiting for.
    _She turns on the machine and begins to apply it to Martin's chair.
    The machine begins to audibly struggle, and the water in the tank
    immediately turns black and brackish.  Niles and Frasier watch
    with concern.  She has barely started when it suddenly shorts out,
    sparks flying in an electrical explosion.  When the smoke clears,
    Daphne walks back to the main part of the cleaner._
    
    **Frasier:** Well.  Apparently the "Dirt Scourge 2000" is no match for
             the "Dirt Pile 1957."
     **Daphne:** Well, this is going back.  On the commercial they clean all
             the mud off a hippopotamus. 
    
    [_She exits._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well, at least now I can get down to work.  You know, Niles,
             I'm sorry again about dinner, but can I buy you a sherry?
      **Niles:** Oh... thank you.  About this theme song of yours... why don't
             you just use a standard?
    **Frasier:** Actually, I want to compose one myself.  I've always had an
             affinity for music, and I've often wondered what I might
             achieve if I just rolled up my sleeves and gave it a try.
     **Martin:**[_re-entering_] Didn't you write some kind of musical back in
             prep school?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I did, Dad.  Niles was in it.  You know, the whole
             school came out humming my opening anthem.
      **Niles:** They went in humming it.  It was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
             note for note.
    **Frasier:**[_over Niles_] It was not.
      **Niles:** It absolutely was.
    **Frasier:** It was not at all.
      **Niles:**[_singing to the tune of the "Ode to Joy" theme from the finale
             of Beethoven's Ninth:_]
             _We are valiant men of honor
             Wenching, brawling sons of..._
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, well, I suppose I may have borrowed a 
             Note or two as a launching pad.
      **Niles:**[_moving to the third, contrasting phrase of the Beethoven theme_]
             _Prancing, leaping, laughing..._
    **Frasier:** All right, point taken.
      **Niles:**_Over hill and..._
    **Frasier:** Stop it!
      **Niles:** I'm just teasing.  Actually, it was a wonderful show.  I was
             very proud to be acting in it.
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, you were wonderful in it as well.
      **Niles:** Well, thank you, I thought so.
    **Frasier:** Mm-hmm.
      **Niles:** I often thought if I'd kept at it, I could have been a 
             professional actor.
    **Frasier:** Ah, you see, we all have a road not taken, some unfinished 
             business worth exploring.
     **Martin:** Yeah, I always wanted to be a toe dancer, but a bullet ended 
             my dream.
    
    _Frasier and Niles shake off the sarcasm._
    
      **Niles:** Well, Frasier, if you need any help with this, I'm right here.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Niles.  You know, I'd rather handle the composing
             chores myself, but I could use a sounding board.
      **Niles:** Fair enough, let's put our heads together.
    **Frasier:** All right.
      **Niles:** Figuratively speaking, of course.  I saw what came out of your
             pillow.
    
    _They head back toward the piano.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **A BRIDGE TOO FAR**
    
    _Scene 3 - Later that night
    Niles plunks out some notes on the piano.  Frasier is standing._
    
      **Niles:** You know, I think this new bridge is the best thing you've
             written.
    **Frasier:** Really?
      **Niles:** Oh, absolutely.
    
    _He sings to a jaunty tune, beginning with the notes he had plunked
    and accompanying himself:_
    
      **Niles:**_Claustrophobia
             Nymphomania
             He will probe ya
             He'll explain t'ya_
             It's brilliant.
    **Frasier:** You know, it does have a Cole Porter-y, Stephen Sondheim-y 
             flavor, doesn't it?
      **Niles:** Oh, absolutely.  Sondheim-y would have killed to have written 
             this.
    **Frasier:** You know what?  I'm a little nervous.  It just may be a bit 
             too conventional.  Perhaps instead of a regular bridge, I 
             could substitute it with a dramatic monologue spoken against 
             a musical background.
      **Niles:**[_after a beat_] I like it.
    **Frasier:** Of course, I would have to hire an actor.
      **Niles:** Yes, I suppose you could squander a lot of money on some so-
             Called professional... someone who doesn't know a thing about 
             psychiatry. [_reaching_] Who doesn't understand the whole 
             Gestalt.
    **Frasier:** Or maybe you could do it.
      **Niles:** I think so.
    
    _Frasier laughs and taps him on the shoulder._
    
    **Frasier:** I will write you a speech that will challenge your entire
             histrionic range!  This is so exciting!  Let's play the 
             chorus again.
    
    _Martin enters from his bedroom._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, hey, Fras!  I just got an idea for your little jingle.
             It came to me while I was brushing my teeth. [_He sings:_]
             _What's new?  I'm listenin'
             Feelin' blue?  I'm listenin'..._
             Cause, you know, that's what you say on your show.
             _Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' glad, feelin' bad
             I'm listenin'!_
     **Daphne:**[_who has been seated at the dining table_] Bravo!  That's
             wonderful.
     **Martin:** Thanks, you know, it's catchy.  That's what counts in a jingle.
    
    [_N.B. Of interest: John Mahoney appeared on the Cheers episode "Do Not 
    Forsake Me, O My Postman" as Sy Flembeck, a hapless jingle composer._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_politely_] Uh-huh, well, that's very, very nice, Dad, it's 
             just that, well, you know, I did promise my listeners that 
             I'd compose this myself.  It's no fair cheating.
     **Martin:** Oh, well, it's not cheating, technically...
    **Frasier:**[_cutting him off_] Very good, Dad, very good, but thank you, 
             and off you go.
     **Martin:** Okay, all right.
    
    _He exits._
    
      **Niles:** Hey, um, Frasier, are you sure you want to modulate here?  
             That may just complicate things.
    **Frasier:** Perhaps.  You know, I'm just trying to make it interesting.  
             To my ear, there's still something lacking, some tiny 
             ingredient that's missing.  I'm not sure what.
    
    _Scene 4 -
    DISSOLVE to a rehearsal hall, where a full orchestra is tuning their
    instruments.  Frasier stands on the conductor's podium._
    
    **Frasier:**[_tapping his baton_] All right, everyone.  Let's try this 
             again.  We still have a few minutes before the choir gets 
             here.
    
    _He raises his baton and prepares to cue the opening.  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT I
    
    ACT II
    
    Scene 5 - The rehearsal hall
    The choir has arrived._
    
     **Frasier:** Well, finally, the choir has deigned to join us.
    **Director:** Sorry, our bus broke down.  We had to walk two miles to get
              here.
     **Frasier:** Ah, then I suppose we can dispense with the breathing 
              exercises I was going to recommend.  Please, if you 
              would. [_indicating the choir's risers behind the orchestra_] 
              Off you go.
    _Niles, who has been sitting in front of the orchestra, rises._ 
    
       **Niles:** Uh, Frasier... did you mean to cut paragraph five of my 
              monologue?
     **Frasier:** Gosh, I might have, Niles.  I've just been so busy.  What was
              the gist?
       **Niles:** A lighthearted lampoon of mental health care abuse.
     **Frasier:** Ah, yes, I did.  I was afraid that some fussbudget might take
              offense at my jape about lobotomies.
       **Niles:** Well, I suppose it's best to play it safe, although I did 
              Like the way you indicated manic depression with a slide 
              whistle.
    
    _Frasier laughs.  Niles looks back at the orchestra._
    
      **Niles:** Do we really have to use so many musicians?
    **Frasier:** For the sound I want, yes.
      **Niles:** Whatever happened to the concept of "less is more"?
    **Frasier:** Ah, but if less is more, just think of how much more "more" 
             will be.
    
    _Niles stares at him quizically._
    
    **Frasier:** You may be seated.
    
    _Niles takes his seat._
    
      **Frasier:** Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention, please, 
               I'd like to take a few minutes to explain my artistic 
               vision.
    **Timpanist:** Take as long as you want, we're all on the clock.
      **Frasier:** Point well taken, moving right along...
    
    _Roz enters quickly with her boyfriend Leon._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier...I'm sorry we're late.  We got stuck in traffic.  
             Some stupid bus broke down.  This is Leon.
    
    _Leon looks like a starving folk-type musician, with long hair and a
    scruffy beard._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, hello, Leon.
       **Leon:** Hey, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:**[_shaking his hand_] Lovely to meet you.  Listen, why don't you
             help yourself to the refreshment table there.  I need to have
             a few words with Roz.
    
    _Leon moves away._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, we've got a problem!  In scoring this, I had to eliminate
             the guitar part.
        **Roz:** Well, put it back.
    **Frasier:** Well, I can't.  I'm afraid another instrument might make 
             Things sound cluttered... unless, of course, Leon can play 
             the bagpipe.
        **Roz:** The bagpipe?
    **Frasier:** Yes!  Our show deals with a whole range of human emotion from
             euphoria to despair, and nothing says despair so quickly as 
             the skirl of a bagpipe.
        **Roz:** Nothing says "Turn off the radio" so quickly either.  Isn't 
             there something else he can play?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh... yes, yes!  Actually, our triangle player called in 
             with a touch of tinnitus.  Here we are.
    
    _Leon returns._
    
    **Frasier:** Leon, I have some good news for you.  I had to eliminate the 
             Guitar part, but I'm promoting you to first triangle.
    
    _He hands him the triangle and its beater._
    
       **Leon:** Uh, I've never played one of these.  It looks tricky.
    
    _Frasier stares agape at Roz._
    
        **Roz:** I'll work with him.
    **Frasier:** Yes, off you go.
    
    _They move to the percussion section._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, then, now people, before we start, are there any 
             questions?
    
    _The principal violist raises her hand._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, viola.
    **Tiffany:** My name is Tiffany.
    **Frasier:** No, no no.  I'm calling you by your instrument name, so as to 
             avoid confusion.
    **Tiffany:** Oh, well I have a question about measure 34...
    **Frasier:** Ah... I thought you might.  Yes, you see, I've accelerated the 
             tempo there in order to depict the yearning of the superego.  
             Very perceptive of you to spot that.
    **Tiffany:** No, I meant, are these eighth notes or what?
    **Frasier:**[_miffed_] Yes... eighth notes.  Anyone else?
    
    _The timpanist raises his hand._
    
      **Frasier:** Yes, timpani?
      **Tiffany:** You just answered my question.
      **Frasier:** Not Tiffany, timpani.
    **Timpanist:** What are we rehearsing this for?  Are we going to record it?
      **Frasier:** Yes, actually, we are waiting for the final go-ahead from my
               station manager, and then we will be recording it, yes.
               Anyone else?
    
    _Niles raises his hand._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes... actor.
      **Niles:** I'm just wondering how my monologue is going to be audible
             over all these instruments.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's a good point, Niles. [_beat_] You may be seated.
             [_after Niles sits_] It is imperative that everyone play
             [_pianissimo_] during the spoken portions - very, very
             softly.  That applies particularly to brass and timpani.
    **Tiffany:** Why me?
    **Frasier:**[_incredulous at her dimness_] To the drums, Tiffany.
    
    _Martin and Daphne enter._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, Daphne, I'm so glad you came!
    
    _He embraces them._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, well, after all, it is the world premiere of your theme 
             song.
    **Frasier:** Now, I don't have to search you two for any hidden recording
             devices, do I?  The last thing I need is some bootleg CD's
             flooding the marketplace.
     **Martin:** Boy, you really got everything here!
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's not a time for stinting, Dad.  I've got everything
             from the African rain stick to the Javanese tam-tam.
     **Martin:**[_at the refreshment table_] Are the tam-tams the long ones
             with the cream in the middle?
    
    _Kenny enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Kenny, Kenny!  I'm so glad you made it.  Listen, I think
             you're in for a bit of a surprise.
      **Kenny:** Well, I gotta tell you, I don't surprise easily. [_seeing the
             orchestra_] Whoa!
    **Frasier:** Our little ensemble.  Heh-heh.
      **Kenny:** So many musicians... all working on a weekend.
    
    _Kenny checks his watch._
    
    **Frasier:** Now, listen, I realize that we are a bit over budget, and I
             promise, I will pick up the difference myself.
    
    _Kenny sits._
    
    **Frasier:** All right.  The time has come to unveil my magnum opus.  Just 
             Let me do a little fine-tuning on the opening fanfare. 
    
    _He moves to the podium._
    
    **Frasier:** Uh, brass, if you will please, in four, the first measure?
    _Frasier beats out a preparatory measure in 4/4.  The trumpets play a
    very conventional fanfare flawlessly._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, you see, that's fine as far as it goes, but this time 
             I want you to do it with a bit more... grandeur.  With some 
             majesty and a soupcon of awe.
    _The trumpets play the fanfare exactly as before.  Frasier turns to 
    Kenny, Martin, Daphne, and Roz, who are seated behind him._
    
    **Frasier:** There, you see.  That's what good conducting can do.
    
    _Kenny gets a puzzled, concerned, incredulous look on his face._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, everyone.  The time we have been waiting for is at
             hand.  And with a simple bow of thanks to the muse Calliope,
             let us begin.  And...
    _The four audience members exchange a look of incredulity, not knowing
    what to expect.  The maestro raises his baton, and we hear his magnum
    opus.
    
    He conducts a preparatory measure again, and the trumpets play the 
    fanfare.  This is followed by the strings, who settle into a 
    conventional broadway-style vamp that doesn't seem to "fit" the 
    preceding fanfare.  After a harp glissando, the first chorus is then 
    presented by three soloists and the choir._
    
    CHORUS 1
    **Soloist 1:** (tenor)   _Who can you turn to for prompt diagnosis?_
    **Soloist 2:** (soprano) _A fetish or fantasy_
    **Soloist 3:** (bass)    _Sex or psychosis_
    **Soloist 1:**           _No problem at all, let us handle your call_
    **Choir:** (unison)  _On our show!  On our show!_
    
    _Prominent drum beats accompany "On our show!"  Martin exchanges a
    glance with Daphne and Roz._
    
    CHORUS 2
    **Soloist 2:**         _Bring us your traumas, your latent neurosis_
    **Soloist 1:**         _Erectile disfunction (the "r" prominently rolled)_ 
    **Soloist 3:**         _Bed-wetting narcosis_
    **Soloist 1:**         _There's no need for shame, you can use a false name_
        **Choir:**(unison) _On our show!  On our show!_
    _Frasier is delighted with the performance thus far.  The orchestra now
    settles down to a suspenseful and quietly sustained chord.  The musical
    material of the choruses is very clich ed Broadway/Disney-style fare, so
    the suspenseful film-score background chords and the overly dramatic
    delivery of Niles's following monologue is extremely incongruous:_
    
      **Niles:**[_rising_] Who dares enter the dark labyrinth of the human mind?
    _A percussion player draws a string bow across a metal object, producing
    an unpleasant whining sound.  The orchestra changes harmonies to a
    higher chord.  Frasier marks time with dramatic baton gestures as he
    prepares to cue the harmonic changes._
    
      **Niles:** What festering secrets are buried in the recesses of the
             subconscious?
    _Another percussionist drags something across a gong, producing another
    unpleasant sound._
    
      **Niles:** Lurid images!
    _Another harmonic shift upward comes with Niles's words, which are
    followed by the shaking of a circus-style rattle/whistle._
    
      **Niles:** Lewd desires!
    _Yet another chord shift with Niles's line, followed by a slide whistle,
    which presumably illustrates the "lewd desires."_
    
      **Niles:** Guilty pleasures!
    _A chord shift with Niles again, and a "grunting" sound from the 
    orchestra._
      **Niles:** Strange compulsions!
    _One more harmonic shift with Niles, followed by a dissonant trombone
    splat.  Niles, startled, stares at the trombone player.  The strings 
    then play a quick rising transitional passage, leading to a suspenseful
    high note._
    
      **Niles:** The whole catalogue of human behavior from the aberrant to the
             monstrous lurks behind a locked door to which one man holds
             the key!
    _A huge beat of the gong (tam-tam), which startles the others, 
    Particularly Martin... and then a harp glissando leads us back 
    seamlessly to the broadway-style chorus music.  Niles sits, 
    grinning broadly._
    
    CHORUS 3
    **Soloist 1:** (tenor)  _So if you are stymied to find a prognosis_
    **Soloist 2:** (soprano)_And ask yourself, just like Freud:_
    **Soloist 3:** (bass)   _"Himmel, was los ist?"_
    
    _Frasier is particularly delighted with the German line._
    
    **Soloist 1:**          _Stop scratching your head, let us cure it instead_
    
    _Daphne and Roz chuckle._
    
        **Choir:** (unison) _On our show!  On our show!_
    _The little instrumental riff before "On our show!" is different in the
    three choruses.  The following coda sounds as if it has been directly
    lifted from "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" from "Mary Poppins."_
    CODA
    **Choir:** (single note)_Now here is the man to explain
                        The tortured terrain of your brain
                        The man who feels everyone's pain...
                        Dr. Crane!  Dr. Crane!  Frasier Crane!!_
    _The choir finally harmonizes on the last "Crane."  Leon's triangle
    has been featured prominently in the last shouts of "Dr. Crane."
    The final chord is drawn out in another broadway clich e, and after
    the cutoff, Leon provides a final triangle beat.  Frasier lowers
    his baton, extremely proud of his opus.
    _
    [_N.B. The piece can be heard on the "Frasier" soundtrack CD._]
    
        **Roz:**[_the only person applauding_] Way to go, Leon!
    _Daphne begins to applaud with hesitation.  Martin is mystified.  
    Kenny has an indescribable look of amazement and sits motionless._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Kenny.  What's your reaction?
    _Kenny's facial expression remains frozen and he is motionless.  
    Finally:_
    
      **Kenny:**[_hushed_] Wow.
    **Frasier:** Takes your breath away, doesn't it?
      **Kenny:**[_again_] Wow.
    **Frasier:** I thought as much, and in anticipation of your approval, I had
             the forethought to order in a little bubbly.  Niles, if you
             would help me, please?
    _Niles joins Frasier and they run toward a backstage room, delighted._
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] Oh, you were wonderful!
      **Niles:** Thank you, the trombone frightened me.
    
    _They exit._
    
      **Kenny:**[_again, the same_] Wow.
     **Martin:** Well that was sure something, wasn't it?
     **Daphne:** I'll say.  Sort of like Gilbert and Sullivan -- only 
             frightening.
      **Kenny:** A little jingle, that's all we wanted.  Yeah, ten seconds to
             start the show.
        **Roz:**[_trying to mediate_] Well, maybe Frasier can cut this down...
      **Kenny:**[_cutting her off_] He gives me harps and drums and... people
             speaking German.  All we wanted was a simple little jingle.
    
    _Martin rises and gets some refreshments._
    
     **Daphne:** Probably more like the one you came up with.  Tell him yours,
             Mr. Crane.
     **Martin:** No, no, no, it was nothing.  I can't even remember how it 
             goes.
     **Daphne:** Well, I do. [_singing:_]
             _How are you?  I'm listen..._
     **Martin:** No, it doesn't go like that.
      **Kenny:** Well, then you sing it, Mr. Crane.
     **Martin:** Well, all right... but it's really nothing.
    
    _He moves in front of them and sings his jingle:_
    
     **Martin:**_What's new?  I'm listenin'
             Feelin' blue?  I'm listenin'..._
             Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad
             I'm listenin'!_
      **Kenny:** That's exactly the kind of thing we're looking for!
    
    _Frasier and Niles re-enter over Kenny's speech._
    
      **Kenny:** You know, it sets the mood, it - it says it all.  Did that
             just pop into your head?
    **Frasier:**[_coming up behind him and handing him a glass_] Hardly.  It was
             gut-wrenching, but you know, it's nice to know that I made it
             look easy.
    
    _He continues to hand out glasses of champagne._
    
      **Kenny:** No, no, no.  I'm talking about your dad's little jingle.
    
    _Martin beams._
    
    **Frasier:**[_taken aback_] Dad's?
      **Kenny:** Yeah, he just sang it.  It's exactly the type of thing we 
             need.  You know, simple, catchy...you know, we ought to 
             just use that one.
    
    _Martin seems okay with this._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no, Kenny, no.  I mean, if simple is what you wanted, 
             you should have just said so.
      **Kenny:** I thought I did.
    **Frasier:** Well, obviously not.  Now that I know what you want, well, 
             there's nothing easier.  Of course I can write simple.  I
             promise you, it'll be something far more memorable than what
             my dad came up with.
      **Kenny:** Well, I don't know, I remember it..._sings_
             _What's new?  I'm listenin'_
    
    _Some of the choir members, including the soloists and director, take
    up the jingle._
    
      **Choir:**_Feelin' blue?  I'm listenin'...
             Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad
             I'm listenin'!_
    **Frasier:**[_indignant and humiliated_] You're off the clock!
    
    _He exits in a huff.  
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **IT'S WHY GERSHWIN'S TEETH WERE IMMACULATE**
    
    _Scene 6 - Frasier's apartment
    He is seated at the piano playing some ornate classical-style
    improvisation.  He breaks it off and plunks out the last two lines
    of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."  He places his head in his hand in
    frustration.  Martin enters in his robe._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.  How's it goin'?
    **Frasier:** "Merrily, merrily."
     **Martin:** Well, you know, it's getting kind of late.  Maybe you should
             call it a night, huh?
    **Frasier:** Dad, you heard Kenny.  I have to come up with something as
             simple as yours by Monday.  By the way, thanks once again
             for completely upstaging me today.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, I'm sorry I stole your thunder, but it's not like
             I did it on purpose.
    **Frasier:** I know.  I know.  I'm sorry.  It's just... I don't know why 
             I'm having such a hard time with this.
     **Martin:** Well... maybe you're just thinking too much.  I mean, look 
             at me.  I go to the bathroom, I'm flossing my teeth, and that 
             song pops into my head.
    
    _Martin sits at the dining table._
    
    **Frasier:** Are you suggesting that I bring out a spool of floss?
     **Martin:** Well, it might not be a bad idea, for a couple of reasons.
    
    _Frasier joins him at the table._
    
     **Martin:** Frasier, why don't you just decide what you want to say and 
             Say it?  Not a lot of big words and showing off.  You know, 
             and the tune should be something simple - something you can 
             whistle.  I tried whistling that thing you wrote today, and 
             I got lightheaded.  Of course, it might have been that last 
             doughnut.  I went back for one of those African rainsticks.  
             Ooh...
    
    _He gestures with mild disgust._
    
    **Frasier:** The truth is, Dad, I've... I'm not sure I can do simple.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know if you can't or if you just don't want to.
             And you know, some of the best things in the world are simple,
             Fras.  Just like that art gallery you took me to a couple of
             months ago.  Do you remember?  You were oohing and ahhing at
             this painting of a big red dot.
    **Frasier:** Yeah, Dad, but there is a difference between simple and
             deceptively simple.
     **Martin:** Well, all I'm saying is that it's fine to be smart, but you
             shouldn't have to be proving it all the time, that's all.  You
             know, just as an experiment, tell me what it is you're trying
             to say stripped down to nuts and bolts.
    **Frasier:** All right, um... in my first stanza, I want to represent 
             myself as the... ombudsman between the conscious and 
             subconscious minds of my listeners.
     **Martin:** Ah.  Well, there you are, that's the song right there.  All we
             need is a rhyme for "ombudsman" and we can go to bed.
    **Frasier:** Well, I was playing around with "north woodsman."
    
    _Martin laughs gently._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, Frasier.  Look, I'm going to tell you what your show's 
             about: People have a problem, they're feeling low, they call 
             you, you make them feel better.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, Dad.
     **Martin:** Well, that's it!  That's it.  Why don't you just write about 
             that?
    **Frasier:** How would that sound exactly? [_He recites:_]
             _If you've got a problem
             If you're feelin' low
             Lookin' for some answers..._
             Oh, gosh, now I'm stuck.  How will I ever find a rhyme for 
             "low"?
     **Martin:** Okay, smart-aleck.  I was just trying to help.
    **Frasier:** Well, thanks, Dad.  I'm sorry, you know, it's just not my 
             thing.
     **Martin:** Okay, well, I'm going to bed.  So, if you need any help 
             tomorrow, all you got to do is ask.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.
    _Martin exits toward his bedroom.  Frasier returns to the piano, waits
    until he is gone, and sits.  He begins to plunk out a catchy melody
    and sings to it:_
    
    **Frasier:**_If you've got a problem...
             If you're feelin' low
             Lookin' for some answers..._
     **Martin:**[_completing the verse rhyme and tune from offstage:_]
             _Things you need to know_
    
    _Frasier looks up, mildly indignant.  FADE immediately to...
    
    Scene 7 - KACL
    We hear a catchy introduction, and then then Frasier's tune, sung
    in Andrews Sisters-style harmony by a group of female vocalists.
    Kenny, Roz, and Frasier are leaning over the desk listening to the
    recorded song._
    
    **Vocalists:**_If you've got a problem
               If you're feelin' low
               Lookin' for some answers
               Things you need to know,
               All you've got to do is ask
               (tempo slows) All you've got to do is ask._
    
    _A triangle dings to end the song.  Frasier, Kenny, and Roz have been
    bouncing to the catchy jingle, and Frasier is proud of it, simple as
    it is.  
    
    FADE OUT
      
    END OF ACT II_
     
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier turns on his stereo and takes out his baton.  He begins to 
    conduct.  Eddie enters and sits on Martin's chair.  Eddie begins to 
    "sing" and Frasier continues to conduct.  Eddie seems to respond to 
    the baton.  Frasier is delighted and continues to beat time.
