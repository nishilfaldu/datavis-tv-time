    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_  
    _Daphne opens the door, Niles is there._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne. [_He enters._] Is Dad around?  I have that 
             videotape he wanted to see.
     **Daphne:** Actually, he's gone off with Donny.  They went to a tractor 
             pull.
      **Niles:** Ohhh... [_He looks questioningly at her._]
     **Daphne:** As I understand it, they attach a large weight to a tractor 
             and see how far they can pull it through the mud.
      **Niles:** Ohhh... [_His brow furrows._]
     **Daphne:** The answer to your next question is "Beats the hell out of 
             me."
    
    _Frasier enters.  He is unshaven._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Daphne, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane.  I see you've grown yourself a crumb-catcher.
    **Frasier:** Oh, please.  Spare me your jocular euphemisms.  I've heard 
             them all from Freddie: my chin-sweater,  my face-fuzz, my 
             hickey-hider.
      **Niles:**[_laughing_] Well, I think it suits you.
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you, Niles.  I just wanted to shake things up a 
             bit, you know.
      **Niles:** How was Boston?
    **Frasier:** Oh, it was fine.  It was great seeing Freddie again.  Of 
             course, Lilith was insufferable.  She's got a new boyfriend, 
             some twenty-eight year old named Marcel, he's a contortionist 
             with the Cirque de Soleil.
      **Niles:** She's dating French circus folk?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Well, he's actually perfect for Lilith: he has no 
             apparent spine and she can wrap him around her finger.  
             Of course, Lilith's smug satisfaction was a little hard 
             to bear, though.  Especially considering how long it's 
             been since the circus came to my town.
    
    _Martin and Donny enter._
    
      **Donny:** I know!  I couldn't believe the weight of that thing!  
             [_spotting Frasier_] Well, it's Grizzly Crane!
     **Martin:** Well, nice soup-strainer there, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
      **Donny:** Oh, we just saw a hell of a tractor pull.  Even you would 
             have liked it.
     **Martin:** So, how's my grandson?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he's great, Dad.  Actually, he loved the baseball mitt 
             you sent him.
      **Donny:**[_taking off the ball cap he's wearing_] Where's Daphne?  
             I got this little gift for her.
      **Niles:** Oh, a John Deere cap.  How... could you?
    
    _The doorbell rings, Frasier goes to get it._
    
      **Donny:** Oh no, I'm just giving it to her to see her pretend to like 
             it.  Then I'm gonna give her a bracelet.
    
    _He goes off to Daphne's room.  Frasier answers the door to reveal 
    Roz._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi Roz.
        **Roz:** Hmmm, cool beard!  
    **Frasier:** Oh, thanks!
        **Roz:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:**[_handing Frasier an envelope_] OK, here's the directions, 
             hotel confirmation and schedule.
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?
        **Roz:** Broadcast conference.
    **Frasier:** Good lord!  I thought that was next week.
        **Roz:** No, it's tonight!  I'm going up there right now.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, Roz.  I just got back from Boston, for God's sake.  
             You know, maybe I could just drive up tomorrow and attend 
             the panels.
        **Roz:** No Frasier, tonight's reception's the most important part!  
             It sets the tone for the whole weekend.
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on!  Last year everybody just got drunk and acted 
             like a bunch of horny teenagers.
        **Roz:** Exactly!  So stop yakkin' and start packin'!
      **Niles:** Well, you know, it could be just the relief you need after 
             a long week with Lilith and Le Pretzel Boy.  
    
    _Roz looks disturbed as she sits in Martin's chair._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, come to think of it, there was one really 
             gorgeous blonde up there: Rush Hour Rita, Larame's Eye 
             in the Sky.
        **Roz:** Yeah, I remember her.  The traffic was bumper to bumper 
             outside her ROOM.
    **Frasier:** Meow, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, it's just that I am so sick of men becoming panting 
             idiots just at the sight of blonde hair.  
      **Niles:** That is a bit of an oversimplification, Roz.
    **Frasier:**[_At the same time as Niles, then continuing alone_] Don't 
             be ridiculous.  It's insulting, Roz!  For God's sake, I 
             mean, every man's taste is different.
    
    _Martin comes in from kitchen._
    
        **Roz:** Sorry, it's just that I met this guy at Nervosa today for 
             coffee and it was very annoying.  Every time I tried to say 
             anything, this blonde waitress would walk by...
     **Martin:** Oh, Mimi's back?
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's good news.
      **Niles:** Gotta stop in and see Mimi.  
    
    _Roz flounces back in the chair, disgusted._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I guess I better get packing!   
     **Martin:** What're you talking about?  You got your bags right there.
    **Frasier:** No, Dad, these are my "Daddy" clothes.  I have to go and 
             pack my "Come to Daddy" clothes.
    _Donny and Daphne come from her room.  Daphne is wearing the cap, 
    Donny is on the phone._
      **Donny:** Oh, will you give me a break?  All right, all right! 
             [_Disconnects._]  My surveillance guy just cancelled for 
             tonight, just when I need him for this big money divorce 
             case.
     **Daphne:** Is this the Stanley Redmond thing?
      **Donny:** Yeah, the dumpster rental king.  This guy controls half the 
             dumpsters in the Northwest, his wife thinks he's been taking 
             out the wrong kind of trash.  You know, if I can prove it, 
             this case is mine.
      **Niles:** That is so depressing.  You expect this sort of behavior 
             from a mattress king, but we ask more of our dumpster 
             royalty.
      **Donny:** Yeah, but you should see this girlfriend: leggy, blonde...
      **Niles:**[_to Roz_] Oh, well, blonde!  That explains it!
        **Roz:**[_getting up in a huff_] Goodbye.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry. [_She leaves._]
      **Donny:** Hey, wait a minute.  Marty?  You were a cop, right?  You 
             must've done surveillance.
     **Martin:** Oh sure, all the time.
      **Donny:** Well, why don't you work for me tonight?  It's forty-five 
             bucks an hour.
      **Niles:** Oh, I don't think Dad would want to do that.
     **Martin:** Forty-five bucks?
      **Donny:** All right, fifty.  But if you get a picture of Redmond and 
             the girl, then it's a five hundred dollar bonus.
     **Martin:** Five hundred dollars?
      **Donny:** All right, seven hundred, you're killing me.
      **Niles:** Dad, I don't think this is a good idea.  Where exactly is 
             this stakeout?
      **Donny:** It's at the Alcazar apartments.  You know, in Belltown.
      **Niles:** Belltown is sort of a sketchy neighborhood, wouldn't you say?
     **Martin:** Oh Niles, to you a sketchy neighborhood is when the cheese 
             shop doesn't have valet parking.  I'm an ex-cop, remember? 
      **Niles:** Yeah, yeah, I know you're an ex-cop.  Let's just examine 
             this, Dad...
     **Martin:** No, no, no.  Let's just forget about it.  I'm not gonna 
             listen to this all night.  I just won't do it, are you 
             satisfied?
      **Niles:**[_getting up to leave_] Yes.  Thank you.  Donny, I'm sorry 
             to put a crimp in your plans.
      **Donny:** No, that's all right.  I'm sure I'll find somebody else.  
             [_as the door closes on Niles, he turns to Martin_] You're 
             still doing it, right?
     **Martin:** Hell, yes!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene 2 - Roz's Hotel Room._  
    _Roz is on the phone, wearing a very revealing dress._
    
        **Roz:** Thanks for watching Alice, Laurie.  I really owe you one...  
             Well, I just want to get down to this cocktail party before 
             all the good men are taken... What?  I just want to have a 
             little fun tonight... No!  I do not mean that... All right, 
             I do mean that. [_There is a knock at the door._] Uh, Laurie, 
             I'll talk to you later.  Thank you again, bye-bye.
    
    _She hangs up and opens the door.  It is Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, hey Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Hi Roz.  My room isn't ready yet, can I put my stuff here 
             until I can check in?
        **Roz:** Come on in.
    **Frasier:** Thanks.  I tell you, the storm hasn't dampened the festivities 
             downstairs.  It's only seven o'clock and Marge Whitmeyer is 
             already in the bar arm-wrestling people for drinks.
        **Roz:** How many did you buy her?
    **Frasier:** Well, three, but my elbow was in a wet spot.
        **Roz:** Hey, did you happen to notice if that weather guy from KSGY 
             was down there?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I noticed that he was there.  Something tells me the 
             forecast calls for a collision between two warm fronts.
    _Roz grins at him and arches her eyebrows.  The phone rings and Roz 
    gets it._
    
        **Roz:** Hello?  Oh, yeah, he's here. [_hands the phone to Frasier_] 
             It's the front desk.
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Yes?  Well then, you'll just have to get me a room 
             elsewhere!  I see.  Thank you very much. [_he hangs up_] They 
             don't have a room for me.
        **Roz:**[_looking nervous_] What're you gonna do?
    **Frasier:** Well, guess I could stay on the couch. 
        **Roz:** What!?
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on Roz!  I got no choice!  The whole island is 
             booked.
        **Roz:** Well, this is sure gonna cramp my style.  I mean, it's not 
             like college when everybody just... never mind.
    **Frasier:** You know Roz, we're two attractive people.  We're at a 
             conference that turns into a bacchanal every year, odds 
             are neither of us will need this room tonight.
        **Roz:** You're right.  What's the problem?
    **Frasier:** I believe there's a cocktail party awaiting us?
        **Roz:** Let's go down together.  [_taking his arm_]  We'll be like 
             jackals, they hunt in pairs.
    **Frasier:** I like your self-assurance.  There's no greater aphrodisiac 
             than confidence.
        **Roz:** Shall we?
    **Frasier:** Let the games begin!
    
    _They exit.  Moments later, they come back in._
    
        **Roz:** I just need a little more lipstick.
    **Frasier:** I'm sweatin' right through this shirt.
    
    _FADE OUT
    
    End of Act 1
    
    Act 2_  
    **FORGET IT MARTY, 
    IT'S BELLTOWN**
    _Scene 1 - A Surveillance Van.
    Marty is sitting in the passenger's seat, watching a building with 
    binoculars.  Niles comes to the driver's side.  Seeing Martin, he 
    glares and bangs on the door._
    
     **Martin:**[_opening the door_] Niles...
      **Niles:** You specifically promised me...
     **Martin:** Would you shut up and get in here?
    
    _Niles climbs in._
    
     **Martin:** How did you know I was here?
      **Niles:** The doorman!
     **Martin:** Bigmouth.
      **Niles:** Well, I guess he didn't realize he was being sworn to secrecy 
             when you said "Hey Sid, I'm goin' on a stakeout."  I can't 
             believe you lied to me.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm sorry, but you were makin' such a big fuss about
             nothing.
      **Niles:** It is not nothing!  Look at this neighborhood. [_looking in 
             the side-view mirror_] I'm not even happy parking my Mercedes 
             here.
     **Martin:** It's not that bad.
      **Niles:** Oh, really?  Well then could you explain to me the ominous 
             group of men standing back there in the shadows by my car?  
             [_Martin looks out the back._] They're all wearing the same 
             sort of dark coat, it's some sort of gang.
     **Martin:** Niles, they're Hasidic Jews.
      **Niles:** That's right, keep walking, keep walking...
     **Martin:** So, what, you came down here to bawl me out?
      **Niles:** Yes... partly.  Also to give you this.  
    
    _He hands over a thermos._
    
     **Martin:** What's this?
      **Niles:** Clam chowder.
     **Martin:**[_happy_] Oh-ho!
      **Niles:** I remember Mom used to make it for you when you went ice 
             fishing, and I hated the thought of you sitting out here 
             cold and hungry.
     **Martin:** Well thank you, I appreciate it.  But, look, why don't you 
             just go back home, now.  I'll be fine.
      **Niles:** No, I'll just stay awhile, you could use the company.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, Niles, why don't you tell me what's really on 
             your mind?
      **Niles:** All right, Dad, I was worried about you.
     **Martin:** I knew it.  Because I'm an old man and I can't take care of 
             myself!
      **Niles:** No.  Age has nothing to do with it.  I've always worried 
             about you, that's what it's like when your father's a cop.  
             I worried about you when I was five years old.  And I didn't 
             stop worrying until the day you retired.  And today just 
             brought it all back again.
     **Martin:** Look, I'm sorry.  For what it's worth, I know what you mean.  
             My dad was a cop, too.
      **Niles:** I know.
     **Martin:** But, you know, Niles, I'm not chasin' after bad guys.  
             I'm just gonna take a picture.
      **Niles:** That's true.  I'm probably overreacting like usual.  Uh, 
             well I guess I'll head home.
     **Martin:** No, no, hey wait a little bit.  Stick around.  How'd you 
             like a little clam chowder?
      **Niles:** I'd love some!
     **Martin:**[_opening thermos_] OK! [_he sniffs_] This is clam chowder!
      **Niles:** Well, what'd you expect?
     **Martin:** Irish whiskey!  Your mother always filled it with coffee and 
             Irish whiskey!  We just called it clam chowder in front of 
             you kids.
      **Niles:**[_with a thoughtful look_] Is that why you got so mad that 
             day I crumbled oyster crackers in your thermos?
    
    _Martin makes a face and closes the thermos.  FADE OUT.
      
    Scene 2 - Roz's Hotel Room
    Roz is in her nightgown and robe, putting her hair up.  Frasier 
    comes in._
    
        **Roz:** What happened to you?
    **Frasier:** Same thing that happened to you... I got a hug goodnight.
        **Roz:** Where did we go wrong?  Rush Hour Rita was draping herself 
             all over you, and that news guy actually said to me if I 
             gave him twenty-two minutes he'd give me the world.
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know, Roz.  After he gave you the brush-off, 
             he came over and sat down next to me and Rita.  Before I 
             knew it, they had discovered their mutual fondness for tango 
             music.
        **Roz:** I lose out to tango music?  What a night!   A total bust!
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on, Roz.  You know, for my money, you were the 
             most attractive woman down there.
        **Roz:** Thanks, Frasier.  And I'm not just saying this to return 
             the favor, but you look really hot in that beard.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, thanks.  You know, maybe we're better off, just a 
             couple of old friends having a cozy evening together.
        **Roz:** Yeah, right. [_There is a knock at the door._] It's him!
    **Frasier:** It's her!
    
    _They rush to the door._
    
       Both: Come in, hello.  [_They open it to find a waiter._]
     **Waiter:** Sorry to disturb you, but the manager wanted to apologize 
             for the mix-up with the room. [_He puts down a champagne 
             bucket._] This is on us.
        **Roz:** That's nice.
    **Frasier:** Well, you in the mood for a glass of champers, Roz?
        **Roz:** I don't know, what do you think?
     **Waiter:** It won't fit in the mini-bar.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's settled then.  I can open it myself, thanks.  
             [_Tips him._] Here you are.
     **Waiter:** Thank you.  [_He leaves._]
    **Frasier:** Well, ah.  Demi-sec, respectable label, not a bad year.  
             We may just be having a better time than anybody else here.
    
    _From the room above comes the sound of tango music and dancing.  
    They both glower at the ceiling.  FADE OUT.
      
    Scene 3 - The Van
    Martin is watching the apartment house, Niles has a set of headphones 
    on, hooked to a parabolic dish mike._
    
      **Niles:**[_loudly_] Dad, this thing is amazing!  I can actually hear 
             some guy brushing his teeth!  Swish, swish, spit.  Swish, 
             swish... flossing!
     **Martin:** Niles!
      **Niles:** You have got to try this, it's incredible!  Here, put those 
             on... [_Hands Martin the headphones._]
     **Martin:**[_unenthused_]  All right.
      **Niles:**[_giving him the mike_]  All right, now point that anywhere 
             you want.
    
    _Martin takes the mike, but as he's moving it towards the window it 
    is pointed to the front of the van and Niles accidentally leans on the 
    horn._
    
     **Martin:** Aaaarrrrghh! [_He rips the headphones off._] Niles, will you 
             quit kidding around?  This isn't a game, it's a job!  I just 
             want to spot the guy, get a picture and get out of here.  So 
             why don't we just sit here and be quiet for a while.
      **Niles:** You know, Dad, are you sure you want to be doing this?
     **Martin:** I thought you said you weren't worried about me. 
      **Niles:** No, no, I'm not worried about your safety, I just mean are 
             you doing the right thing?  Meddling in this guy's marriage.  
             You know, speaking as a psychiatrist...
     **Martin:** Oh boy, open up a window.
      **Niles:** I just see this sort of thing in my practice all the time.  
             People make mistakes, and-and have affairs, and find some 
             way to fix it.  It's possible that by taking this picture, 
             you're destroying any chance this man has.
     **Martin:** Niles, the guy's a bum!  He's probably always been a bum.  
             Now, if you want to get into a debate about something, maybe 
             you can tell me what those grass clippings were doing in the 
             clam chowder.
      **Niles:** That was lemon grass, and Chef Andre has gotten high kudos 
             for that soup.
     **Martin:** Well, if kudos are those brown chewy things, he can have 
             'em.  I put mine in the ashtray.
    _He goes back to staring through the binoculars._
      **Niles:** You pretend to be such a cynic.  I think you agree with me.  
             You have too much of a conscience not to.
     **Martin:** Oh, bappity, bappity, bap.  Oh, there they are!  [_He grabs 
             the camera._]
      **Niles:** You're still gonna take this picture?
     **Martin:** Ho-ho, you're damned right I am!
      **Niles:** Even though right now that man may be planning to break it 
             off with his girlfriend tonight?  Planning to, to rededicate 
             himself to his marriage?  The terrible guilt spurring him on 
             to ever-greater depths of commitment, and, and, and years 
             from now he may be sitting with his wife, by the fire, 
             holding her hand, reflecting on all their wonderful years 
             together, especially their SUNSET years.  And you could 
             destroy all that with one click of a camera.
    
    _The camera clicks rapidly as Martin takes half a dozen shots._
    
     **Martin:** Sorry, Niles, what were you saying?
      **Niles:** You took a picture of that tree and you know it!
     **Martin:** All right, I did!  What'd you have to talk about all that 
             stuff for?
      **Niles:** I was just saying what you were already thinking.  You did 
             the right thing and you're not gonna to regret it.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well how am I going to tell Donny I just sat here and 
             watched them walk by and get in the car?
      **Niles:** You'll tell him proudly because you know in your heart of 
             hearts... 
    
    _There is a loud thunk behind them and a car alarm goes off._
    
     **Martin:** Whoa!  They backed into your Mercedes!
      **Niles:** I don't believe it!  They're not even leaving a note... 
             they're driving away!
     **Martin:** Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Niles.  They're probably 
             RACKED with grief and it'll spur them on to ever-greater...
      **Niles:** Oh shut up and take their picture!  Hurry up and get their 
             license number!  Hurry!  Hurry!
    
    _Martin grabs the camera and snaps away.  FADE OUT._
      
    **LIKE TWO SHIPS SINKING IN THE NIGHT**
    _Scene 4 - Roz's Hotel Room
    Roz and Frasier are sitting on the couch, drinking champagne.  
    Frasier has changed into his pajamas._
    
        **Roz:** Ummm, my longest relationship would have to be Ted, '88 to 
             '90.  No!  Derek, '89 to '92.
    **Frasier:** Being a gentleman, Roz, I won't point out the slight overlap 
             there.
        **Roz:** It's not an overlap, it's a transition.
    **Frasier:** Uh-huh.
        **Roz:** You know, like in April when you start wearing your spring 
             clothes, even though you're wearing your winter stuff?
    **Frasier:** Yeah, well, if we're talking April of '90, I doubt you were 
             wearing much of anything at all.
        **Roz:** OK, wise guy, what was your longest relationship?
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's easy, Lilith.  Although... [_he laughs_]
        **Roz:** What?
    **Frasier:** Well, if we're not talking romantic relationship, well, 
             then umm, my longest relationship with a woman would be 
             you: seven years.
        **Roz:** Loser!  [_They laugh._]  Seven years!
    **Frasier:** Gosh.
        **Roz:** My God, it has been that long.
    **Frasier:** It's worth toasting.
        **Roz:** Absolutely.  [_They clink glasses and take a sip._]  So 
             Frasier, what's with the beard?
    **Frasier:** You hate it.
        **Roz:** No!  Actually I like it.  It's like you're Frasier but not 
             Frasier.  What made you do it?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know.  I just wanted to change things a little, 
             I don't know, be spontaneous.
        **Roz:** Oh, my God, I almost did something like that this weekend.
    **Frasier:** Really?
        **Roz:** Yeah, I... Oh, hell, I'll show you!  [_She puts down her glass 
             and gets up, putting her hand on Frasier's leg._] Ooh, nice 
             silk pajamas. [_heading for the bathroom_] I made a little 
             purchase on my way up here.
    **Frasier:** Did you?  Well, I am just dying with anticipation.  What is 
             it?
        **Roz:** You promise you won't laugh?
    **Frasier:** I promise.
        **Roz:** OK.  Hold on one second.  I'll be right out!
    
    _She comes out of the bathroom, wearing a long, silky blonde wig._
    
        **Roz:** I just wanted to see for once in my life what it would be 
             like to be a blonde.  I thought I'd wear it down to the bar 
             one night.  Pretty pathetic, huh?
    **Frasier:** On the contrary, Roz.  It's, it's quite becoming.  It's 
             like you're Roz but not Roz.
        **Roz:**[_in a sultry voice_]  Hello stranger.  You here for the 
             conference?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I am.
        **Roz:** Is this seat taken?
    **Frasier:** It's been waiting for you all its life.  [_She sits next to 
             him._]  Champagne?
        **Roz:** Well, I'm not sure I should.  I already had one glass, and 
             it went straight to my head.  I feel like maybe I should 
             lie down.
    **Frasier:** You could use my room...
        **Roz:** Are you sure you're a gentleman?
    **Frasier:** Well, I do prefer blondes... [_They break up in laughter._]
        **Roz:** God, how many times have I had that conversation?
    **Frasier:** What would life be without the occasional surrender to 
             impulse?
        **Roz:** It's true, it does makes you feel alive.
    **Frasier:** Doing things you know you shouldn't do. 
        **Roz:** With people you shouldn't be with.
    **Frasier:** Right.  [_They look at each other._]
        **Roz:** Right.
    **Frasier:**[_putting down his glass_] You know, suddenly, this couch 
             seems a little small for me.
        **Roz:** Well the bed seems pretty big.
    **Frasier:** It's a big bed.
        **Roz:** It is.
    
    _Frasier takes her champagne glass and puts it down.  They look into 
    each other's eyes._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz...
    
    _He leans towards her.  She leans in and tilts her head...  There is 
    a loud knock at the door._
    
    **Frasier:** For God's sake!
    
    _He gets up and rushes to put on his robe, as she adjusts hers._
    
    **Frasier:** You all right?
    
    _Answering the door, he finds Kenny, the station manager._
    
    **Frasier:** Kenny!
      Kenny: I got stuck in the storm!  Now they don't have a room for 
             me.  I hear we're in the same boat, huh Doc?  Oh, hiya Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey.
      Kenny: Hey, cool wig!
        **Roz:** Thanks.
      Kenny: Hey, wait a minute, I'm not interrupting anything, am I?  
             Pyjamas, champagne, a fire... [_He winks broadly.  They all 
             laugh._]  So, anyhow, can I bunk here?
        **Roz:** Why not?  
    **Frasier:** No reason.
      Kenny: Great, great.  I really like that blonde hair, Roz.  You 
             better be careful though: get the doc here all hot and 
             bothered.  Ha ha.  [_Frasier and Roz laugh nervously._]  
             Well, just gonna get out of these wet clothes.  I had a 
             heck of a time gettin' here.  All these road look the same.  
             [_Frasier and Roz come together, looking into each other's 
             eyes again._]  I ended up taking a wrong turn...  The last 
             thing you want to do out here in these woods is take a 
             wrong turn.
    **Frasier:**[_as Roz turns away_] Quite right, Kenny.
    
    _Roz sits down._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I, I'm not sure the beard's really workin'.  
             I probably should shave it off.
        **Roz:** I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah.
    
    _She takes off the wig.  Kenny comes out of the bathroom wearing 
    pajamas and a nasal bandage._
    
      Kenny: I don't wear one of these snore strips, I'm a buzz saw 
             going through steel pipe.  So, ah, "Rock, Paper, Scissors" 
             for the sofa?
        **Roz:** I'll take it.
      Kenny: OK.  Looks like it's you and me in the bed, Doc.  
    **Frasier:** OK.
    
    _Roz turns off the lights._
    
      Kenny: [_climbing into bed_]  But I warn you, I'm a roller.  What 
             was I thinking, drinking all that coffee on the way up 
             here?  I'm gonna be up all night, I am WIRED.  [_He rolls 
             over, taking all the covers with him._]
    **Frasier:** Uh, Kenny, do you think you could, uh... [_Loud snores from 
             Kenny's side._]
        **Roz:**[_over the back of the couch as she settles down_]  Goodnight, 
             Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Goodnight, Roz.  
    _He turns out the last light._
    **Credits:**
     
    Kenny's nasal strip has fallen off.  Frasier looks for it, finally 
    finding it (hideously) on his own arm.  He puts it back on Kenny, 
    even pinching his nose shut.  Finally, he rolls over resignedly, and 
    Kenny throws his arm over Frasier.
