    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin enters the apartment with Eddie.  Daphne is on the sofa with 
    some video tapes.  Roz enters from the kitchen with a tray of wine._
        **Roz:** Hey, Martin.  Happy Valentine's Day.
     **Martin:** Oh thanks, Roz.  So you're with us tonight, huh?
        **Roz:** Yeah, we rented a couple of sad chick movies.
     **Martin:** Oh, it's not like you not to have a date on Valentine's Day.
        **Roz:** Tell me, I usually try for a second seating! [_Martin laughs_]
     **Daphne:** And you'd think that being engaged, I'd have a guaranteed  
             date.  But no!  Donny had to go to Florida, his grandmother.  
             She'd do anything to come between us.
     **Martin:** Oh, what did she do this time?
     **Daphne:** She died.
    _Frasier enters in his suit._
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, where is Niles?  I don't want to be late for the 
             opera.
        **Roz:** Are you going out with Niles on Valentine's Day?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a subscription series, you see.  We got these 
             tickets months ago, we had no idea what day this fell on.
     **Daphne:**[_hopeful_] So Dr. Crane's not spending tonight with Mel?
    **Frasier:** No, she's going out of town, some sort of medical conference. 
             [_doorbell sounds_] You know, actually I'm sorry for Niles, 
             but I'm rather glad to be having an old-fashioned boy's night 
             out.
    _Frasier opens the door to Niles on his cell phone._
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] I can't wait either, I'll see you in twenty 
             minutes, Valentine. [_kisses into phone and hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** That had better be the seat duster in our opera box!
      **Niles:** No, it was Mel.  At the last minute she decided to skip her 
             conference.
    **Frasier:** So, I'll be going to the opera by myself?
      **Niles:** Oh, well here's a thought.  If you give Mel your opera ticket 
             then you won't have to be alone.  You can stay here and watch 
             fun movies with Roz and Daphne. [_looks at titles_] Ooh, "Dying 
             Young" - it's a... classic.
    **Frasier:** I am surprised by your gall!  At the last moment you not only 
             bail on me, you expect me to give up my own ticket!
      **Niles:** Please, Frasier, put yourself in my shoes.  I have to do 
             something for Mel.  Every restaurant in town's been booked 
             for weeks.  I ran into Archie Wilfong today.  He told me he 
             had to settle for two seats at the counter at "The Salad 
             Experience!"  What would you suggest I do?
    **Frasier:** Bring your own wine and order the Spicy Caesar!
      **Niles:**[_stalks to the door_] May your opera box be full of cellophane 
             crinklers and the stage swarming with standbys.
    **Frasier:** Get out!
    _Niles leaves, slamming the door._
    **Frasier:** He goes too far!
        **Roz:**[_sarcastic_] Yeah, some nerve - ditching you to spend 
             Valentine's Day with his girlfriend.
     **Martin:** Look, Fras, I don't blame you for being a little jealous cause 
             he's got someone and you don't...
    **Frasier:** I am not jealous, Dad, I'm simply appalled by his rudeness.  
             I was looking forward to this evening. [_pouring himself a
             sherry_] Nice drink, lovely opera.  Then a late supper, perhaps 
             a beautiful bottle of wine, delightful desert souffle... 
             Oh God, I need a woman.
     **Daphne:** Remember my friend Rowena?  She's much prettier since her 
             surgery!  You look at her face and you can't even tell where 
             it used to be.
    
    [_N.B. In an earlier draft the line was, "you look at her face and can't 
    even tell where the extra one was."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Daphne.  But actually, I already have someone in 
             mind.  You see, there's a stunning woman who comes to the 
             opera on the same nights we do.  She has the box right across 
             from ours.  We've flirted a bit from a distance.  I have 
             laughed with her during "Figaro," cried with her during 
             "Tosca," I even had a dream about her during "Einstein On 
             The Beach."
        **Roz:** Well, don't just stare at her, make a move!
    **Frasier:** I will, Roz.  Tonight's the night.  By the finale I will have 
             made my overture.  Dad, would you please come with me? 
     **Martin:** To the opera?  What do you need me for?
    **Frasier:** Dad, I can't go with a woman because then she'll think I'm 
             on a date, and if I go alone she'll think I couldn't get a 
             date.
        **Roz:** He would look pretty pathetic.
     **Martin:** Oh, geez!
     **Daphne:** Or you could stay home with us and watch sad movies.
    **Frasier:**[_reads a title_] "Sophie's Choice."
     **Martin:** I'll say it is!
    _FADE OUT_
    **OUT WITH DAD**
    _Scene Two - Opera Box.
    Frasier and Martin are sat in the box._
     **Martin:** Is she here yet?
    **Frasier:** No, not yet.  That's her box over there, the empty one.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm not going to sit through a whole opera for some 
             woman who's not even here.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, Dad, give it a chance.  You might actually 
             learn to like it if you'd listen to one.
     **Martin:** Hey, your mother dragged to me a lot of these things when we 
             were dating and they were all stupid.  These stories make no 
             sense whatsoever.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that is not true! 
     **Martin:** Oh, all right, what's this one about?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's about Rigoletto, the hunchbacked jester in the 
             court of the Duke.  He has a daughter, Gilda, who's secretly 
             living with him.  But everyone thinks that she's his mistress.  
             In this opening scene, Rigoletto mocks the Duke's enemy, who 
             puts a curse on him.
     **Martin:** A cursed hunchback dating his daughter - well, nothing screwy 
             so far!
    **Frasier:** He is not dating his daughter!  Gilda is being courted by 
             the Duke, who is disguised as a humble student.
     **Martin:** You see, that's what I mean.  The whole thing's so unrealistic.  
             Everybody's in love, pretending to be somebody they're not.  
             And they're all swooning and gasping-
    _Frasier, looking over at the other box, gasps loudly._
     **Martin:** Exactly, who acts that way?
    **Frasier:** Dad, she's here!  She's here, and she's not on a date.  That 
             must be her mother.
     **Martin:**[_looks and gasps_] Wow, you're right, she is a looker all right. 
    **Frasier:** All right, don't gawk, don't gawk, she'll notice.
     **Martin:** Well, I thought that was the point.  You've got to get her 
             attention.
    _Martin begins waving until Frasier stops him._
    **Frasier:** No, Dad, please, don't wave!  Just keep your eye on the 
             stage.
     **Martin:** All right, but I bet you that gets results.
    _The opera begins and the lights dim.  Frasier and Martin applaud._
    **Frasier:**[_looks_] You're right, Dad, it did.
     **Martin:**[_looks and gasps in horror; through a clenched jaw_] Oh God, 
             I wasn't waving at her, I was waving at the daughter!
    **Frasier:** That's not what the mother seems to think. [_laughs_] I think 
             she likes you, wave back.
     **Martin:** No, I don't want to.
    **Frasier:** Wave back!  You started it, wave back to her.
     **Martin:** Oh, geez! [_reluctantly waves back_]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Theatre Lobby.
    Martin and Frasier arrive from the box._
     **Martin:** Hunchback's got kind of a nice voice, but the daughter's 
             kinda screechy!
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, she's no Renata Tebaldi.  Gosh, I don't see them, 
             do you?
     **Martin:** Oh, I bet you the old one's in the ladies room putting on 
             more war paint!
    _Frasier sees the two women coming towards them._
    **Frasier:** Here they are.  Just try to be nice, Dad!  If you are rude to 
             the mother you will ruin my chances with the daughter! [_they 
             come over_] Well, we finally meet.
      **Emily:** I feel like we're practically old friends.
      **Helen:** I'm Helen Browning, this is my daughter, Emily.
    **Frasier:** I'm Frasier Crane, this is my father, Martin.
    _They greet him._
    **Frasier:** Well, can we get you some champagne?
      **Emily:** Oh, we'd love it, thanks.
     **Martin:** Oh well, let me give you a hand.
    **Frasier:** No, no, you know what, Dad, we can manage.  Er, why don't you 
             two stay and have a nice little chat?
    _Frasier and Emily leave Martin and Helen alone._
    
      **Helen:** Lovely production, isn't it?  I adore Verdi.
     **Martin:** Oh, he's my favorite.
      **Helen:** Though the woman singing Gilda's a bit off.
     **Martin:** She's no Renata Tebaldi.
      **Helen:** You know, if you like Verdi so much, I happen to have a spare 
             ticket to "Aida" next week.
     **Martin:** Oh, that sounds great, but, er, if it's a week from tonight, 
             I'm busy, I'm sorry.
      **Helen:** Actually, it's next Thursday.
     **Martin:** Oh, Thursday?  Oh, you know there's this thing at my... at my 
             wine club.
      **Helen:** That's all right, Martin, we just met, I shouldn't have asked.
     **Martin:** No, no, no, Helen, it's got nothing to do with you, it's me. 
             I'm afraid I've given you the wrong impression of myself.  
             You see, the truth is, I'm... [_thinks_]
      **Helen:** Gay.
    
    _Beat._
    
     **Martin:** Uh, right, gay.
      **Helen:** I thought you might be.  How many straight men remember Renata 
             Tebaldi?
     **Martin:**[_looks over at Frasier_] Not many! [_laughs_]
      **Helen:** Well, I'm sorry if I was too forward, it's just that 
             sometimes it's so hard to meet nice men.
     **Martin:** Tell me! [_laughs_]
    _Frasier and Emily arrive with the champagne._
    **Frasier:** Here we are, Dad.  Actually, good news, Emily has agreed to 
             join me for a night cap after the opera.  Cast her eye over 
             my African art collection.
    _The bells sound for act two._
    **Frasier:** Oh, well...
      **Helen:** Very nice meeting you.
     **Martin:** Nice meeting you, too.
    **Frasier:**[_to Emily_] I'll see you later.
    _The Brownings depart for the stairs._
    **Frasier:** So how did it go with Helen?  You didn't offend her, did you?
     **Martin:** No, not at all.  It turns out I'm not her type.
    _Meanwhile, Helen and Emily chat._
      **Emily:** Well?
      **Helen:** Opera Queen.
      **Emily:** Oh, sorry. 
      **Helen:** Still, you know who he'd be perfect for?
      **Emily:**[_excited_] Yes!  You know, he's here tonight!  I'll bring him.
    _Frasier and Martin walk towards the exit._
    **Frasier:** Right, Dad, we better hurry up.  Don't want to miss the 
             second act.
     **Martin:** Oh, who cares?  It'll be just more goofy stuff that never 
             happens in real life.
    _Frasier and Martin exit._
    [_N.B. John Mahoney is, in real life, a big opera buff._]
    _End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Daphne and Roz are sobbing over a movie on the VCR as Frasier and 
    Martin enter.  Martin leaves to the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** How was the opera?
    **Frasier:** Lovely.  Get out! [_turns television off_]
        **Roz:** Hey, that movie's not over.
    **Frasier:** Too bad, Roz.  There's a stunning woman on her way over here, 
             I don't want her thinking I'm running some sort of maudlin 
             sorority house.  Now, come on, shake a leg.
        **Roz:**[_stands_] You actually spoke to her, you didn't wimp out?
    **Frasier:** You have never seen me so suave.
        **Roz:**[_goes to door_] Some Valentine's Day!  First my date bails on 
             me and now I owe Daphne fifty bucks! 
    _She exits, as Daphne exits to her room.  Frasier is not amused. 
    Martin enters holding his beer up._
    
     **Martin:**[_to his beer_] Well, hello there.  Will you be my "Ballantine"?
    **Frasier:** Dad, will you go get a glass, please?
     **Martin:** Oh, all right. [_exits to kitchen_]
    **Frasier:**[_doorbell sounds_] And drink it quickly.  The last thing I 
             need tonight is some third wheel cramping my style.
    _Frasier opens the door to Emily on the arm of a very English and very 
    camp Edward._
    [_N.B. Brian Bedford appeared in "Tales of the City" with Dan Butler._]
    
     **Edward:** Hello! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Hello.
      **Emily:** I hope you don't mind.  Edward here was at the opera too, 
             he's my partner.
    **Frasier:**[_miffed_] Your partner?
     **Edward:** At the gallery.  I'm also her uncle.
    **Frasier:** Oh, [_laughs_] when you said partner, I thought you meant 
             romantic partner.
     **Edward:**[_horse laughs_] Hardly!
    **Frasier:** I'm Frasier.
     **Edward:**[_enters_] Pleasure.  What a marvelous view! [_goes upstage_] 
             May I? 
    **Frasier:** Yes, please. 
    _Edward exits to the balcony._
      **Emily:** Your father, is he dating anyone at the moment?
    **Frasier:** Well, no, but if you're thinking about your mother, I'm 
             afraid they're not really right for each other.
      **Emily:**[_laughs_] Yes, I know.  I meant Edward.
    **Frasier:**[_surprised_] Your uncle?
      **Emily:** Yes.
    **Frasier:**...and my father?
      **Emily:** They're both single, they love opera and they were both 
             married with kids when they came out of the closet.  
             Your dad told my mother all about it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, did he?
      **Emily:** Well, she asked him out and he had to be honest with her.
    _Martin enters and notices Edward, who has just entered from the 
    balcony._ 
     **Martin:** Hi, there.
    **Frasier:** Yes, nothing like a little honesty to diffuse an awkward 
             situation.
    _Martin notices nothing unusual about Edward.  To the contrary, he's
    pleased to meet someone his own age._
     **Martin:** Hi there, how are you?
    **Frasier:**[_taking Emily's coat_] Let me take your coat.  Dad, this is 
             Edward, Emily's uncle, he's her partner in her art gallery. 
             Er, Edward, this is my father, Martin.
     **Edward:**[_shaking hands_] Pleased to meet you, Martin.
     **Martin:** Same here, and my friends call me Marty.
     **Edward:** Then Marty it is!  I love what you've done with this place, 
             it's the perfect blend of sleek elegance and [_pointedly at 
             chair_] audacious whimsy!
     **Martin:** Oh, you like it, huh?  Do you know, Edward's my favorite name. 
     **Edward:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yes, I even called my dog Eddie. [_calls_] Eddie! [_Eddie rushes 
             in_] Here he is.
      **Emily:** Oh, a Jack Russell!  He loves Jack Russells.
     **Edward:** I have three of them. [_to Eddie_] All girls.
     **Martin:** Oh, well, we ought to get them together.  Who knows, maybe a 
             little romance'll bloom. [_Edward reacts_]
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, maybe we should go fetch our new friends some 
             drinks.
      **Emily:** I'd love some white wine.
     **Martin:** How about you, Ed?
     **Edward:** Why not a beer?
     **Martin:** Oh, a man after my own heart. 
    _Edward, encouraged, trades a look with Emily.

    Frasier and Martin enter.  Frasier pours a glass of wine while Martin
    pours beer into a glass._
    **Frasier:** Boy, you are really something!
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** You actually told Emily's mother that you were gay.
     **Martin:** Well, you said not to offend her, I thought that was a pretty 
             good way to get her to cool her jets without hurting her 
             feelings.
    **Frasier:** Dad, there's something you don't understand.  You see, she 
             told Emily.
     **Martin:** She got a problem with it?
    **Frasier:** Oh no, she's pretty okay with it.
     **Martin:** Oh, I get it, you're worried she'll know I'm straight, 
             find out I've been lying to her mother.
    **Frasier:** Dad...
     **Martin:** Well, don't worry about it, I'll gay it up a little.
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Martin and Frasier enter the room with the drinks._
     **Martin:** Emily, have I told you I love your hair.
      **Emily:** Thank you, Martin.
     **Martin:** It's di-vine. [_sits on couch next to Edward_]
      **Emily:**[_looks at knickknacks_] Frasier, these pieces are wonderful, 
             you've exquisite taste!
     **Martin:** Oh, he gets that from me.  Yes, it was worth all the hours 
             I dragged him around to the museums and the antiques shops 
             teaching him about art and, you know... upholstery.
     **Edward:** Were you in the arts?
     **Martin:** Oh, well, actually, Ed-
    **Frasier:** Dad was a cop.
     **Edward:** Really? [_nudges him_] The, er, uniform and everything? [_laughs_]
     **Martin:** Yeah, in fact, er, that's what happened to my hip.  I took a 
             bullet trying to break up a robbery.  Yeah, I called for 
             back-up but it never showed up.
      **Emily:**[_sighs in sympathy_] Because you were gay.
     **Martin:**[_takes her hand_] Don't think I didn't wonder about that!
    _Frasier gives him a look._
     **Martin:** Yes, that was the day I came out. Lying in that alley, 
             covered with blood, bullet in my hip and I said, "That's it! 
             I'm gay, I like myself and I'm not living a lie anymore."
     **Edward:** I had exactly the same experience when I came out. 
    _Edward puts his hand on Martin's knee, to his surprise.  Martin's eyes 
    bug out as he looks at the hand, then to Frasier, then back to the hand 
    again.  Frasier just smirks at him._
     **Edward:** Not, exactly, perhaps.  Yours was a bullet in the hip.  For 
             me, it was a Lufthansa steward named Gunther.
      **Emily:**[_holds Frasier's hand_] What did I tell you?  I knew they'd 
             hit it off.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Yes, I had a feeling myself.
     **Martin:** And you didn't say a word, you scamp!  Er, Frasier, why don't 
             you come help me get some snacks for everybody?
    **Frasier:** All right, if you'll excuse us.

    Frasier and Martin enter and begin making snacks._
     **Martin:** You didn't tell me this was a set-up!
    **Frasier:** Well, how blind can you be, Dad?  He didn't seem gay to you?
     **Martin:** He's English, they all seem gay.
    **Frasier:** Lord!
     **Martin:** Well, we're just going to have to tell him the truth.
    **Frasier:** Oh, what?  You found her mother so unattractive you pretended 
             to be gay?!  Dad, Emily is the most fabulous woman I have met 
             in ages.  If you screw this up for me, I will never forgive 
             you, so just be nice, all right?
     **Martin:** But what if he asks me for a date?
    **Frasier:** I have news for you: You're on a date!
    _Reset to: Living Room
    They enter with the snacks to find Daphne chatting to the pair._
    **Frasier:** Daphne!
     **Edward:** We've just been chatting with your delightful physical 
             therapist, Marty.
     **Daphne:** Oh, he's a charmer, this one. [_Edward laughs modestly; to 
             Martin_] Now, aren't you glad you went to the opera? [_to Emily_] 
             I keep telling him he should get out more, meet people.  Most 
             nights he just sits here alone watching the telly.  
      **Emily:**[_re: Edward_] He's the exact same way.  He'll watch anything.
     **Daphne:**[_re: Martin_] With him it's mostly sports.  Just give him a 
             bunch of sweaty men chasing each other around the field and 
             he...
    **Frasier:** Daphne! [_drags her to the kitchen_] Where are we keeping the 
             Camembert these days?
     **Daphne:**[_protesting_] Same place we always do.
    **Frasier:**[_pushes her into kitchen_] Get in the kitchen!
    _Frasier and Daphne exit._
      **Emily:** You were smart to hire a woman for physical therapy.  Much 
             safer than a man.  Edward sprained his leg last year.
     **Edward:** All right, Emily.
      **Emily:** I never trusted that man.
     **Edward:**[_annoyed_] All right, Emily.
      **Emily:** And why you loaned him your boat...
     **Edward:**[_angry_] All right, Emily!
    _He chuckles weakly and shrugs at Martin.  Then from the kitchen they
    hear Daphne laughing herself silly.  Frasier enters with the cheese, 
    pretending he made a joke._
    **Frasier:** Here we are.
      **Emily:** Thank you, Frasier.  I would love to see the rest of the 
             apartment, if it's no trouble.
    **Frasier:** Why, that's no trouble at all.
    _The two walk to the corridor._
     **Martin:**[_worried_] Frasier, can I just...
    **Frasier:** Now, Dad, don't worry.  I will close the door to your room. 
             [_to Edward_] You should see it whenever he gets ready for the 
             opera - clothes everywhere!
    _Frasier and Emily exit.  Daphne enters, grinning._
    **Daphne:** Well, I'm off to bed.
    **Martin:** Oh, no, no, no, Daph.  Daphne, why don't you join us?
    **Daphne:**[_trying to contain her laughter_] Oh, no, no: Three's a crowd! 
            [_exits in a giggle_]
    _[_N.B. Daphne getting a bit of her own back, after Martin left her in 
    the exact same fix in[[2.03]](/frasier/transcripts/season_2/episode_3/the_matchmaker.html "The Matchmaker"), "The Matchmaker."_]
    
    Martin sits with Edward.
    _
     **Edward:** So.
     **Martin:** So...
     **Edward:** Our loved ones seem determined to thrust us together.
     **Martin:** Well, don't let them pressure you.
    _Martin is about to put his arm on the couch but then stops, realizing 
    it looks like a come-on._
     **Edward:** Congratulations, Marty, on having raised such a splendid son. 
             I envy you your bond. [_Martin gets nervous_]
     **Martin:** Do you have kids?
     **Edward:** Just one, George.  He's thirty-five and he has consecrated his 
             life [_in horror_] to bowling.  I join him when I can, but...
     **Martin:** You're not wild about it.
     **Edward:** No.  I mean, oh, the shoes!  Strange isn't it, the things 
             we'll do to be close to our children.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah.  I've let Frasier drag me to all kinds of places I 
             didn't want to go to, just so that I could spend some time 
             with him.  You know, sometimes it's hard to humor your kids 
             but...
     **Edward:**[_puts his arm on the couch_] It's what we do, we're fathers.
     **Martin:** Exactly. 
    _Both men are aware that a nice rapport has been established - 
    for Martin, uncomfortably so._
     **Edward:** Marty, would you be free for dinner sometime?
     **Martin:** Oh, gee, I, er...
     **Edward:** No, it's all right, never mind.
     **Martin:** No, no, no, I'd love to, it's just that...
     **Edward:** No need to explain.
     **Martin:** No, no, really.  It's not you, you're a great guy, it's just 
             that I'm... [_obviously contrived_] dating someone!
     **Edward:** Marty, you don't have to spare my feelings.
     **Martin:** No, no, really, it's true.
    _Niles enters with a bottle of wine._
      **Niles:** Hello.
     **Martin:** Darling! [_hugs Niles_]
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?
     **Martin:** Oh, not a thing, honey.  Just take off your coat and stay a 
             while.
      **Niles:** Okay. [_does so_] I felt bad about that squabble earlier so I 
             dropped off this little peace offering.
     **Martin:**[_takes wine_] As if I could stay mad at you.  Er, this is my 
             boyfriend, Niles.  Niles, this is Edward, we met at the opera
             tonight.
     **Edward:** Delighted.
      **Niles:**[_confused_] Hello.
     **Edward:** You needn't look so startled.  I can assure you, there's 
             nothing funny going on.
      **Niles:** Oh, good.
     **Martin:** Well, why don't we go put this on ice?
    _Martin takes his confused son in to the kitchen as Frasier and Emily 
    arrive chatting._
    **Frasier:** Of course the finest Gilda ever sung was by the great 
             Mathilde DeCagny.  I actually have a recording.
      **Emily:** I'd love to hear it.
    **Frasier:** Where's Dad?
     **Edward:** He's in the kitchen with his boyfriend.
    _Martin and Niles enter hand in hand._
    **Frasier:** Oh! [_confused_] Niles, what brings you here?
     **Martin:** Well, it's my place too! [_laughs_] I can have company if I 
             want.  Emily, this is Niles.
      **Emily:**[_coldly_] Hello.
      **Niles:** Hi.
      **Emily:**[_aside to Frasier_] Em, I didn't realize your father was seeing 
             someone.
    **Frasier:** No, actually, I didn't think he was.  Since when were you two 
             an item?
     **Martin:** Two weeks now.  We didn't say anything about it, yet, 
             because, well... [_looks at Niles for an excuse_]
      **Niles:** So many reasons.
     **Edward:** You know, it's getting late, Emily.
      **Emily:** Oh yes, we should be going.
    **Frasier:** No, no, please, please, stay for just five more minutes.  
             I have a very special old port that I'd love for you to 
             sample.
    _Frasier goes into the kitchen beckoning Niles.  Niles tries to go, 
    however he is stopped by Martin clinging on to him.  Niles whacks his 
    arm, freeing himself.  
    
    Reset to: Kitchen
    Niles and Frasier enter.  Frasier hurriedly pours three glasses of 
    port._
    **Frasier:** How can you do this to me?
      **Niles:** This was not my idea! 
    **Frasier:** Niles, Emily just kissed me in the bedroom and now she's 
             leaving.  I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
      **Niles:** You're embarrassed?!  They think the best I can do is an old 
             man with a cane!
    **Frasier:** You've got to fix this!
      **Niles:** Oh, and how am I supposed to do that?
    **Frasier:** Well, isn't it obvious?  You've got to dump Dad!
    _Niles and Frasier enter the living room and hand out the ports._
    **Frasier:** Here you are.  Really, you must try this.  So, Niles, 
             actually, you missed a splendid evening at the opera.
      **Niles:** Well, maybe I can catch it this weekend with Mel.
     **Martin:**[_"jealous"_] Oh, and who's Mel?
      **Niles:**[_"exploding"_] Damn you and your jealous questions, you don't 
             own me!
    _Niles walks to get his coat after being given a sign of approval from 
    Frasier._
     **Martin:** Niles, I was only asking!
      **Niles:**[_walks to door_] You're always asking, badgering, spying on me!  
             Well, I won't be suffocated anymore.  I'm tired of being your 
             trophy boy!  It's over, you hear me?  Over! [_haughty sniff_] 
             And I'm keeping the jewelry!
    _Niles exits, slamming the door behind him._
    **Frasier:**[_nearly laughing_] Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.
    
    _Martin gives him a look._
    
      **Emily:** If there's anything we can do...
     **Martin:** No, I'll be all right, I... I guess I always knew it 
             wouldn't last.
     **Edward:** Marty, the young ones never stay.
      **Emily:** I know what will cheer you up, that "Rigoletto" recording.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, splendid.
     **Edward:** You know, Emily, I'd love to hear it but that shipment is 
             arriving bright and early. [_stands_]
      **Emily:**[_disheartened_] Oh, right.  Frasier, I wish I could stay, but 
             I'm Edward's ride. 
    _Frasier is disappointed, while Martin looks angry with himself._
    **Frasier:** Yes, what a shame.  Well, I guess this is good night, then-
     **Martin:**[_stands_] No, no, wait a minute.  Emily, em, why don't you 
             just stay here with Frasier and enjoy the music. [_gets his 
             coat_] I'll give Edward a ride home.
    **Frasier:** You would do that, Dad?
     **Martin:** Happy Valentine's Day, son.
    **Frasier:**[_overjoyed_] Thanks, Dad.
     **Martin:** All right, good night.
    _They all give their farewells as Martin and Edward exit.  Frasier 
    switches on the opera recording and sits on the couch with Emily._
      **Emily:** It was so sweet of your father to do that.  He really loves 
             you, doesn't he?
    **Frasier:** You have no idea.

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    **OUT WITH DAD
    
    ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Living Room - Evening**
    (Martin, Roz, Daphne, Frasier, Niles)
    
    Martin comes in from his walk with Eddie as Roz and Daphne are 
    settling down to a Valentine's Day evening of old movies and wine. 
    Daphne complains that she will once again be dateless on Valentine's 
    Day, with Donny out of town at his grandmother's funeral. They invite 
    Frasier to join them, but he is anxiously awaiting his date -- Niles 
    -- so that they can leave for the opera, since Mel is attending a 
    medical conference. The doorbell rings and Niles enters, in the 
    middle of gushing to Mel on his cell phone that he will see her in 20 
    minutes. As he hangs up he explains to an indignant Frasier that Mel 
    has changed her plans, and he suggests that Frasier give up his opera 
    ticket so that Niles will have a suitable Valentine's Day present for 
    her. Frasier refuses, and Niles storms out in a huff.
    
    Frasier is left to muse sadly on another evening sitting alone in his 
    opera box, gazing from afar at a lovely woman he's been flirting with 
    in the box across the theater. Roz suggests that instead of staring 
    at the woman Frasier should make a move, and Frasier impulsively 
    decides that Roz is right. He asks Martin to come along so that the 
    woman won't think he is a loser who couldn't get a date. Faced with 
    the choice of opera with Frasier or sad chick flicks with Roz and 
    Daphne, Martin reluctantly agrees.
    
    
    **Scene Title: Out With Dad
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Box At The Opera - That Evening**
    (Frasier, Martin, 
    
    Martin and Frasier scan the theater with opera glasses as Frasier 
    looks for his lady love, who hasn't yet arrived. Martin complains 
    about the senseless plots of operas, having sat through a number of 
    them when he and Hester were dating. Frasier protests that operas are 
    wonderful and starts to explain the convoluted plot of the opera 
    they're about to see. Martin is unimpressed and stands by his 
    objection that no one really acts that way, pretending to be people 
    they're not.
    
    WIth a gasp Frasier spots the woman of his dreams in the opposite 
    box. His attempt to show only polite interest is frustrated by 
    Martin's happy wave to Frasier's dream woman and her companion. But 
    Frasier gets the last laugh when the woman's mother thinks Martin is 
    waving at her. Amused, Fraiser insists that Martin wave back.
    
    **Scene Three - Theater Lobby - Intermission**
    (Frasier, Martin, Emily Browning, Helen Browning)
    
    Frasier looks for the two women and finally spots them across the 
    lobby, waving cheerily. Emily and her mother, Helen, make their way 
    toward Frasier and Martin and introduce themselves. Frasier and Emily 
    depart to fetch some champagne and Martin is left to chat with Helen. 
    Martin fakes his way through a few moments of opera chat until Helen 
    offers him a spare ticket to "Rigoletto" the following week. Martin 
    gropes for an excuse and Helen jumps to a conclusion that seems 
    obvious -- Martin is gay. Martin doesn't contradict her and Frasier 
    and Emily return with both champagne and the news that Emily will be 
    joining Frasier later for a nightcap at his apartment. Emily and her 
    mother depart, Helen filling Emily in on Martin's status as an "opera 
    queen." 
    
    Suddenly Ellen and Helen have a brainstorm -- to introduce Martin to 
    a man they know who would be just perfect for him. Emily remarks 
    excitedly that he is at the performance that evening, and that she 
    will ask him to join her at Frasier's to meet Martin. 
    
    
    ACT TWO
    
    **Scene One - Frasier's Apartment - Later That Evening**
    (Roz, Daphne, Frasier, Martin, Emily, Edward, Niles)
    
    Roz and Daphne are in tears on the sofa as one of their sad movies 
    plays on the VCR. Frasier comes in and grabs the remote control to 
    turn off the movie, then hustles Roz out the door and Daphne off to 
    her room so that he can have his date with Emily. Martin comes in 
    from the kitchen with a cold Ballantyne's to unwind from his 
    stressful evening at the opera, but Frasier demands that he clear the 
    room as well. Before Martin can comply, the doorbell rings and 
    Frasier opens the door to find Emily with Edward, her uncle and 
    partner in the art gallery they own together. 
    
    Edward goes over to the balcony window to admire the view as Emily 
    asks Frasier whether his father is dating anyone. Frasier tells her 
    that he isn't but that he doesn't think Martin is Helen's type. Emily 
    laughingly agrees that Martin has already told Helen about being gay, 
    so she has brought Edward to meet Martin. Just then Martin himself 
    comes in from the kitchen, and introductions are made. Martin is 
    happy to meet another guy his own age, and he and Edward hit it off 
    immediately -- Edward interpreting Martin's friendliness as romantic 
    interest. Frasier drags Martin into the kitchen for a conference.
    
    THE KITCHEN
    
    Frasier tries to tell Martin what is happening, but Martin thinks 
    Frasier is concerned about upholding the lie to Emily's mother. He 
    reassures Frasier that he will "gay it up a little," and he heads 
    back to the living room as Frasier sighs and follows him.
    
    THE LIVING ROOM
    
    Martin compliments Emily on her hairstyle and takes credit for 
    Frasier's decorating taste and aesthetic education. Edward wants to 
    know what Martin used to do for a living and is thrilled to learn 
    that Martin used to be a cop. "The uniform and everything?" he 
    smirks. Martin tells his story about being shot, only in this version 
    he decides to come out of the closet as he's lying in an alley in 
    pool of his own blood. Edward is smitten, and Emily remarks smugly 
    that she and Frasier had known the two men would be perfect for each 
    other. At this Martin finally gets the point and pulls Frasier into 
    the kitchen for another discussion.
    
    THE KITCHEN
    
    Frasier tells Martin that he has to be nice to Edward in order not to 
    spoil Frasier's chances with Emily. Martin panics, "But what if he 
    asks me for a date?" Frasier replies cooly, "I have news for you. 
    You're ON a date."
    
    THE LIVING ROOM
    
    They return to the living room to find Dahpne regaling Edward and 
    Emily with stories of Martin's lonely nights in front of the telly. 
    All he seems to want to do, she says, is watch a bunch of sweaty men 
    running around on a playing field... At that Frasier hauls Daphne to 
    the kitchen for yet another discussion. Martin makes conversation 
    with Edward and Emily as Daphne's loud laughter echoes from the 
    kitchen.
    
    Frasier comes back to the living room with a plate of camembert and a 
    barely suppressed grin. Emily asks him suggestively to show her the 
    rest of the apartment, and he's only too happy to oblige. Daphne 
    comes in to say goodnight, and Martin frantically tries to get her to 
    sit with him and Edward. "No, three's a crowd," Daphne giggles, 
    exiting to her room.
    
    Edward pats the couch next to him, and Martin awkwardly sits down as 
    far from Edward as possible. Edward compliments him on having raised 
    such a fine son. His own son George is 35, and they try to find 
    things in common, but it's difficult. On that, at least, Martin and 
    Edward do agree; it's tough being a father. Edward is encouraged by 
    their cameraderie and asks Martin whether he would be free for dinner 
    some time. Martin gropes for an answer, and Edward backs off quickly. 
    But Martin doesn't want to offend him, and finally tells him that 
    he's dating someone. Edward sees through the thin excuse and assures 
    Martin that he needn't make any excuses, but Martin stands by his 
    story. 
    
    Just then the doorbell rings, and Niles lets himself in. "Darling!" 
    Martin exclaims with relief. Niles is taken aback, but then seems to 
    dismiss it as just another of his father's eccentricities. He 
    proffers the bottle of wine he's brought as a peace offering for the 
    argument earlier, and Martin introduces Edward to Niles -- his 
    boyfriend. Niles covers his astonishment and tries to play along as 
    Martin shepherds him into the kitchen for yet another private 
    discussion.
    
    Frasier returns from the bedroom with Emily rhapsodizing about a 
    wonderful opera sung by the great Matilde de Cagny. He inquires after 
    Martin, and Edward informs him glumly that Martin is in the kitchen 
    with his boyfriend. Martin and Niles come back from the kitchen 
    holding hands, Niles trying to play along even though he's extremely 
    stiff and uncomfortable. 
    
    Edward rises to leave and Emily agrees reluctantly, but Frasier 
    insists that they stay for just a glass of port. He pulls Niles into 
    the kitchen after him.
    
    THE KITCHEN
    
    Frasier declares that it is up to Niles to fix this situation. "How?" 
    Niles ask in exasperation. Frasier replies that it's obvious -- Niles 
    must dump Dad.
    
    THE LIVING ROOM
    
    Fraiser hands out the glasses of port as Niles enters from the 
    kitchen, his face a study as he frantically tries to figure out what 
    to do. Frasier tells him that he missed great opera that evening. 
    Niles senses an opening and replies that he will try to catch it that 
    weekend with Mel. 
    
    "Who's Mel?" Martin asks innocently. "Damn you and your questions!" 
    Niles shouts triumphantly. Frasier nods discrete approval of Niles's 
    brilliant improvisation, and Niles sweeps over to the door in grand 
    style. He pauses only to deliver a withering exit speech, concluding 
    triumphantly, "And I'm keeping the jewelry!" 
    
    Emily and Frasier try to console Martin over his "breakup," and 
    Martin declares that he had known it couldn't last. Frasier puts on 
    some mustic, but Edward begs off and says that he must be going. 
    Emily is reluctant to leave but she must -- she is Edward's ride. 
    Martin can't stand the thought of Frasier spending Valentine's 
    evening with a broken heart, so he smiles and offers to drive Edward 
    home. As the two men leave, Emily is touched and tells Frasier that 
    his father must really love him to do such a nice thing.
    
    "You have no idea," Frasier smiles.
    
    
    **CREDIT TAG**
    
    Daphne is removing a gift card from a large floral arrangement on the 
    dining room table. Martin compliments her on the flowers, which he 
    assumes are from Donny, but Daphne smiles and hands Martin the card. 
    Martin reads it and looks uncomfortable; the flowers are from Edward. 
    Daphne goes off to the kitchen with a big smile as Martin frowns at 
    the bouquet. Finally he softens and leans over to sniff the flowers, 
    then reaches out and plucks one stray flower from the bouquet and 
    replaces it in a better location. He smiles with satisfaction and 
    goes off to watch television.
