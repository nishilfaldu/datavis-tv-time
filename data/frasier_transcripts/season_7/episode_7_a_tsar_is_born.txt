## Review {Mike Lee}

    
    
    As a general rule, my least favorite episodes are the ones that trade 
    on Frasier and Niles's snobbery for the humor.  This one is the 
    exception because it manages to do so in such an original way, both in 
    the raising of their conceit, and in their delicious comeuppance at the 
    end.  It also features a nice insight into the brothers' relationship 
    with Martin, as well as one of the smoothest-running plots I've seen 
    and a couple of memorable interludes, especially the hilarious one with 
    Daphne's wedding dress.  **A**

    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier enters the cafe to find Roz at one of the front tables 
    surfing the net on a laptop.  Frasier sits with her.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Oh, what are you up to?
        **Roz:** Oh, they put in phone jacks so you can go on-line.  I was just 
             talking to this guy who sounds really great. [_Frasier sighs as 
             if the idea is absurd_] What?  I'm a very busy person, how else 
             am I going to meet people?
    **Frasier:** It just seems so impersonal, Roz.  God, what ever happened to 
             human contact?  Engaging people, face to face, eye to eye.
        **Roz:**[_points out Martin at counter_] There's your dad.
    **Frasier:** Don't let him see me! [_turns away as Martin crosses to the 
             table_]
        **Roz:** Hey, Marty.
     **Martin:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey.
     **Martin:** What you been up to?
        **Roz:** Oh, just surfing the net.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Dad.
     **Martin:**[_ignoring his son_] You know, I never got into that net stuff.
        **Roz:** Really?  You really ought to give it a try.  It's a great way 
             to stay in touch with your friends and your family.
     **Martin:** Family?  Gosh, you know, that's nice to know that some people 
             still care about their family.
    **Frasier:** Dad, please!
     **Martin:** Well, I gotta go.  I'm going night-fishing with Duke - and 
             Eddie, of course!  I wouldn't leave Eddie, you don't turn 
             your back on your family!
    _Martin exits the caf e.
    _
        **Roz:** What is that all about?
    **Frasier:** Oh, our Cousin Dodie's wedding was last week.  Oh, excuse me, 
             Cousin Dodie's "weddin'!"  A western theme.  On the response 
             card it asked for our chili preference: mild or "kick ass!"  
             Anyway, Niles and I told her that we had a conference to 
             attend at the Therapist's Guild.
        **Roz:** There is no Therapist's Guild, is there?
    **Frasier:** No.  Dad found us out.
        **Roz:** Wait!  Didn't you have a Therapist Guild conference on Alice's 
             last birthday?
    **Frasier:**[_changing the subject_] The point is, it struck a nerve with 
             Dad! [_then_] I'm sorry, Roz, it's just that he thinks we're 
             ashamed of his family, it's been an issue with him for years, 
             and now he hasn't spoken to me for days.  Thank God, I don't 
             have to deal with this tonight.  I've already ear-marked a 
             fine bottle of Chateau Beychevelle.
        **Roz:** Oh, hot date?
    **Frasier:** No, Niles is coming over to watch "The Antiques Roadshow" 
             with me.
        **Roz:**[_mocking_] I guess you'll be coming in late, tomorrow!
    **Frasier:** It's our favorite show, Roz.
        **Roz:** Party!
    **Frasier:** All right, that's enough.
        **Roz:** Whoo!
    _Roz carries on mocking Frasier as the picture FADES TO BLACK.
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    The lift doors open outside Frasier's apartment.  Niles and Frasier 
    step off of and cross to the door.  They are carry wine and nibbles._
    **Frasier:** I think the roadshow is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 
             tonight.  Amish country!
      **Niles:** Ooh, quilts!
    _They enter the apartment._
    **Frasier:** I'll cork the wine, Niles, you set up the cheese cakes.
    _However they are startled when Martin enters from the kitchen with 
    some nachos and a can of beer._
    **Frasier/Niles:** Dad!
    **Frasier:** I thought you were going night fishing with Duke? 
    _Martin doesn't reply as he nestles in his chair with the remote._
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sakes, you can't keep this up forever, Dad. 
             [_no response_] Well, all right, fine.  I hope you don't mind, 
             but Niles and I are planning on watching a television show.
     **Martin:** Oh, really?  Well, I'm surprised you don't have a conference 
             to go to!
    **Frasier:** Dad, we said we were sorry about Dodie's wedding.
      **Niles:** Yes, and we did send her a baby gift.
     **Martin:** Well, Duke cancelled out on me.  You can have the TV in an 
             hour.  I just want to watch my game show.
    **Frasier:** Oh please, not a game show?
     **Martin:** Hey, I happen to like it, all right?  People bring in all 
             their junk from the attics and these experts tell them what 
             it's worth.
    _The brothers realize that this summary is very similar to the show 
    they are about to watch._
    **Frasier:** Are you talking about "The Antiques Roadshow?"
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's the program Niles and I are going to watch!
    _Martin gives a look of disbelief, so do the brothers._
      **Niles:** I'll just check outside and see if the world has ended.
    _Niles enters the kitchen to set up the cheese cakes as Frasier heads 
    to the couch opening the wine._
     **Martin:** Well, if you want to watch it, no one's stopping you.
    **Frasier:** Well, wonderful. [_laughs_]
    _Martin turns on "The Antiques Roadshow."_
    **Presenter:**[_v.o._] And you have no idea what this writing desk might 
               be worth?
        **Woman:**[_v.o._] No, my husband bought it at a garage sale.
      **Frasier:** That's a lovely piece.  I'd say it's Sheridan. 
    **Presenter:** At auction, this would bring in more than eight thousand 
               dollars.
       **Martin:** Whoa-ho-ho!  Ca-ching!
    _Niles enters with the cheese._
        **Woman:** What about this chair?  Is it an original too?
        **Niles:** It certainly looks it.
       **Martin:** Ah, no, they always do this.  Set 'em up on the first one 
               and then lower the boom on the second one.
        **Niles:** I think that carving looks authentic.
      **Frasier:** So does the inlay.
       **Martin:** No, no, no!
    **Presenter:** I'm sorry to say this chair is a reproduction, worth at 
               best one hundred and fifty dollars.
        **Woman:** Oh, what a shame.
    _Martin smiles at the disbelieving boys._
     **Martin:** Keep watching, boys.  You'll get the hang of it.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment -- Later.
    The three Crane men are getting very friendly at last.  Niles is sat 
    on the floor with a wine glass in his hand.  Frasier's sat on the 
    coffee table with a wine glass.  Martin is in his chair with a can 
    of beer.  "The Antiques Roadshow" is still running.
    _
    **Presenter:**[_v.o._] But the real clue here is the veneer. 
    _The Crane men, playing their drinking game, all shout out "veneer!" and 
    take a swig of their drinks._
    **Presenter:** And now for some background information on the beautiful 
               city of Harrisburg.
       **Martin:** Mute! 
    _Frasier and Niles laugh as Martin turns the sound off.   Daphne enters 
    with a green box._
     **Daphne:** Evening, all. [_they greet her_] Wow!  I don't see the three 
             of you watching the same show very often.  What's going on? 
             Pavarotti jumping the Grand Canyon? 
     **Martin:** It's "The Antiques Roadshow."  What you got in the box?
     **Daphne:** Oh, it's Donny's mother's wedding gown.  He wants me to wear 
             it at the wedding.  What if I don't like it?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, if you want to try it on, we'll be glad to have a 
             look.
     **Martin:** Just go put it on.
    _Daphne exits with the box to her room._
        **Frasier:** Dad, Dad, turn it up. [_he does_]
    **Sara Briggs:** But the real masterwork is the unique art deco headboard.  
                 It features a variety of veneers.
    _They all shout out "veneer!" and sip._
    **Sara Briggs:** Mahogany veneer...
    _Once again._
    **Sara Briggs:** Burled walnut veneer...
    _Yet again they swallow another swig._
    **Sara Briggs:** And zebra wood veneer.
    _For the final time they take one last drink._
    **Sara Briggs:** And now back to our...
        **Frasier:**[_recovering_] Oh God... next week we gotta pick a different 
                 word.  Need another bottle of wine, Niles.
         **Martin:** Yeah, me too, I love these educational shows.
    _Frasier enters the kitchen with the old bottle of wine as Niles also 
    brings in Martin's old beer cans.  Frasier gets a new bottle as Niles 
    gets another beer from the fridge for his father._
    **Frasier:** You know, I can't get over Dad.  It seems this little rift 
             between us has been mended.
      **Niles:** Can you believe he used the word "craftsman," and he meant the 
             architectural style, and not the rotary sander?
    **Frasier:** You know, that's uncanny.
      **Niles:** Well, you heard him.
    **Frasier:** No, not that, you just said "rotary sander."
    _They go back into the living room._
    **Frasier:** Dad, did we miss anything?
     **Martin:** Nah, just some bozo with a credenza who doesn't know a 
             Biedermeier from an Oscar Meyer.
    _They all laugh.  The theme music for the show's end plays._
    **Presenter:** That's it for this week.  See you next time on "The Antiques 
               Roadshow."  Next Saturday the roadshow will be here in 
               Seattle.  
       **Martin:** Oh!
    **Presenter:** Viewers can bring their treasures to the convention center 
               for a free appraisal.
       **Martin:** We oughta go, that'd be great.
      **Frasier:** Well sure, Dad.
        **Niles:** That does sound like fun.
       **Martin:** Yeah, I'm going to go and have a little root around in 
               our closet.  I bet I can find a nice little [_correct 
               pronunciation_] _objet d'art_ they'd be interested in.
    _Martin exits to his room, leaving his sons gobsmacked again._
      **Niles:** It's as if that panhandler I gave money to was a genie 
             granting all my wishes.
     **Daphne:** Would you marry me in this?
    _We see that Daphne has entered.  She is wearing the "wedding gown."  
    It consists of white go-go boots, a fluffy white veil and very little 
    else.  In fact, just a white miniskirt connected to a tight white bra 
    by flimsy suspenders.  Niles nearly faints._
    **Frasier:**[_whispers_] How much did you give him?
      **Niles:** It's attractive, Daphne.  It's a bit unorthodox.
     **Daphne:** Yeah.  That's what I think.
    _Daphne picks up the phone and calls Donny._
     **Daphne:** Donny, I've just put your mum's wedding dress on.  A mini-
             skirt?  It's obscene!  You can see my... What?  No, I took 
             the green box. [_laughs_] No problem, then.  Bye. [_hangs up_] 
             I took the wrong dress.  This is from his mother's third 
             marriage in 1968 in Las Vegas.
    _Daphne starts laughing along with Niles.  Daphne bends down trying to 
    control her laughter.  Niles peers over her and down her bra without 
    her noticing._
     **Daphne:** Can you believe people used to actually dress like this?
      **Niles:** I wish I had a picture of it for whenever I needed a laugh. 
             [_tries to follow her to her bedroom_]
    **Frasier:** Niles!
    _Niles walks back sighing in fantasy.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **A TSAR IS BORN**
    _Scene Four - The Antiques Roadshow.
    Martin and Frasier are hanging around the set.  Martin is holding a 
    rather ugly pewter clock consisting of a small round dial set in the 
    middle of a hideous bear._
     **Martin:** This bear clock's been in the family for generations, I can't 
             wait to see how much it's worth.  Do you think they'll put a 
             dollar figure on it?
    **Frasier:** Sounds about right.
     **Martin:** Very funny, but you know, your grandpa passed this down to me 
             and someday, when I'm gone, it'll be passed on to you.
    **Frasier:** Dad, please, I don't even want to think about that day.
     **Martin:** You know, I've got to see if I can go and get this baby 
             appraised.
    _Martin goes off to the appraisers as Niles enters._
      **Niles:** I am so sorry, but on the way in I had the most amazing 
             celebrity sighting: Hans Dietrich.
    **Frasier:**[_thrilled_] The loveseat expert?
      **Niles:** The very same.  He's much smaller in person than on television.
             He's that big. [_holds a hand up to the bottom of his neck_]
    **Frasier:** Get out!
     **Martin:** Boys, come over here, they want to put me and the clock on TV.
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, we can't appear on TV with that hideous thing.
      **Niles:** Everyone we know watches this program.
    **Frasier:** Thank God he didn't bring along that dreadful mounted 
             jackrabbit's head with the antelope horns.
      **Niles:** The Jackalope!  Texas's answer to the Minotaur.
     **Martin:** So what do you think of that, boys?  They said they've never 
             seen anything like it.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know, this could go either way.
     **Martin:** Oh, I know.  I'm not going to act like one of those saps I 
             make fun of.  Doesn't matter if it's worth two dollars or 
             two thousand, I'm just gonna say, "That's pretty much what 
             I figured."
    _The director shouts that tape is rolling so Niles and Frasier back 
    off out of view from the camera.  The bear clock is on a table in 
    front of the camera.  Martin and the appraiser are standing around 
    the table._
       **Martin:**[_calls to boys_] Guys, which one of you wants to come and 
               hold this?
      **Frasier:** No, no, Dad.  We wouldn't dream of it.
        **Niles:** This is your moment.
     **Director:** Everybody ready?  Action.
    **Appraiser:** So, Martin, what can you tell us about this pewter clock?
       **Martin:**[_playing to the camera_] Well, it is a clock set in the 
               stomach of what appears to be a bear.
    **Appraiser:** Actually, it's much more than that.  It's Russian, made in 
               the mid-nineteenth century.
       **Martin:** That's pretty much what I figured.
    **Appraiser:** Actually, it's a stunning piece.  It was made by Andre 
               Krogyn, who worked for Tsar Alexander II.
       **Martin:** That is pretty much what I figured.
    **Appraiser:** I don't know if you're descended from the Romanovs, Martin, 
               but all of Krogyn's known bear clocks were done exclusively 
               for the Romanov family and are now in the Hermitage Museum.
    _By now, Niles and Frasier, baffled by the findings, have walked into 
    camera view and are standing alongside Martin._
    **Appraiser:** Martin, you may be surprised to learn that this clock at 
               auction would easily bring $25,000. 
       **Martin:**[_excited_] Ca-ching!
    _He laughs and claps his hands excitedly, but Frasier and Niles calm him 
    into acting reserved again._
    **Frasier:** What he means is, that's pretty much what we figured.
    _Frasier reaches out and strokes the bear clock like a favorite 
    possession while he and Niles smile into the camera.
    
    End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin, Niles and Frasier enter the apartment with the bear clock in 
    hand._
    **Frasier:** After you, Dad.
     **Martin:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** So, you know, Dad?  I've been thinking, we should find an 
             appropriate place for this clock.  How about right here on 
             this console? [_puts it on table behind sofa_]
     **Martin:** Oh, I get it!  It doesn't look quite so bad to you guys now 
             that it's worth twenty-five grand.  Oh, I could kick myself 
             for not bringing that Jackalope!
    _Martin exits to the kitchen as Niles and Frasier give a look at each 
    other._
      **Niles:** What an amazing day, eh?
    **Frasier:** It certainly was.  You know, Niles, I was meaning to ask you 
             about something.  Remember the appraiser said something about 
             the bear being from Russia, dad being part of the Romanov 
             family?
      **Niles:** Yeah, yeah, you know, that struck my ear too.
    **Frasier:** Yes, although I don't seriously believe there's any real 
             chance of that.
      **Niles:**[_half-heartedly_] No, of course not.
    **Frasier:**[_dragging it out_] It's a long shot.
      **Niles:** It's possible.
    **Frasier:** Although we do have the bear.
      **Niles:** I know.
    _Martin enters back from the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad.  Niles just reminded me of something I completely 
             forgot.  When the appraiser mentioned that the bear was from 
             Russia...
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah.  Well, it probably got passed down through your 
             great-great grandmother.  She was from Russia.
    **Frasier:** A-ha, he said something about the Romanov family?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, that, eh?  Are you sure you want to hear about 
             this? 
      **Niles:**[_no question_] Yes, Dad.
     **Martin:** Well, I guess you would have found out anyway after I died... 
             We're royalty. 
    _Frasier and Niles are ecstatic._
     **Martin:** But I didn't want you to grow up spoiled, so I abdicated 
             and took a job in Seattle on the police force. [_the brothers 
             realize his joke_] It was kinda hard giving up that royal way 
             of life, but I think maybe it's the swans that I miss most.
    **Frasier:** Very funny, Dad.  Point taken.  Sherry, Niles? [_crosses to 
             sherry_]
      **Niles:** Please.
     **Martin:** I'm sorry to disappoint you.  I know you'd rather be anything 
             else in the world except Cranes!
    **Frasier:** Dad!  Now that is just not true, we are proud to be Cranes. 
             It's just innocent curiosity.
     **Martin:** Well, I gotta go call Duke.  But don't get excited, he's not 
             a real Duke.
    _Martin exits to his room as Frasier brings the sherries across to 
    Niles._
      **Niles:** Well, we stepped in it that time.
    **Frasier:** Yes, what the hell is wrong with us?  Asking whether we are 
             related to the Romanovs.  We just got past this whole Crane 
             shame thing.
      **Niles:** We should have known it'd just upset him.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and for what?  Trying to find some distant connection to 
             royalty. 
      **Niles:** Even if we can prove it, what do we have? 
    **Frasier:** Huh, a story to tell at parties.
      **Niles:** An occasional seat at a state dinner.
    **Frasier:** Some meaningless title.  It's insane.
      **Niles:** Ridiculous... destructive.
    **Frasier:** Still, there is this grandmother.
      **Niles:** I'm right behind you.
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, given our new pride in the Crane name, 
             perhaps it would behoove us to research our family tree. 
      **Niles:** Actually, in a way we'd be honoring Dad.
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course we wouldn't need to tell him.
      **Niles:** No.
    **Frasier:** Just a few hours on the internet, a trip to the library, 
             we could sketch in the entire family tree.  
      **Niles:** And if there should happen to be a connection [_breathless with 
             glee_] to the Romanovs...
    **Frasier:** Well, what harm is there in that?  
    
    [_N.B. Famous last words._]
    
    **Frasier:** It is amusing to contemplate, isn't it, Niles?  You, me, Dad - 
             all part of an ancient noble family.
    _Martin then bursts out his room holding the jackalope to his forehead
    and chasing Eddie into the kitchen, showing off the true noble spirit 
    of the Crane family._
     **Martin:** Okay Eddie, the jackalope's gonna get ya!  The jackalope is  
             gonna get ya!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier is surfing the internet and tracing his family tree at the 
    window seat as Roz enters wearing a red dress with a silk shawl.
    _
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.  How's the research going?
    **Frasier:** Oh, sit down, Roz.  I'll bring you up to speed. 
        **Roz:** No, thank you. [_sits on another table_] I'm meeting someone.
    **Frasier:** Good God!  Not one of your internet dalliances?
        **Roz:** It's just coffee, okay?  Listen, this guy's totally legit, he 
             e-mailed me his picture. [_holds it up_]
    **Frasier:** A picture?  Oh, for God's sakes, Roz, what can you learn 
             from a picture?  The man's probably a lunatic, a psychopath... 
             [_looks at picture_] Oh, he's a pretty boy.
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Wait... I know this photo.  It's the cover of this month's 
             Bidwell's catalogue!
        **Roz:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** I'm positive, I ordered those socks and driving shoes!
        **Roz:** How could someone do this?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's probably some insecure would-be Romeo trying to 
             lure you into a meeting.
    _And then, as if in response to his description, in pops Noel._
       **Noel:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Noel.
       **Noel:**[_to Roz_] What have we here?  An empty seat next to yours.  
             May I?
        **Roz:** No!  Of all the dumbass things you've done to get me to go out 
             with you, e-mailing me this picture is just the most moronic!
       **Noel:** But, Roz-!
        **Roz:** Forget it, buddy!
    _The man in Roz's photo enters Nervosa and watches the scene, as Roz 
    backs Noel into the counter, hitting him with the picture._
        **Roz:** I ought to take your mouse cord and wrap it around your nerdy 
             little neck until your eyes pop out like champagne corks!
       **Noel:**[_looks at picture_] But I didn't send you this.
        **Roz:** Yeah right, then who did?
       **Noel:** My guess would be... [_points to man_] that guy.
    _Roz turns and gasps.  The man leaves, disappointed with her._
        **Roz:** Oh my God!  Oh, Noel, I'm so sorry. [_gathers her things_]
       **Noel:** How sorry?
        **Roz:** Not that sorry.
    _Roz exits chasing after her date as Niles enters._
      **Niles:** I just saw the Bidwell's guy!
    **Frasier:** Yes. [_Niles sits_] Well Niles, how goes the research?
      **Niles:** Oh, I think you're going to be very pleased.  According to 
             this catalogue of Russian antiquities, the bear clock was 
             last seen in Moscow in 1879.
    **Frasier:** Well, hold on to your fur hat, Niles.  I just discovered that 
             our great-great grandmother emigrated from Russia... 1879!
      **Niles:** My God, it's all coming together.  I can practically picture 
             the scene.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** Our great-great grandmother, smelling revolution in the 
             wind...
    **Frasier:** Secretly slips away in the black Russian night...
      **Niles:** Taking the bear clock with her to remind her of better 
             days.
    **Frasier:** Yes!  The ticking hands of time counting down her return, her 
             royal power merely hibernating. [_Frasier's mobile sounds, he 
             answers_] Yes?  Yes, yes, I'll hold.
      **Niles:** Who is it?
    **Frasier:** It's Dr. Myshkin.  He's an attache at the Russian embassy,
             also an expert on the Romanovs. [_to phone_] Yes, Dr. Myshkin.  
             This evening would be fine.  About seven � clock.  Yes, I live 
             in the Elliot Bay Towers.  I'll see you then. [_hangs up_] He 
             has some important information for us.  My God, Niles, this is 
             it.  The final link to our royal past.  I'm going to issue a 
             press release!
      **Niles:** Not before I shout it from the rooftops! [_notices Martin 
             entering_] Here's Dad, hide everything!
    _They quickly clean things off the table and shut the laptop as Martin 
    enters._
     **Martin:** Hey guys, I thought I'd find you here.  You know, you just 
             missed seeing yourselves on "The Antiques Roadshow." [_They 
             fake noises of disappointment_] And you know, the phone's been 
             ringing off the hook, everybody wants to buy that bear clock.
    **Frasier:** You're not thinking of selling it, are you?
     **Martin:** You're damn right I am!  Some guy just offered me twenty-six 
             thousand for it.  I'm gonna buy me a big, honking fishing 
             boat, with a Wave Pounder 450 and a fun deck.  Good for 
             fishin', crusin', or just plain tubin'! [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** Did you hear that Frasier?  We can go tubin'. [_Mouths to 
             Frasier "Do Something!"_]
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, perhaps Niles and I could sell the clock for 
             you.  I mean, we do know the antiques world and you know, 
             we could get you more than twenty-six thousand.
     **Martin:** Oh!
      **Niles:** I should think at least thirty thousand.
     **Martin:** Huh.  You know, maybe I will let you boys handle this.
    **Frasier:** Wise move, Dad. 
      **Niles:** Yeah, we'd hate to see you get manipulated.
    _Martin leaves the cafe as Frasier and Niles exchange congratulatory 
    grins.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **MYSHKIN ACCOMPLISHED**
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    The doorbell sounds.  Niles and Frasier answer it to Dr. Myshkin._
    **Myshkin:** Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Dr. Myshkin, please.  Come in.  This is my brother, Dr. Niles 
             Crane.
    _Niles clicks his heels and bobs his head in his version of a communist 
    salute._
    **Myshkin:**[_spots clock_] Oh, there it is. 
    **Frasier:** Please, have a look. [_he does_] Is it authentic?
    **Myshkin:** Without a doubt. [_Frasier gasps_]
      **Niles:** Frasier... 
    **Frasier:** I know.
    _Then Daphne enters from her room with the laundry._
    **Frasier:** Daphne, you know, there is some caviar on the ice in the 
             kitchen.  Now would be the appropriate time, if you would, 
             please?
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastic_] Oh, I am so sorry.  Here I am, dawdling with 
             the laundry when it's ten minutes into caviar time!
    _Daphne exits to kitchen._
    **Myshkin:** As I mentioned, I have some information which should be very 
             interesting to you.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, please make yourself comfortable. Do tell, tell.
    **Myshkin:**[_holds up a book_] This is a copy of the diary of Princess 
             Sonia Romanov, daughter to Tsar Alexander II.  At eighteen 
             she fell in love with a commoner, an American. [_Niles mouths 
             "Our grandmother" to Frasier_] Their union, of course, was 
             forbidden, but Sonia decided to give everything up for love.
    **Frasier:**_Quel elegance._
    **Myshkin:** She enlisted the aid of a scullery maid, who smuggled money, 
             clothing and this bear clock out of the palace. 
      **Niles:**[_thrilled_] She would elope to America!
    **Myshkin:** Yes, that was her plan, but when Sonia found her way to the 
             train station under the cover of night, the scullery maid 
             absconded with everything, including the clock. 
      **Niles:** Servants!
    **Frasier:** There's a back aching for the lash!
    _The camera then cuts to Daphne who has already entered the room with 
    the caviar.  She gets the wrong end of the stick._
     **Daphne:** I'm moving as fast as I can! [_slams caviar down and exits_]
    **Frasier:** Now, tell us.  How did we get our clock back?
      **Niles:** Yes, tell us, how did Great-Great-Grandmamma retrieve it?
    **Myshkin:**[_confused for a moment, then_] Uh, Drs. Crane... your ancestor 
             is not the princess, your ancestor is the scullery maid.  
    _Silence as Frasier and Niles absorb this bombshell.  Then Myshkin 
    stands and picks up the clock._
    **Myshkin:** Well, on behalf of the Russian people, I thank you for 
             retrieving this for us. 
    **Frasier:** You mean, you're just going to take it?!
    **Myshkin:** Well, its rightful place is in the Hermitage Museum. 
      **Niles:** But this clock has been in our family for generations...
    **Frasier:** Niles. [_Frasier motions him to cover the front door, he does_]
    **Myshkin:** Dr. Crane, we could settle this in the courts, but you 
             wouldn't win.  Do you really want this to come out in 
             the press?
    **Frasier:** Well, do you really expect us just to let you walk out of here 
             with a precious family heirloom?!
    **Myshkin:** Did I mention that your ancestor, before she married a Noah 
             Crane in 1882, worked as a prostitute in New York?
    _Beat._
    **Frasier:** Enjoy your bear.
    _Niles steps aside letting Myshkin out.  As the door is opened we find 
    Martin just entering._
     **Martin:** Oh, hello.
    **Myshkin:** Dr. Profiry Myshkin.
     **Martin:**[_shaking hands_] Marty Crane.  I see you've got the clock.
    **Myshkin:** That's right.  Good evening, all.
     **Martin:** Bye.
    _Myshkin and the clock disappear forever._
    
     **Martin:** You sold it!  I hope you got a good price.
    **Frasier:** Gee, Dad, I hope you didn't buy a boat.
     **Martin:** No, I was thinking about it and then I thought, oh hell.  
             We've been getting along so well... [_to Frasier_] And you 
             don't like fishing. [_to Niles_] And you get seasick.  Why 
             not get something we can all enjoy, you know? 
    _For a moment they look hopeful._
     **Martin:** So I bought this! [_holds up a picture of an RV to the boys_]
      **Niles:**[_covering with mock excitement_] A Winnebago!
     **Martin:** Yeah!
    **Frasier:** A big one!
     **Martin:** Thirty-three footer, with air suspension and power jacks. 
             Thirty thousand used, but you got that much for the clock, 
             right?
    **Frasier:** Of course. [_Niles looks at him sharply_]
     **Martin:** Oh, that's great.  We can go anywhere.  You know, the first 
             place I want to go is Elmo, Nebraska.  We got a whole mess 
             of cousins down there! [_exits to kitchen_]
    _The boys slump down on the couch and pick up some drinks._
    **Frasier:** Well... we're out fifteen thousand each.
      **Niles:** And we have to take long trips in a Winnebago.
    **Frasier:** And we're not Romanovs.  We're descended from thieves and 
             whores.
    _Pause._
      **Niles:** You know, I remember reading that Henry James once had a 
             liaison with a Russian prostitute in New York.
    **Frasier:** I'm right behind you. 
    _They clink glasses once again.
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles is sipping sherry on Frasier's sofa as Daphne enters the living
    room dressed once again in the revealing bridal outfit.  She climbs up 
    on the coffee table and begins an enthusiastic rendition of the frug, 
    the swim, and other 60's dances.  Niles beams and sips his sherry.
    
    Suddenly Niles wakes up from a nap on the sofa, and looks around 
    eagerly to find Daphne, who isn't there.  He drains the dregs of his 
    sherry from a glass on the coffee table, and settles back down to try
    recapturing his enticing dream.

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    **ACT ONE  
    
      
    
    SCENE ONE - CAFE NEVOSA - DAY  
    
    (Frasier, Roz, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Roz is seated at a table typing on a laptop computer as Frasier comes
    over to her table.  Since the cafe has installed phone jacks, she's
    been chatting online and is becoming a big fan of meeting people that
    way.  Frasier complains that it seems so impersonal and that people
    should talk face to face, but changes his tune abruptly when he spots his
    father and attempts to hide.  Martin sees them anyway and comes over
    to greet Roz warmly and pointedly ignore Frasier.  Roz tries to sell
    him on the virtues of chatting with family and friends on the computer,
    and Martin agrees that one doesn't turn one's back on family.  He
    bids Roz goodbye, still without acknowledging Frasier, and goes off to
    get ready for an evening of night fishing with Duke.  
    
      
    
    Roz asks Frasier what the problem is with his father.  Frasier
    explains that Martin is still angry at Frasier and Niles for making an
    excuse not to go to their cousin Dodie's recent Western-themed
    wedding.  Martin thinks the boys are ashamed of their family and
    hasn't spoken Frasier for days.  Frasier is looking forward to not
    dealing with Martin that evening; Niles is coming over to watch the
    Antiques Road Show on public television.  
    
      
    
      
    
    SCENE TWO - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING  
    
    (Frasier, Niles, Martin, Daphne)  
    
      
    
    Frasier and Niles arrive at the apartment with cheese and wine, looking
    forward to their evening of television, only to find Martin preparing to
    watch his favorite gameshow -- which turns out to be the Antiques Road
    Show.  All three of them are flabbergasted to realize they like the
    same show, but they settle in and start making guesses about whether the
    antiques show will turn out to be real or not.  Predictably, Martin
    proves better at figuring out the pattern of the show than either of his
    sons.  
    
      
    
    DISSOLVE TO THE APARTMENT - LATER  
    
      
    
    The three Cranes are still watching the show and having a rather good
    time at it, too.  They have begun a friendly drinking game where
    they each down a large swallow from their wineglass or beer can each time
    the word "veneer" is mentioned.  Just then Daphne arrives
    home with a large box under her arm.  It's Donny's mother's wedding
    gown, and Daphne is apprehensive about looking at it for fear she won't
    want to wear it.  Martin suggests that she try it on for them to
    look at, and she exits to her room.  The men return to drinking and
    watching their show, where a discussion of wood surfaces nearly finishes
    them off.  They decide to take a break from drinking and the boys go
    to the kitchen to replenish the supply of beer and wine.   
    
      
    
    Frasier and Niles remark at how engrossed their father has become in the
    antiques show.  It's as if their father has picked up some of their
    polish, and the rift between them has been mended.    
    
      
    
    The boys return to the living room just in time to hear the end of the
    show, and the announcer saying that the show will travel to Seattle the
    following week.  All three Cranes exclaim over the exciting news,
    and Martin rushes off to his room to see whether he can unearth any
    "objets d'art."  Niles remarks that he had given some
    money to a panhandler earlier in the day, and it's as if all his wishes
    are coming true.  
    
      
    
    Another wish is apparently granted as Daphne enters the living room
    wearing white go-go boots, a short bridal veil, and a white satin wedding
    dress that consists of a miniskirt and midriff-baring top held together
    with flimsy suspenders.  Niles's jaw drops.  Daphne can't
    believe that Donny wants her to wear such a thing, and she gets him on
    the phone to tell him so.  It turns out Daphne has grabbed the wrong
    dress, and Niles shares a laugh with her while surreptitiously ogling her
    in the skimpy outfit.  She returns to her room to take the dress
    off, nearly followed by an entranced Niles until Frasier brings him back
    to earth.  
    
      
    
      
    
    SCENE THREE - EXHIBITION HALL - THE FOLLOWING WEEK - DAY  
    
    (Frasier, Niles, Martin, TV host)  
    
      
    
    The hall is filled with hopeful people and their precious heirlooms as
    Martin waits his turn with an ugly antique bear clock.  His father
    passed it on to him, and Martin promises Frasier that someday it will be
    his.  Frasier feigns enthusiasm as Martin heads off to find an
    appraiser for the clock.   Niles arrives just in time to hear
    Martin calling them over to the appraiser's table.  The producers
    want to put Martin on the show.  The boys are reluctant to appear on
    camera with the hideous clock and leave Martin alone to his moment of
    glory.    
    
      
    
    Their interest is piqued as the host informs Martin that the bear clock
    was made by a famous Russian artisan who worked exclusively for the
    Romanovs.  The clock is sure to be worth at least $20,000 at
    auction.  Meanwhile, the boys creep closer and closer to the camera
    as the host mentions the Russian royal family, and they finally end up
    side by side with Martin, looking into the camera with their best
    impersonation of imperial dignity.    
    
      
    
      
    
    ACT TWO  
    
      
    
    SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - AFTER THE ANTIQUES SHOW  
    
    (Frasier, Niles, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Frasier polishes a cozy spot for the precious clock on the console
    directly behind the sofa as Martin goes off to the kitchen for a
    beer.  Frasier and Niles start to discuss the antique show host's
    mention of the Russian royal family, and before long have half-convinced
    themselves that they are Romanovs.   As Martin returns to the
    living room they inquire delicately about the possibility, and Martin
    goes along with them for a few moments before bursting their
    bubble.  They did have a great-great-grandmother from Russia, but
    that is as close as they will ever get to royalty.  Unfortunately,
    the boys will have to be content with being mere Cranes.  Martin
    exits to the bedroom.  
    
      
    
    Frasier and Niles can't believe they've gotten into their father's bad
    graces again by showing a lack of enthusiasm for the family, but their
    guilt is short-lived as they return to speculation about a possible
    connection to the Romanovs.  They resolve to do just a little bit of
    research on the sly to check out their Russian ancestor.    
    
      
    
      
    
    SCENE TWO - CAFE NERVOSA - DAY  
    
    (Frasier, Roz, Noel, Roz's Date, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Frasier is seated near the window doing research on a laptop computer as
    Roz enters in a slinky outfit.  She informs Frasier that she's
    meeting a man at the cafe, and he begins to take her to task for meeting
    one of her "Internet dalliances."  Roz retorts that this
    guy is a catch, and shows Frasier a picture he sent her.  Frasier
    recognizes it immediately as the photo of a male model from the front of
    a recent mail order catalog, and Roz is crushed to think that someone is
    trying to lure her into a meeting.    
    
      
    
    Enter Noel Shempsky, who attempts to seat himself at Roz's table. 
    Roz goes ballistic and begins beating Noel about the head and shoulders
    with the photograph, accusing him of e-mailing her the picture so she
    will go out with him.  Noel protests that he didn't send the photo,
    and points out the model who has just entered the cafe looking for
    Roz.  Roz apologizes hastily to Noel and takes off after the model,
    who has fled after watching her mistreat Noel.  
    
      
    
    Niles comes in to sit with Frasier and to exchange research
    reports.  Apparently the clock was last seen in Russia just shortly
    before their great-great-grandmother emigrated.  The brothers nearly
    hyperventilate over the fantasy of their grandmother's romantic escape
    from Russia.  Frasier answers a call on his cell phone from Dr.
    Myshkin, a Russian expert who has agreed to meet Frasier to provide some
    interesting information about their family.  They arrange for him to
    come to the apartment that evening, and as they hang up, Frasier and
    Niles frantically hide the research materials when Martin enters the
    cafe.  
    
      
    
    Martin tells them that people have been calling with offers to buy the
    famous clock, and he waxes enthuiastic about his plans to sell it and buy
    a large boat.  The boys are alarmed at his plan to sell their only
    hope of nobility, and offer to sell it for him for more than he's been
    offered.  Martin agrees, and heads back home   
    
      
    
      
    
    SCENE THREE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING  
    
    (Frasier, Niles, Dr. Myshkin, Daphne, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Dr. Myshkin arrives from the Russian embassy to examine the clock, which
    he pronounces absolutely genuine.  Frasier asks Daphne to serve the
    caviar in celebration, and they sit down with Myshkin to learn the story
    of their family's connection to Russia.  But the story isn't what
    they'd hoped.  It turns out that their grandmother was a servant who
    absconded with her mistresses's valuables one night, and Myshkin informs
    them that the rightful place for the masterpiece is in the Hermitage
    museum.  Frasier protests, but Myskin adds that they surely wouldn't
    want it generally known that their grandmother had been a prostitute in
    New York before marrying their ancestor, Noah Crane.  Defeated,
    Frasier allows Myskin to leave with the precious clock.  
    
      
    
    Martin arrives home just in time to see Myshkin's departure.  He is
    elated that the boys have sold the clock, and smugly informs them that he
    has decided against buying the boat.  Frasier and Niles's sighs of
    relief are cut short when Martin reveals that he has spent $30,000 to buy
    a Winnebago motor home, so that they can all takes lots of vacations

    Niles is sipping sherry on Frasier's sofa as Daphne enters the living
    room dressed once again in the revealing bridal outfit.  She climbs
    up on the coffee table and begins an enthusiastic rendition of the frug,
    the swim, and other 60's dances.  Niles beams and sips his
    sherry.    
    
      
    
    Suddenly Niles wakes up from a nap on the sofa, and looks around eagerly
    to find Daphne, who isn't there.  He drains the dregs of his sherry
    from a glass on the coffee table, and settles back down to try
    recapturing his enticing dream.
