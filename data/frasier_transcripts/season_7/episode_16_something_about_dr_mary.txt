    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    Roz and Frasier are sat chatting.  There are color charts on the table.
    _
        **Roz:** Why did I ever decide to redecorate my bathroom?  They give 
             you about a thousand decisions to make.  After a while, you 
             can't even tell the colors apart.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, perhaps my discerning decorative eye can be of some 
             assistance, let me see here. 
    _He arranges three white panels in a row on the table._
    **Frasier:** This one's Ecruel, that's Eggshell and this of course is 
             Nolove White.
        **Roz:** Very good, Frasier.  Now let's see how you do on the color 
             side. [_turns them over_]
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz, I do hope you don't spend your entire vacation 
             redecorating.  You know, you should get out, you know, have 
             some fun, maybe even take a cruise?  You don't want to stay in 
             your apartment cooped up with a bunch of sweaty workmen. 
    _Roz gives him a glance and he realizes._
    **Frasier:**_Bon Voyage._
        **Roz:** Thank you, and don't worry, Chuck Ranberg said he'd take 
             over for the week-
    **Frasier:** No, no, absolutely not, Roz!  The man's speech impediment 
             will make me giggle all week long.
        **Roz:** Show a little compassion! 
    **Frasier:** Oh come on, you try dealing with a call screener who says, 
             "Doctaw Cwane, we have a kweptomaniac on wine fwee."
        **Roz:** Well, who do you want to use?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, I was thinking of reaching out to the 
             community.  You know, I was guest speaker last month at a 
             program called "Second Start."  They offer career training 
             for people who are stuck in tedious, low-paying jobs.  And, 
             em, well, I'd thought I'd give the job to one of those 
             students.
        **Roz:** That's a great idea, Frasier.  Sounds like a great program.
    _Chuck Ranberg enters._
    [_N.B. Chuck Ranberg is the name of one of the show's writers._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh dear, there's Chuck Ranberg.  Roz, you've got to tell him 
             he doesn't have the job.
        **Roz:** Why can't you tell him?
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I can't hear the man speak without just descending 
             into giggles.
        **Roz:** Oh, you are such a child!
    **Frasier:**[_mumbles hurrying her_]
    _Chuck approaches them._
      **Chuck:** Hi, guys.
        **Roz:** Hey, Chuck, how's it going?
      **Chuck:** Oh, tewwible, Woz!  My wife was in the Cawwibean and she weft 
             me for a Wastafawian!
    _Roz starts laughing uncontrollably as Frasier pats her arm trying to 
    cover up by pretending she is crying.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Radio Station.
    We see a Seattle tram pass by with an advert promoting Frasier's 
    show. There is a picture of Frasier and a slogan with the words "I'm 
    Listening." 
    
    CUT TO: The Studio. 
    Frasier is talking to the temporary call screener, Mary Thomas, a jolly 
    black woman of around thirty years._
    **Frasier:** We only have a couple of minutes before the show, so listen, 
             tell me a little bit about yourself.  How did you get 
             interested in broadcasting?
       **Mary:** Well, after I got laid off from the bakery, I guess I had 
             some free time.  So I took a few different night school 
             courses and when I got to the one in radio, it all clicked.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, isn't that funny?  You know, I had almost exactly 
             the same experience.  I first discovered psychiatry in Dr. 
             Badgley's epidemiology seminar at Harvard.
       **Mary:** Except I bet you didn't walk though a metal detector to get 
             to class!
    **Frasier:** No, no, but, you know, I did have to pass under a dangerously 
             unbalanced portrait of Alfred Adler in the Rotunda! [_laughs_]
       **Mary:** We are practically separated at birth!
    **Frasier:** Ten seconds, Mary, coming up.
       **Mary:** Oh, I'm so nervous.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you'll be fine, just relax.
       **Mary:** Okay. [_sits in her seat as Frasier sits in his_]
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Hello, Seattle.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane and I'm 
             listening.  I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce 
             someone who's going to bring her own flavor to the show 
             this week while Roz is gone.  Say hello to Mary Thomas. [_Mary 
             nods; encouraging her to talk_] It's great to have you with 
             us, Mary. [_Mary only smiles_] You know, we want to get right 
             to your calls, folks.  So, we'll be right back after this.
    _Frasier cuts to commercials as he goes into Mary's booth._
    **Frasier:** Mary, I should mention that you should feel free to speak on 
             the air.  You know, Roz often chimes in from time to time. 
       **Mary:** Oh, I can't believe I messed up so quickly.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, no, not at all, not at all.  Just promise me that 
             you'll speak up when it feels right.
       **Mary:** I will!
    **Frasier:** Okay, great, I'm sure you have excellent instincts.
       **Mary:** Five seconds.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    _Frasier goes back to his seat._
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] And we're back.  All right, Mary, who's our first 
             caller?
       **Mary:**[_emphasized_] Maria! [_Frasier urges her to carry on_] Er, 
             she's thirty-six years old... married five years... and 
             her husband's been staying late at the office so he can 
             meet with his secretary.
    **Frasier:**[_happy for Mary_] That's the way to do it! [_realizing_] 
             I mean, I'm sorry, Maria, em, I'm Listening.
      **Maria:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane.  Anyway, he's having an affair and it's 
             not his first.  This has been going on since we were 
             newlyweds.  How do I get him to change?
    **Frasier:** Well, Maria.  You of course know it's impossible to force 
             anyone to change.  But you can work to change yourself. 
             Usually women that tolerate this sort of behavior from 
             their husbands are suffering from low self-esteem issues, 
             you may need some counseling to resolve those issues.  Let 
             me ask you a couple of questions...
       **Mary:** May I say something?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
       **Mary:** Maria, Dr. Crane is right.  You must make a change.  And the 
             first thing you change is the lock on your front door. 
    **Frasier:**[_not too pleased_] What?
      **Maria:** Oh, listen, there's plenty of time for counselors, but at 
             six o'clock locksmiths start charging extra, so you get on 
             it, girlfriend.  You know, my Grampa Willie used to say, 
             "Nothing stops a man from playing the field faster than a 
             night out on the lawn."  Okay?  Okay!
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you, Grampa Willie!
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Radio Station -- Some Time Later
    Mary is giving more counseling.
    _
       **Mary:** Looky here, Tony.  You're thirty-five years old.  Now, your 
             parents only had you for the first eighteen, so if you want 
             to start blaming someone, maybe you need to blame yourself. 
             Okay?  Okay!
    **Frasier:** Actually, chronic rage problems usually stem from childhood...
       **Mary:** All right, Dr. Crane, we're all out of time.
    **Frasier:**[_looks at clock_] So we are.  Well then, this is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane, saying goodbye Seattle, and good mental health. [_goes 
             to press button_]
       **Mary:** And tune in tomorrow!
    _Frasier angrily punches the button with a bemused look.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    The apartment is empty except for Daphne as she opens the door to 
    Niles who is carrying a certificate._
      **Niles:**[_full of the joys of spring_] Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, you're in a good mood today.
      **Niles:** Hmm-mm, after six long weeks I have finally received my 
             yellow belt.
     **Daphne:** Oh, aren't you lucky?  I ordered some more Capri pants two 
             months ago and I'm still waiting.
      **Niles:** No, no, no.  As this handsome certificate will attest, I've 
             finally attained the second level of kickboxing.
     **Daphne:** Oh, congratulations.  What made you take up kickboxing?
      **Niles:** Well, in order to protect Mel.  Er, as you know, she's a 
             plastic surgeon.  She has a habit of slipping her card to 
             total strangers who she feels could use her services.  So far 
             no harm done, but... [_pours sherry_]
     **Daphne:** But it's only a matter of time before you get your lights 
             punched out?
      **Niles:** Exactly.  It almost happened last week with Marjorie Dunsmore. 
             Luck was on our side, but next time there might not be a 
             walker to kick over, so... [_beat_] I think Dad'll be properly 
             impressed when I demonstrate my precision in footwork.
    _Niles demonstrates to Daphne and gets a little too close to the 
    Chihuly on the side._
     **Daphne:** Oh!  It's very impressive, Dr. Crane.  You know, I just 
             remembered the Chihuly needs a good dusting.
    **Frasier:**[_enters and notices_] Daphne, I thought you cleaned that 
             yesterday?
     **Daphne:** Oh, did I?
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Niles.  What brings you here?
      **Niles:** Here to demonstrate my newly acquired feet [_high kicks 
             shouting "hu-ho!"_] of fury!
    **Frasier:** Carry on, Daphne. [_pours a sherry as Daphne exits to the 
             kitchen and Martin enters and sits in his chair_]
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier, who was that woman on your show today?
    **Frasier:** Oh, that was Mary Thomas, she's filling in for Roz this 
             week.
     **Martin:** It seemed to me like she was filling for you!
      **Niles:** You're normally so particular about what happens on your 
             show.  I'm surprised you let her go on like that.
    **Frasier:** Well, I started to say something and then I thought, well, 
             it might be a bit condescending.
     **Martin:**[_sits_] I know why you didn't say anything; cause she's black!
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's ridiculous, Dad, race has nothing to do with it.
      **Niles:** Oh, come now, Frasier.  You can't deny a certain measure of 
             guilt, living as you do in your exclusive lily-white world.
    **Frasier:** Niles, owning the CD of "Ella sings Gershwin" does not 
             qualify you as a soul brother!
     **Martin:** You know, Frasier, there's such a thing as being too sensitive 
             about this stuff.  Now if it was Roz blabbing on instead of 
             this Mary, you'd tell her to put a sock in it, right?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose so, but, you know, this is different, Dad. 
             She's just starting out, I didn't want to squelch her 
             enthusiasm.
     **Martin:** Because she's black.
    **Frasier:** Dad, please, will you just stop saying that?  Anyway, I will 
             just have to deal with it for a week until Roz gets back.
     **Martin:** Black!
    **Frasier:** Stop it!
      **Niles:**[_suddenly after a pensive time_] My first roommate at Yale 
             was black!
    **Frasier:** Huntington Treadwell III!  It's hardly representative of the 
             African-American experience, Niles. 
      **Niles:** His father was a pioneer in Selma and Montgomery.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I believe he built golf courses all over the South!
    _Frasier exits as Niles stands with his certificate._
      **Niles:** Oh, speaking of golf, dad, I've become quite the sportsman 
             myself. [_hands him certificate_] What do you think of that?
     **Martin:** Oh, it's very nice, son, but calligraphy really isn't a 
             sport!  More of a craft.
      **Niles:** No, no, no, this is for kickboxing, I finally reached yellow 
             belt, Dad.
     **Martin:** He-hey, what do you know?  I'm proud of ya!
    _Martin puts his hand up for a high-five but Niles backs away in fear._
     **Martin:** No, come here. [_they high-five_]
      **Niles:** You know, it requires a lot of talent.  You have to have 
             timing and balance, the ability to strike and instantly 
             retreat.
     **Martin:**[_clarifying_] So you kick them and then run away?
      **Niles:** Yes.  My instructor says I'm a natural.  Can I show you 
             something?
     **Martin:**[_taking his beer onto another table for safety_] Yeah, sure.
      **Niles:** I'll show you a roundhouse kick, all right?
    _Niles does his maneuvers with his back to the kitchen.  Daphne enters 
    from the kitchen with a tray of snacks and watches Niles in admiration._
      **Niles:** You sense your assailant's presence. [_weird eye movement_] You 
             feel your body in the space. [_weird feet movement_] Know where 
             your opponent is and when you're ready... you strike!
    _Niles kicks behind him and inadvertently knocks Daphne flying onto 
    the table as she throws the bowl of snacks up behind her.  She lands 
    on her wrist as Niles goes to help her._
      **Niles:** What have I done?!
     **Martin:** Are you all right, Daphne?
     **Daphne:** Yes.
      **Niles:** Really?
     **Daphne:**[_cries_] No.  I landed on my wrist, it's really throbbing...
     **Martin:** Go get her some ice, Niles! [_he does_]
    _Frasier enters amongst the menagerie:_
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, perhaps you're right.  Maybe I am too 
             sensitive. [_the phone rings_] Daphne, could you get that, 
             please? 
    _Frasier exits to the kitchen as the rest look around at him.
    
    End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Radio Station.
    Frasier and Mary are coming towards the end of their show._
    **Frasier:** Gabe, you must remember that compulsive shopping is an 
             addiction.  There are no simple solutions.
       **Mary:** Oh, I've got one!  Cut those credit cards up right now.  Okay? 
             Okay!
       **Gabe:**[_v.o._] Thank you, Dr. Mary.
    **Frasier:** You know, I hate to be a stickler here, Gabe, but as Mary 
             would be the first to point out: she is not a doctor.
       **Mary:** Oh, I don't mind.  Call me Dr. Mary.  You know, Latifa's not a 
             real Queen, right?  
    
    [_N.B. Kim Coles starred with Queen Latifah on "Living Single."_]
    
       **Mary:** Oh, you know what, doll babies, we're all out of time for 
             today.
    **Frasier:**[_looks at clock_] So we are.  Well then, this is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane...
       **Mary:**...and Dr. Mary!
    **Frasier:** Saying goodbye Seattle and... [_quick_] good mental health. 
             [_presses button before she can open her mouth_]
    _Kenny enters._ 
      **Kenny:** Hey, guys. [_Mary enters to greet him_] Just checking in to 
             see how things are going.
       **Mary:** Are you kidding, it's a dream come true. [_exits to her booth_]
      **Kenny:**[_closes door between booths_] So, er, you and Mary, what do 
             you think of her?  Be honest.
    **Frasier:** Well, I genuinely like her, she's delightful and dedicated.
      **Kenny:** And...?
    **Frasier:** Well, em, she does have a tendency to just sort of jump right 
             in there whenever she likes, you know, and frankly, her method 
             of solving problems is totally different than mine. [_laughs to 
             cover fear of prejudice_]
      **Kenny:**[_genuine laugh_] Yeah, I'm nuts about her too. [_Mary enters_] 
             The contrast between you guys, that's what gets things 
             crackling.  I always thought that your show was the gold 
             standard of radio shrink chatter.  But this last week has 
             been even better!
    **Frasier:** You think so?
      **Kenny:** Absolutely!  In fact, the boys upstairs would like to make 
             you two a permanent team.  Oh, who am I kidding?  There are  
             no boys upstairs, I just love this show! [_imitating Mary_] 
             Okay?
       **Mary:** Oh, this is so exciting, I cannot believe it. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, me neither!
      **Kenny:** And don't you worry about Roz.  I'm just going to switch her 
             over to Gil's show.  The hours are better and I'll even throw 
             in a twenty percent raise!  Ah, this is going be great!  I bet 
             within a month you guys are going to have the hottest 
             ratings in Seattle!
       **Mary:** Oh, this is so wonderful, thank you both, really.  I'm going 
             to go call my parents. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Listen, Kenny...
      **Kenny:** I know what you're feeling right now, Doc, and let me save 
             you the trouble. [_opens arms_] Come here, big guy! 
    _Kenny hugs Frasier in enthusiasm as Mary enters._
       **Mary:** I want some too!
    _Mary flings herself around Frasier, sandwiching him in. 
    
    We CUT TO: the streets of Seattle again.  This time the tram has a 
    large picture of Frasier and a small picture of Mary with the caption, 
    "Frasier Crane featuring Dr. Mary"
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles has taken on Daphne's role in the apartment.  He has got Daphne 
    settled on the couch whilst Martin sits in his chair.  Niles gives 
    Daphne a quiche._
      **Niles:** Everything comfy, Daphne?  There you are.  This quiche should 
             hold you 'til dinner.
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, you really don't need to fill in for me, it's just 
             a sprained wrist.  I'm perfectly capable of cooking dinner.
     **Martin:** The hell you are!
      **Niles:** Daphne, it is the least I can do, believe me.  Until you're 
             fully recovered, consider me your full-time stand-in.  Oh, 
             which reminds me, Dad.  I rented your favorite video. [_hands 
             it to him_]
     **Martin:**[_cheerful_] Oh-ho, "Death Wish."
      **Niles:** Oh, I'll get your beer, I'm just frosting the mug in the 
             freezer the way Daphne does. 
    _He exits to the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** I never frost your beer mug!
     **Martin:** Oh, be quiet, will you?  He's feeling very guilty and we have 
             to help him work through it.
     **Daphne:** That is just baloney, and you know it.  Shame on you, taking 
             advantage of your son, I don't know how you sleep at night!
     **Martin:** Well, pretty good since he started putting a mint on my 
             pillow and a cup of cocoa by the bed.
     **Daphne:** He never leaves me cocoa.
     **Martin:** You have to fill out that little card.
     **Daphne:** Oh.
    _Daphne exits to her room as Niles enters with Martin's snacks. 
    Frasier also enters from the outside hallway._
     **Martin:** Oh, Fras, how did the show go?
    **Frasier:**[_gives him a look_] It was very educational.  Today, Mary 
             taught us how to manipulate our husbands... by withholding 
             sex.  And she taught us how to lie to our children about the 
             past.
     **Martin:**[_laughs with Niles_] Boy, that Dr. Mary sure goes on and on.
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] For the last time! - she is not a doctor, no matter 
             how many times she refers to herself as one.  "A cat can have 
             kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits!" 
             [_realizes_] Dear God, now I'm quoting Grampa Willie!
    
    [_N.B. The drier version of this saying which Frasier might well already 
    know would be the Duke of Wellington's aphorism that "a man may be born
    in a stable, that doesn't make him a horse."  He grew fond of saying it
    in response to questions about whether he considered himself Irish or 
    English._]
    
      **Niles:** For heaven's sake, Frasier, why don't you just talk to her?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a delicate situation, Niles.  For God's sake, it's 
             not all that easy.  I mean, she is new to the field, she's 
             sensitive, she's eager to please...
     **Martin:** She's black!
    **Frasier:** Dad, please!
     **Martin:** Well, you know damn well that's what this whole thing's about.  
             I don't know what the big deal is, if she's talking too much, 
             just tell her to shut her big bazoo.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  How do you suggest I accomplish that without 
             sounding like a complete bigot?
      **Niles:** Well, perhaps a little diplomacy is in order.
    **Frasier:** Oh, are you saying I should just choose my words more 
             carefully, is that it?
      **Niles:** Yes, exactly.
    **Frasier:**[_hot under the collar_] Fine, fine, all right, Niles.  Just 
             exactly how would that go?!  Why don't you play me and I'll 
             be Mary.
      **Niles:** All right. [_calm_] Er, Mary?
    **Frasier:**[_quick_] Frasier!
      **Niles:** I've been meaning to speak to you.  You know, people listen 
             to the show for my expertise.
    **Frasier:** Oh, so my opinion's not worth anything?
      **Niles:** Well, I'm the one with the medical degree.  Now I want you to 
             contribute, but only up to a point.
    **Frasier:** So, you want me to stay in my place, Massa!
      **Niles:** She's not going to say "Massa"...
    _Frasier throws in stereotypical African-American woman speech and 
    gestures, including the neck rolling._
    **Frasier:** What, am I getting too uppity for you?  You sherry-swelling, 
             opera-loving, Armani-wearing elitist!  You have no idea how 
             difficult it is for a black woman in a white man's world!
      **Niles:** Frasier...
    **Frasier:** I don't think so! [_breaking up_] Look at me!  This is 
             ridiculous.  I have walked myself straight into a mine 
             field!
      **Niles:** Listen, Frasier.  I know you're trying to be sensitive, but 
             you're not showing this woman any respect if you're not as 
             honest with her as you would be with someone else.
     **Martin:** Right, this is your show.  When she gets her own show she can 
             say whatever she wants.
    **Frasier:**[_realizes_] Wait a minute!  You know what, Dad, you may be 
             onto something there.  Gosh, I don't know why I didn't think 
             of that myself.  You know what, I'm just going to call Kenny 
             and tell him to give her her own show.  They're looking for 
             a replacement for "Let's Go Camping With Dan & Jenny."
     **Martin:** What happened to them?
    **Frasier:** They don't know. [_on phone_] Kenny, it's Frasier.  Listen, 
             I've been thinking.  You know what, I think I'm holding Mary 
             back.  You know, a talent like hers should not be stuck in a 
             producer's chair. [_happy to Niles and Martin_] He agrees 
             with me!
    _Niles and Martin look at each other in satisfaction.
    
    SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three - Radio Station.
    However, Kenny got the wrong end of the stick it seems as now Mary 
    and Frasier are both in the talent's booth on the same show._
       **Mary:**[_to microphone_] Oh, I'll tell you what you do, you snap out of 
             it.  You know why you're afraid to get married?  You think 
             there's some room full of hoochy mommas out there that's 
             waiting for you, in case you don't want to do the right thing. 
             Let me tell you something, the only thing you're missing out 
             on is a lot of cold and lonely nights and I tell you what, 
             there's not one person out there that would disagree with me 
             on that.
    _However, Louise, the new African-American call screener seems to._
     Louise: I do!  I don't think he deserves that girl and if he's not 
             man enough to take that leap of faith then she's better off 
             without him!
       **Mary:** Louise, is you trippin'?  Girls...
    _Louise and Mary start arguing over each other.  Frasier sits silently 
    between the two and in boredom takes a bite of cheese.  
    
    We then CUT BACK TO the Seattle tram.  Now it's advertisement has Mary 
    and Frasier standing back to back with a little picture of Louise.  It 
    now reads "They're Listening!"
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier is having a coffee as Roz enters and sits with him.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.  I listened to your show for about twenty 
             minutes today, I didn't hear your voice.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm playing a diminished role these days.  Although 
             still an important one.  I am the glue that holds the show 
             together - or as Mary said in her intro, "The filling in our 
             little Oreo."
        **Roz:** Well, it's no picnic working with Gil either.  You know that 
             little joke that he makes before every show that his taste 
             buds are insured?
    **Frasier:** Mmm.
        **Roz:** They really are!
    **Frasier:** Oh!
        **Roz:** Guess who had to take the claims photo after he had to eat a 
             hot slice of pizza?
    **Frasier:** Oh God, Roz, I'm so sorry.
        **Roz:** You should be.  I go away for a week and you give away our 
             whole show!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know. [_Mary enters_] Oh, Lord, there she is.  You know 
             what, I could have nipped this whole thing in the bud if I'd 
             just been honest with her from the beginning.  You know what, 
             perhaps the time's come for me to just tell her the truth.
        **Roz:** Well, it sounds like an intense conversation.  I think I'll 
             get out of here and give you a little room.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Roz.
    _Roz moves to the next table from which she can easily eavesdrop._
    **Frasier:** Roz! 
    _Roz leaves to the back of the caf e.
    _
       **Mary:**[_comes over_] Hey there, partner.  Is there room for one more 
             at the doctor's table?
    **Frasier:** Of course, Mary.  Listen, there is something I want to talk 
             to you about.
       **Mary:** Oh, I don't doubt it.  Could you believe Louise today?  She 
             just would not stop talking, would she?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not Louise...
       **Mary:** Every time I turned around she's just yappity, yappity, 
             yappity, yap.  I mean, what is her training anyway?
    **Frasier:** Mary, please, just stop it, stop it.  Please, the problem is 
             not with Louise, it's with you.
       **Mary:** What?
    **Frasier:** Well, the truth is, I... I don't enjoy working with you.  
             I haven't enjoyed working with you from the start. We have 
             different styles and I have absolutely no respect for the 
             advice that you give.
       **Mary:** I... I had no idea.  Well, why didn't you just say something 
             before?
    **Frasier:**[_pause_] Well, it's because you're black. [_she realizes_] And 
             the truth is that I was afraid that if I said something 
             critical of you, you might react the wrong way... and I 
             feel just terrible about it.
       **Mary:** Maybe you shouldn't feel so bad because...
    **Frasier:** No, no, actually, I should.  You see, I pride myself on being 
             able to communicate with just about anybody, and I couldn't 
             even be honest with you.
       **Mary:** Oh, it's not that easy.  You didn't want to disappoint me, I 
             understand.  If you don't like the show the way it is right 
             now then that comes first.  Like Grampa Willie used to say, 
             "If the shoe don't fit then that ain't your shoe."
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, as much as I've come to loathe Grampa 
             Willie, that does actually make me feel a little better.
       **Mary:** You know, I'll let you in on a little secret.  All those 
             expressions?  I made them up myself. [_laughs_] I'll give you 
             another reason not to feel so bad about all this.  Today, 
             KPXY offered me my own show.  I'm going to be just fine on my 
             own.
    **Frasier:** Mary, that's wonderful news.  So, you forgive me?
       **Mary:** Well, I think you could have been honest with me.  Then again, 
             if you'd told me to be quiet then I'd be back at the bakery.  
             Instead, I've got this brand-new career and this afternoon I'm 
             shopping for cars.  So I guess what I'm saying is... God bless 
             your guilty white ass!  Okay?
    _Mary kisses him on his forehead leaving a lipstick mark and then 
    exits.  Frasier wipes it off as Roz arrives at his table._
        **Roz:** So, how'd it go?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, better than I expected.  I guess we're a team 
             again, Roz.
        **Roz:** Great. [_they shake hands_] Well, you'll have to wait a little 
             while.  I've got to stay with Gil at least until we find 
             another replacement.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, of course.  Well, I can find somebody.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Radio Station.
    Frasier is doing his show._
    **Frasier:** Thank you for your call, Jill.  Well, Chuck, who else is on 
             the line?
    _It seems Frasier has hired Chuck Ranberg to act as his producer._
      **Chuck:** Weww, Doctaw Cwane, we have Winda on wine fwee who bewieves 
             peopew are waffing at hew.
    **Frasier:**[_containing his laughter_] Maybe we can just come back to 
             that one, shall we? 
      **Chuck:** All wightey!
    _Frasier controls his laughter again as we FADE OUT.
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne is in her bed reading "To Love And Let Go" (rather apt for her 
    situation, don't you think?) when Niles comes, obeying Daphne's 
    little card, with a cup of hot cocoa.  He hands it over and notices 
    the book.  She is having some trouble turning the pages with the 
    bandage on her hand.
    
    He takes it and begins to read it to her.  It looks like she 
    is really enjoying his company. However, Martin then comes in asking 
    for his cocoa and tears Niles away from Daphne, to the disappointment 
    of both of them.
