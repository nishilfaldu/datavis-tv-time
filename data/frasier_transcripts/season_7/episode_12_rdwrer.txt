    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier is sat with a coffee when Roz enters and sits with him.
    _
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz.  Happy New Year. [_they hug_] Or should I say 
             "Happy New Millennium?"
        **Roz:** Oh, barf, I'm so sick of talking about it. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, now Roz, let's not condemn the new Millennium just because 
             you woke up in it with a hangover.  That's what ruined church 
             for you.
        **Roz:**[_to waiter_] Decaf latte, please. [_to Frasier_] I just hate how 
             this arbitrary point on the calendar has become so significant.  
             And as far as my hangover went, it was worth it.  I partied my 
             ass off like a brain-damaged test monkey!
    **Frasier:** I see.  Well, allow me to congratulate you on your first 
             science-related metaphor.
        **Roz:** Thank you.  And what did you do?  Get all freaky and finish 
             your list of the century's greatest thinkers?
    **Frasier:** No, my New Year's was plenty exciting enough, thank you very
             much!  Although not exactly in the way I'd planned...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    We flashback to the 30th of December 1999.  The apartment is still 
    decorated for Christmas, Martin is sat in his chair as Frasier opens 
    the door to an anxious Niles._
      **Niles:** Cancel the Millennium!  "Chez Henri" has burned down!
    **Frasier:** Burned down?!
      **Niles:** Yes!  Apparently, Henri was caramelizing a huge cr�me br�l�e 
             in the shape of Puget Sound, when a sugar spark ignited a 
             thirty-foot paper mache "Space Needle."  They're already 
             calling it the worst centerpiece disaster in the history 
             of Seattle. 
    **Frasier:** Henri built his reputation with that caramelizing torch.  
             My God, the irony of him burning down his own restaurant 
             with it.  It's worthy of "Oh! Henry."
      **Niles:** "Oh! Henri." [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Please, Niles, it's too soon to joke.  What exactly are we 
             going to do tomorrow night?  Every restaurant in town worth 
             going to has been booked for months.
     **Martin:** Well, you know, you can join me and the boys at McGinty's. 
             It's going to be a lot of fun, they're going to dye the beer 
             green.
      **Niles:** Why would you do that on New Year's Eve?
     **Martin:** Oh well, McGinty's going in for a bypass next month and 
             he's afraid he might not make it out for St. Paddy's Day. 
      **Niles:** This is a disaster!
     **Martin:** No, they'll just pop in another pig valve.  You know, the 
             only reason he needs it is because he eats so much bacon. 
             So, the same thing that's killing him is keeping him alive. 
             [_laughs_] There's your "Oh! Henry" story.
      **Niles:** Well, maybe we can just stay in tomorrow night.
    **Frasier:** On the most significant New Year's Eve of our lifetime?!  
             I think not! 
      **Niles:** I should have just gone with Mel.  She and her mother are 
             taking a hot air balloon through the wine country. [_Martin 
             and Frasier look at him_] Well, not in the balloon, no, but 
             I could have followed along in the recovery vehicle.
    **Frasier:** Wait a minute!  Speaking of wine, wasn't the wine club having 
             some sort of a party?
      **Niles:** Yes, at Ken Lauerbock's place in Sun Valley.  Oh, it's a 
             huge event.
    **Frasier:** Of course, "Auld Lang Wine!"  Niles, call to see if we're 
             still invited.
      **Niles:** All right, I'm on it.
    _Niles exits to the kitchen whilst using his mobile as Daphne enters 
    with some mail.  She isn't too thrilled._
     **Daphne:** Bloody hell!  Five days after Christmas is over and I'm still 
             getting these cards!  They do it on purpose, you know.  It's 
             always from someone you forgot, and then it's too late to send 
             one back, then they sneer at you for the rest of the year! 
             [_reads card_] "Peace and Goodwill," my ass!  You just lost 
             yourself a customer, Dr. Naran S. Gupta, D.D.S.! 
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic_] Losing a set of English teeth, he'll feel that!
    _She scowls and drops an envelope into his lap._
     **Daphne:** This is for you, from the DMV.
     **Martin:** Oh-ho, I know what this is!  The custom plates I ordered for 
             my Winnebago! [_takes them out_] Yay!  Well, fifty bucks, but I 
             think it says it all.
    _Frasier and Daphne try to make sense of the plates that read "RDWRER"._
    **Frasier:** "Erd... Whirr-Er"?
     **Daphne:** "Rid-Worr-Yer"?
    **Frasier:** "Red Wearer"!
     **Martin:** Oh, for God's sake!  "Road Warrior"!
     **Daphne:** Of course! [_sarcastic_] For a retired man with a cane and a
             Winnebago, I don't know why my mind didn't go straight to it!
    _Niles re-enters from the kitchen._
      **Niles:** Huzzah! [_to Daphne_] Hello, Daphne. [_to Frasier_] Ken said he'd 
             love to have us come and [_to Martin_] the more the merrier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, that's brilliant.  Dad, please, please, won't you 
             join us?  You know what, say, let's call the travel agent.
     **Daphne:** Not to rain on your parade, but you may have a tough time 
             getting flights this late.  Donny and I had a devil of a time 
             getting our flights to San Francisco.
    **Frasier:** Oh Daphne, they always set aside a few choice seats for 
             Seattle's travel elite. 
    _Niles gleefully begins dialing his cell phone.
    
    SMASH CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three - The Winnebago.
    We quickly cut to the following day.  It seems that the Crane brothers 
    aren't amongst the travel elite as they ride down to Sun Valley with 
    Martin and Eddie.  A motorist beeps them from behind._
    **Motorist:**[_v.o._] Pick a lane, Road Warrior!
      **Martin:** See, he got it!  He-hee! [_Martin puts his thumb up at him in 
              glee_]
    _FADE OUT_
    **ARE WE THERE YET?**
    _Scene Four - The Winnebago.
    A little while later, the Crane gang are still driving.  It is still 
    daytime.  Frasier is now behind the wheel, Martin is in the passenger 
    seat with Eddie whilst Niles is in a separate seat with the map._
     **Martin:** Being on the road like this, it's like we're three dusty hobos 
             sharing a box-car to parts unknown.
      **Niles:** Yes, well, if you don't take this next turn we'll end up in 
             "Californy."
    **Frasier:** Gee, Niles, you seem a little cranky.
      **Niles:** Well, perhaps that's because I was rousted out of a warm bed 
             at the crack of dawn and herded onto a Winnebago!
     **Martin:** Better safe than sorry, Niles.  You know, it's 650 miles to 
             Sun Valley, and half of that's through the mountains.
      **Niles:** By the way, how are we going to explain to the wine club our 
             arriving in a Winnebago?
    **Frasier:** Just chalk it off to whimsy, Niles.  We'll call it our "Van 
             Ordinaire!" [_laughs_] You know, besides, I'm actually enjoying 
             this little trip through the heartland.  I feel a bit out of 
             touch with the common man, it's nice to reconnect.
      **Niles:** Well, while you're reconnecting, why don't you let me drive?
    _Frasier and Martin give each other a look of horror._
    **Frasier:** I would, Niles.  It's just that, em... I need you to navigate.
     **Martin:** Yeah, you're the most important member of our crew, good 
             buddy!
    **Frasier:** The man with the map!
      **Niles:** Stop patronizing me, I want to drive.
     **Martin:** Oh, you're not good with big cars, Niles.  Remember when I 
             tried to teach you to drive my LeSabre?  You kept panicking 
             and pulling on the emergency brake.
      **Niles:** Well, it's a good thing I did.  Those mailboxes weren't even 
             slowing me down!
    _Martin notices something out of the window._
     **Martin:** Oh, did you see that sign?  "Little Red Cabin."  Do you 
             remember those diners? [_laughs_] "Home of the Log Roller: 
             a flank steak wrapped around a combination of eggs, cheese 
             and onions!"  You kids used to love eating there.  You'd 
             scream out at me, "Dad, pull over.  Quick, pull over!"
    **Frasier:** Actually, Dad, that was after we ate!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - The Winnebago.
    It's sometime later.  Frasier is alone in the cabin.  He's driving 
    whilst humming along to some classical music on the stereo.  Niles 
    enters from the sleeping area.  He looks very tired._
    **Frasier:**[_noticing Niles_] Oh, Niles. [_turns stereo off_] I thought 
             you were sleeping.
    _We then hear a very loud guffaw from the sleeping quarters, it's 
    Martin._
      **Niles:** I was trying to, but Dad wanted to watch the VCR.
    **Frasier:** Oh, good Lord, not "Robin and the Seven Hoods" again.
    _Martin is heard laughing again._
      **Niles:** Worse.
    _Martin enters._
     **Martin:** Yeah, baby, you know, that was a shag-a-delic flick!
    _The Crane brothers look at each other._
      **Niles:** You know, dad, if you're quite done, I think I'll try to take 
             a nap.
     **Martin:**[_Austin-Powers-ish_] Oh, beeehave!
    _Niles exits to the sleeping quarters as Martin takes his seat._
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, you do realize that the "Austin Powers" craze 
             is completely over!
     **Martin:** Well, I'm sorry, do I bore you?  Or do I make you randy? 
             [_laughs_]
    _Frasier's mobile rings.  He answers._
    **Frasier:**[_to phone_] Hello.  Yes, Niles.  I'm driving as smoothly as I 
             can.  Any other little driving tips you'd like to give me, 
             [_shouts back to the quarters_] why don't you just come up 
             here and tell me to my face! [_hangs up_]
     **Martin:** Hey, look, another "Little Red Cabin" sign.  You know, we're 
             not going to find anything better to eat on this highway.
    **Frasier:** Oh, let's not be hasty, Dad.  It's five miles away, we might 
             run over something before then!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - A Little Red Cabin.
    Niles, Frasier and Martin are sat in the diner reading the menus. 
    They are sat below a huge window overlooking the car-park.  Road 
    Warrior is parked right outside the window._
      **Niles:** You know, I am so tired, I can barely read this menu.
    **Frasier:** It's all right, Niles.  You don't have to read.  You can just 
             point to a picture of the food you want!
     **Martin:** What's this?  "A Log Roller with your choice of cheese."  
             You can't have a Log Roller without American cheese!
    **Frasier:** Apparently you can't get anything in this restaurant without 
             American cheese.  Including the menu! [_wipes cheese off menu_]
    _Another Winnebago, identical to the Road Warrior, pulls up in front 
    of the RW.  An elderly couple gets out of it._
     **Martin:** Niles, if you're so tired, why don't you go back to the Road 
             Warrior and take a nap?
      **Niles:** Oh, you know, that's a good idea.  At least it'll be quiet. 
             [_rises_]
     **Martin:** I wonder if you can still get Sticky Shingles here?
      **Niles:** One look at the salad bar says yes. [_exits_]
     **Martin:** What looks good to you, Fras?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, Dad, you know, I think I'll have a hamburger.
    _We see Niles outside getting onto the wrong Winnebago._
    **Frasier:** Would you order that for me, Dad?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  You're going some place?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I am.  I'm going to take a chance and 
             reacquaint myself with an old friend of mine: America.
    _Martin groans as Frasier approaches a farmer sitting at the bar._
    **Frasier:** Hello there. [_sits with him_] Could I buy you a cup of 
             coffee?  You see, I'm just a wandering city mouse, trying to 
             get in touch with America.  Now, you, you look like you be a 
             farmer.
     **Farmer:** Oh, I get it.  You see a guy in a rural diner wearing shabby 
             clothes and you pin your little label on him.  Well guess 
             what, I am a farmer, but I'm also a beautiful, flawed, 
             complicated human being and it's going to take more than a 
             cup of coffee to get inside here.
    **Frasier:** I'll just go see how my father's doing.
    _Frasier walks back to Martin and sits._
     **Martin:** How was he?
    **Frasier:** Beautiful, flawed, unpleasant.
     **Martin:** Well, according to the map it's about three hundred miles to 
             Sun Valley.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's delightful, Dad.  You know what, we'll get there in 
             plenty of time for the party.
     **Martin:** Now listen, you know, your brother's going to be hungry, 
             maybe we should bring him a sandwich.
    **Frasier:** I wouldn't worry about Niles, Dad.
    _Meanwhile, the couple return to their Winnebago and drive away with 
    the sleeping Niles._
    **Frasier:** He's so tired, let's just let him sleep for the rest of the 
             trip.
     **Martin:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** Oh sure.  It's the most exciting day of the year, Dad.  For 
             God's sakes, you know, when Niles wakes up I guarantee the 
             last thing he'll be thinking about is sandwiches!
    _End of Act One.
    
    Act Two._
    **ARE WE THERE YET?**
    _Scene One - The Wrong Winnebago.
    An old woman, Betty, and her husband, Clifford, are driving the 
    Winnebago that Niles has fallen asleep in._
       **Betty:** Oh my goodness.  Look what I just found in my pocket, the 
              lighter I borrowed from that waitress in the restaurant.  
              I feel terrible!
    **Clifford:** Forget it, Mother.  We're not taking it back.
    _Meanwhile, Niles wakes up in the sleeping quarters and hears the rest 
    of the conversation.  He is alarmed._
       **Betty:** Well, I really think we should just turn around and say 
              we're sorry and return it.
    **Clifford:** I think we ought to keep it.  Our old one's nearly out of 
              fuel anyway.
       **Betty:** It doesn't make it right.  We're still criminals in the eyes 
              of the law.
    **Clifford:** There's a lot worse criminals than you and me.  Do you 
              remember that last gun show we went to?  We must have seen 
              at least three different people swiping boxes of shells.
       **Betty:** There's one thing you can say for us, we pay for our ammo!
    _Niles, in panic, crouches in the corner and takes out his cell phone.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Two - The Winnebago.
    Frasier is driving as Martin chats to him._
     **Martin:** So at this party tonight, there going to be a lot of 
             shagnificent birds?!
    **Frasier:** Dad, I'm begging you.
    _Frasier's mobile sounds.  He answers._
    **Frasier:** Hello? [_peeved_] Niles, would you please stop doing this! 
             [_hangs up_]
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three - The Wrong Winnebago.
    Meanwhile, Clifford and Betty are still going._
    **Clifford:** I'm getting a little drowsy.
       **Betty:** Well, if you're so tired, just scootch over, I'll take the 
              wheel.
    _The two change seats. Niles meanwhile phones the police._
      **Niles:** Yes, yes, hello.  I'm being kidnapped, this is an emergency,  
             I'm being kidnapped.  I'm in a stolen Winnebago heading east 
             on I-84.  I can't talk any louder, I'm being stolen.  Yes, 
             yes.  Washington plates, R-D-W-R-E-R: Road Warrior.  Yes, it 
             does.  It does so, sound it out.  Oh, never mind, for God's 
             sake, just save me!
    _Meanwhile, Clifford stands up._
    **Clifford:** You know what, I'm getting sleepy, I'm going back for a 
              little lie-down.
       **Betty:** All right. [_as Clifford is just about to enter the sleeping 
              quarters_] Oh wait Dad, look, there's another one of those 
              "Little Red Cabin"'s.  Why don't we just stop and have some 
              supper first?
    **Clifford:** 'Cause I'm tired and I'm not hungry.
       **Betty:**[_sternly_] Clifford!
    **Clifford:** Well, I guess a sandwich wouldn't kill me.
       **Betty:** I feel sort of funny even stopping here, it's a little like
              returning to the scene of the crime. 
    **Clifford:** Mother!  Let it go!
    _The couple exit the Winnebago, leaving the keys in the roof visor.  
    Niles appears from the back and cautiously climbs into the driving 
    seat.  He adjusts his mirror and starts the engine before driving off.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Four - The Winnebago.
    Martin and Frasier have come to a halt.  Martin exits with Eddie into 
    the woods._
     **Martin:** All right, Eddie.  Let's go sign nature's guest book!
    _Meanwhile, Frasier's mobile rings.  He answers it._
    **Frasier:** Hello.
      **Niles:**[_v.o._] Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
      **Niles:** Niles. 
    _Throughout the following the camera switches between Niles driving 
    the wrong Winnebago and Frasier in the Road Warrior._
      **Niles:** Put your fears to rest, I've got Dad's Winnebago back!
    **Frasier:** Niles, what on earth are you talking about?  You must have 
             had a nightmare?
      **Niles:** Indeed I have, but it's over now and I've managed to give 
             the thugs a taste of their own thieving medicine!
    _Frasier goes to the sleeping quarters and pulls back the curtains. 
    No one is there.  Frasier gasps._
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Niles, where are you calling from?
      **Niles:** From behind the wheel of the "Road Warrior" and doing a damn 
             fine job driving it too, I might add.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm in the "Road Warrior"!  You got in the wrong car, 
             you idiot!  You've stolen a Winnebago!
      **Niles:** Don't be absurd.
    _Niles looks around his Winnebago.  He sees a photo of Betty and 
    Clifford on the wall.  He whimpers in apprehension.  
    
    He notices an ash tray on the dashboard and whimpers again.
    
    He picks up a personalized coffee mug -- "World's Greatest Grandma."
    _
      **Niles:** OH MY GOD!
    _While he has been distracted, the Winnebago has veered.  Returning his 
    attention to the road, he desperately hauls the wheel back, then panics
    and pulls on the emergency break.  The Winnebago screeches to a stop 
    and Niles falls out of his seat._
    **Frasier:** All right, Niles.  Just keep your head, there's no need to 
             panic!
    **Officer:**[_o.s., over loudspeaker_] This is the police!  Exit the vehicle 
             immediately with your hands above your head.
    _Frasier drops his mobile, raises his hands and exits.  Outside he finds 
    Martin standing up against the side of the van, and also little Eddie 
    with his paws above his head.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - The Little Red Cabin.
    Meanwhile, Betty and Clifford are still eating their meal._
       **Betty:** How's that turkey club, Dad?
    **Clifford:** A little dry.
    _Niles parks the Winnebago in the lot and gets out.  He cautiously 
    walks past the window and enters the cabin.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - The Winnebago.
    The officer is explaining to the Crane men._
    **Officer:** Sorry about the misunderstanding.  These papers all check out, 
             sir. [_hands them over_]
     **Martin:** Well, if there's nothing else, we're in a hurry to get to 
             Sun Valley.
    **Frasier:** But, not too much of a hurry. [_laughs_]
    **Officer:** Well, drive safely.
     **Martin:** Thank you.
    _The policeman exits._
     **Martin:** What a clown.  I can tell you ten things he did wrong right 
             off the bat. 
    **Frasier:** Well, at least he was apologetic. 
     **Martin:** Oh, these hick towns give any bozo a badge. [_the officer 
             appears at the window and overhears_] A goober like that 
             wouldn't last ten minutes in a real police force. [_notices 
             the peeved officer_] ...without getting a promotion!
    **Officer:** Your license! [_hands it over_]
    _Frasier drives off.  Frasier's mobile sounds and he answers.  The scene
    cuts back and forth between him and Niles, using his mobile near the 
    pay phone in the restaurant._
    **Frasier:** Hello.
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.  I managed to solve the problem, I returned 
             the Winnebago.
    **Frasier:** To where?  Where are you?
      **Niles:** Well, I'm in Baker City, Oregon.
    **Frasier:** Baker City?!
     **Martin:** Shag me rotten!  That's three hundred miles!
    **Frasier:** Niles, we will never get there and then back to Sun Valley 
             before midnight.
      **Niles:** Well I'm not going to ring in the new year in a "Little Red 
             Cabin."
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, listen, the only way we can ever pull 
             this off is if you can catch a ride in this direction.
      **Niles:** Hold on, hold on.
    _In the Little Red Cabin, Niles uses the pay phone as a cover for 
    eavesdropping on Betty and Clifford who are just leaving._
       **Betty:**[_looking at lighter_] Oh my gosh, it's engraved.  Dad, I'm 
              not going to enjoy the rest of this trip until I return this 
              woman's lighter.
    **Clifford:** Mother, do you expect me to turn around and drive a hundred 
              and fifty miles back to that Little Red Cabin?  We are not 
              going, end of discussion.
       **Betty:** Clifford.
    _Clifford has to give in._
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] Good news, I'm on my way. [_hangs up_]
    _CUT TO: The Winnebago._
    **Frasier:** Niles says he can make it back to the restaurant where we 
             first got separated, all I have to do now is to turn this boat 
             around.
     **Martin:** Thirty miles to the next exit.
    **Frasier:** I can't wait that long!
     **Martin:** Well, you can't do a U-ey on an interstate.
    **Frasier:** That's twentieth century talk, Dad.  Welcome to the future!
    _We then see the Winnebago cut across the grass and into the other 
    lane.  However, a police car is following them._
    **Frasier:** God, that felt great!  Wow, this is really quite an adventure, 
             isn't it, Dad!
    _The police turn their sirens on._
     **Martin:** It is now.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God.
     **Martin:** All right, just relax, Frasier.  Now, I know cops.  Just let 
             me do the talking, and we'll be out of here in two minutes.
    **Frasier:** All right Dad, let's switch.
    _Martin moves into the driving seat.  The police officer comes to the 
    window, it is the same one that arrested them earlier._
    **Officer:** Well, look who's here.  Do you boys know what you did wrong 
             back there?
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, I know, a U-turn.
    **Officer:** Nope, called me a goober!
    _Martin and Frasier look worried.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **LATER THE SAME MILLENNIUM**
    _Scene Seven - The Little Red Cabin.
    Niles is sat in the cabin looking very bored.  A large waitress is on 
    the tills as Frasier and Martin walk in._
    **Frasier:** Niles, I'm so sorry we're late.
      **Niles:** Ah, well.  Not to worry, when you're here at the cross-roads 
             of the world you have the human drama to amuse you.
     **Martin:** Well, happy new year, boys.
    **Frasier:** Yes, five minutes ago!  Everyone in the world will have a 
             wonderful story to tell about where they were and what they 
             were doing when the Millennium dawned.  What is our story? 
             Speeding along a lonely highway [_to Niles_] and you here 
             doing nothing.
      **Niles:** Well, not exactly nothing.  Big Sandy let me watch the 
             register while she emptied the rat traps.
     **Martin:** Hey, wait a minute, where are we?
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, I've never seen a picture of the official middle 
             of nowhere, but I assume...
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the middle of nowhere, Mountain Time, 
             right?  It's still only 11:05 Pacific Time.
      **Niles:** Which can't be more than forty-five minutes from here.
     **Martin:** Right!  We can cross the line and toast in the new year.
    **Frasier:** Dad, that's brilliant!  And there was a delightful little 
             restaurant just across the border.
     **Martin:** Well, the guide book said it was pretentious.
    **Frasier:** Perfect, let's roll!
    _The three exit the cabin.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Eight - The Winnebago.
    Martin is driving.  They are all dressed smartly in tuxedoes 
    (even Eddie)._
    **Frasier:** We're running out of time!
     **Martin:** Well, I'm doing my best, Frasier, but we seem to be losing 
             power.
    **Frasier:** What's that noise?  What's wrong with the engine?
      **Niles:** I didn't touch the emergency brake!
     **Martin:** When's the last time you put gas in this thing?
    **Frasier:** Me?!  I don't even know where the thing is to put the gas 
             into.
     **Martin:** Oh, no.  I'm sorry, boys.  It's dying, I'm going to be lucky 
             to get this off the road.
    **Frasier:** I can't stand this!  Have we so offended the Millennium gods 
             that they will do anything to ruin this evening?  Burn down 
             our restaurant?  Hurl vindictive lawmen and duplicate 
             Winnebagos in our path to confound us?!
     **Martin:**[_looks out of window_] Hey, is that a sign?
    **Frasier:** Of course it's a sign!  It's a sign that we're cursed!
     **Martin:** No, no, it is, it's a sign!  
    _Out the window we see a sign that says "Entering Pacific Time Zone."_
     **Martin:** We're entering Pacific Time Zone!  We're here!
    **Frasier:** We made it!  Come on, Eddie! [_checks his watch_] Thirty seconds 
             to spare.
    _The three gather round the champagne but the vehicle begins to roll 
    back._
    **Frasier:** We're rolling!  We're rolling backwards.
     **Martin:** Oh, no!
      **Niles:** No need to panic, Frasier. 
    _He pulls the emergency brake, the Winnebago stops._
      **Niles:** Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
     **Martin:** We rolled back into Idaho!
    **Frasier:** Follow me!
    _Frasier grabs the champagne bottle out of the bucket and they all rush 
    out of the Winnebago with Eddie and run up past the sign._
    **Frasier:** Ten seconds, let's look alive. [_tries to open the champagne_] 
             Damn this foil!
     **Martin:** You can do it, Fras, relax and focus.
      **Niles:** Three, two, one....
    _Frasier pops the champagne cork._
     **Martin:** Oh-ho, we made it!  Happy New Year!
    **Frasier/Niles:** Happy New Year!
    _Niles hands out paper cups, and Frasier pours them all a drink._
      **Niles:** Well, if you ask me, this beats a dull party.  
     **Martin:** Yeah...
      **Niles:** Family and good champagne and a blanket of stars.
    **Frasier:**[_raises his cup_] Hear, hear. 
    _They all sip._
    **Frasier:** You know what, I think this calls for a song. [_sings_] 
             "Should auld acquaintance be forgot..."
        **All:** "...and never brought to mind.  Should-"
    _However, in the winds they hear coyotes howling.  Eddie runs back into 
    the Winnebago.  Scared, the three follow him, finishing the lyrics._
        **All:**[_rapidly_] "Should-old-acquaintance-be-forgot-for-Auld-Lang-
             Syne..."
    _They slam the door on the further sound of howling.
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles is behind the wheel of the "Road Warrior."  Martin is teaching 
    him how to drive and it seems he is doing well.  However, Frasier then 
    walks up to the window with a petrol tank.  It seems the Winnebago was 
    stationary all the time.
