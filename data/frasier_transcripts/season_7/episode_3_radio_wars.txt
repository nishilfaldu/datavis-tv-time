    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Bedroom.
    It is pitch black at a quarter past six in the morning.  The phone 
    rings.  Frasier switches the light on revealing he is in bed.  He 
    answers the phone._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?
     **Carlos:**[_v.o_] Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** Yes, who's this? 
     **Carlos:** Dr. Kaufmann.  Bob Kaufmann of the National Psychotherapy 
             Institute.  Oh my gosh, it's six-fifteen in the morning 
             your time.  I hope I didn't wake you.
    **Frasier:** No, no, I was up. [_sits up_] Er, where did you say you were 
             calling from?
     **Carlos:** The National Psychotherapy Institute...
    _CUT TO: KACL
    
    We now see that it is not Dr. Kaufmann on the phone.  Frasier is 
    actually on the receiving end of a prank call from KACL's new morning 
    team, "Carlos And The Chicken."  Throughout this scene we swap between 
    KACL studios and Frasier's bedroom._
     **Carlos:**...in Saddle River, New Jersey.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, of course.  What can I do for you?
     **Carlos:** Oh, for Pete's sake.  No one called you?  You won our Radio 
             Therapist of the Year Award.  Congratulations.
    **Frasier:**[_takes it in_] Well, thank you.  Of course, the work itself is 
             honor enough.
     **Carlos:** Thank you!  And I'm sorry about the mix-up.  The problem is 
             we're going to need some pictures of you so we can get started 
             on the statue.
    **Frasier:** Statue?
     **Carlos:** For our Hall of Thinkers. [_aside_] Angie, he never got the 
             packet!
    **Frasier:** Is there anything I can do?
     **Carlos:** Well, it's a little late now, but maybe if you describe your 
             body we could get started on the preliminary carving.  The 
             sculptor's right here.  Fortunately we got Herr Gustav 
             Brumhalt. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, my.
    _The Chicken takes on the German accent of Gustav._
    **Chicken:** Dr. Crane, please, _ja_?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, this is Dr. Crane speaking.  Herr Brumhalt, may I 
             say, it's quite an honor.
    **Chicken:**_Ja, Ja, Ja._ We have your face, very handsome, but I need you 
             to describe your body.
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.  Er, six foot one, medium build, broad 
             shoulders, sublimely proportioned...
    **Chicken:**_Ja, das ist gut, Ja._ But before I order my marble I need to 
             describe your, how do I say this, where you sit?  _Ja_?
    **Frasier:** Oh, my posterior, yeah well, that's a little sensitive, isn't 
             it? [_laughs_]
    **Chicken:** Oh, you don't want to tell me, I understand, it's a big one. 
             Angie, order the big marble, please.
    **Frasier:** Please put Dr. Kaufmann back on.
    **Chicken:** No, I have a better idea.  Why don't you send us a picture of 
             your [_reverts to normal voice_] hindquarters and send it 
             into KACL's new morning team...
    **Chicken/Carlos:** Carlos And The Chicken!
    _Carlos laughs into the mike while the Chicken buck-bucks like a chicken._
    **Frasier:**[_takes it in_] Dr. Kaufmann?  Angie?
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier enters from his room that morning as Daphne does the same. 
    Frasier is fuming, Daphne is trying to contain her laughter._
    **Frasier:** Morning!
     **Daphne:**[_nearly laughing_] Good morning, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** You won't believe what just happened to me!  I was the victim 
             of a radio prank.
     **Daphne:** Oh, how terrible! [_swallows her laughter_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's a sad day when getting a man to describe his own 
             behind passes as humor. 
    _Daphne ducks into the kitchen, laughing uncontrollably._
    **Frasier:** You heard the whole thing, didn't you!
     **Daphne:**[_comes back with coffee_] _Ja!_ I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, 
             but they can be funny.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's all right, Daphne.  "Carlos and the Chicken" are 
             the sort of performers who keep popping up on the radio 
             these days.  So-called humorists who rely on cruel pranks and 
             scatological references.  Well, I suppose that's the sort of 
             thing that passes for entertainment these days.  You know, 
             perhaps it's just a generational thing.
    _Then Martin enters, walking cane in hand, laughing his socks off._
     **Martin:** Man, they got you good!  The Chicken was on fire!  What a 
             great bit!
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I think it will be bit of the day.
     **Martin:** Yeah!
    **Frasier:**[_gets up_] I'm going back to bed.
     **Martin:** Frasier, wait a minute, can you get me a tape of the show?
    **Frasier:** What on earth for?
     **Martin:** How often do you get to hear your son on the radio?!
    _Frasier stares._
    **Frasier:** I'm on the radio everyday!
    _He storms off to his room.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Three - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier orders his coffee at the counter and meets Roz at a table.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hello Roz, I suppose you heard about my unscheduled appearance 
             on KACL's new morning show.
        **Roz:** No, what happened?
    **Frasier:** Well, the less said about it, the better.
        **Roz:** Come on Frasier, why don't you pull up a couple of chairs 
             and tell me about it? [_laughs_]
    _Frasier sits._
     **Frasier:** Was everyone in Seattle listening at six in the morning?
         **Roz:** Did they do it at six?  I heard the replay at eight.
    **Waitress:**[_bringing Frasier's coffee_] I heard it at nine-fifteen.
         **Roz:** Congratulations, you were bit of the day!
     **Frasier:** Oh, I thought the entire thing was rude and childish.
         **Roz:** Well, you're just mad because you fell for it.  Come on, 
              Frasier, "Hall of Thinkers"?
     **Frasier:** Well, it's not such a bad idea.  In a society where we 
              glorify our athletes and rock musicians, I thought maybe 
              we should... [_then_] Well, it was early.
    _Meanwhile, Kenny, Carlos and the Chicken enter and sit down at the 
    opposite table.  Roz notices them._
        **Roz:** Hey, that's them over there with Kenny.  Wow!  The Chicken's 
             a lot cuter than he is on his billboard. Of course, he's not 
             squatting in a feather suit trying to hatch Carlos's head. 
    **Frasier:** Do you know, I think I might just go over there and introduce 
             myself.
        **Roz:** I don't know what you're thinking, but don't.
    **Frasier:** I'm just going to go over there and let them know that what 
             they did today was completely unacceptable. 
        **Roz:** Frasier, I know guys like this.  Once they know they can 
             rattle you, they never stop.  Just take your lumps and laugh 
             it off.
    **Frasier:** I'm perfectly capable of laughing it off, I just want to let 
             them know that I don't appreciate being made the punch line 
             at my own station.  I'm going to go over there and tell them 
             from now on, I don't want any part of their shenanigans.
        **Roz:** Oh God, _please_ don't say "shenanigans!"
    _Frasier goes over to the table._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Kenny.  I believe introductions are in order.
      **Kenny:** Oh, right, Dr. Frasier Crane, this is the Chicken and Carlos.
     **Carlos:** Ah, ah...
      **Kenny:** What?
     **Carlos:** We're actually called "Carlos and the Chicken."
    **Frasier:** Yes well, nice to meet you boys.  About this morning...
      **Kenny:** Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, I don't want to see any feathers flying 
             here. [_laughs_] Just kidding.
     **Carlos:** Dr. Crane, I hope we didn't go too far.  We love your show.
    **Frasier:** Really, you're listeners?
     **Carlos:** Oh yeah, we're big fans.  And you know, the last thing we want 
             to do is step on your toes. 
    **Frasier:** Well you know, you do tread a fine line with your style of 
             comedy, but perhaps you can be excused for stomping on it 
             rather exuberantly on your first day.  Just keep in mind in 
             the future that this station does have a certain pecking 
             order. [_laughs_] 
     **Carlos:** We totally get it, Dr. Crane, it felt wrong when we did it.
    **Chicken:** Sure did, sure you're not upset or anything?
    **Frasier:** Oh no, no harm, no foul. [_laughs_]
    **Chicken:** It's great meeting you, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Likewise, boys.  Hey, call me Frasier, but don't call me at 
             home.
     **Carlos:** And Dr. Crane: we're listening!
    _Frasier laughs, and goes back to Roz._
        **Roz:** Is it over?  I couldn't look.
    **Frasier:** For God's sake, Roz, have a little faith in me.  After all, 
             I do reason with people for a living.  It's all settled.  
             You know, they're good kids, really, quite sensible actually.
        **Roz:** Yeah, if you go for beer-belching frat boy types - which I do, 
             was the Chicken wearing a wedding ring?
    **Frasier:** You know, I really did overreact this morning.  After all, 
             it was kind of cute, I suppose. [_laughs_] "Hall of Thinkers." 
             Never let it be said that Frasier Crane is the kind of man 
             who is incapable of laughing at himself.
    _The waitress brings him two cakes._
    **Waitress:** These are for you. 
     **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Yes, I see, some patron has sent me some sticky 
              buns. [_to caf e_] Very funny.  Very funny, indeed.
    **Waitress:** You ordered those, sir.
     **Frasier:** Oh, so I did, thank you.
    _Frasier tucks in.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **TAKE THAT, ALFALFA**
    _Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin is on the phone to his friend.  Frasier is drinking coffee
    in his dressing gown.  Daphne is also hanging around.  The doorbell 
    sounds._
     **Martin:** No kidding.  He's flying you to Las Vegas for the fight? 
             [_so Frasier can hear_] That's a great son you've got there, 
             Duke.
    _Frasier gives him a look.  Daphne opens the door to Niles._
     **Daphne:** Good morning, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne, Dad.  Frasier, I thought you might like to 
             join me.  I'm going down to Abigail's to have my crepe pans 
             re-seasoned.
    _Martin quickly turns away the phone so Duke doesn't hear._
    **Frasier:** Gosh, I'd love to, Niles, but I've just drawn myself
             a nice herbal bath.
    _Martin turns the other way._
     **Martin:**[_laughs_] No, no, it's just Daphne, she's watching PBS.  Okay, 
             I'll talk to you later, Duke. [_hangs up_] Does the whole world 
             have to know what goes on in this house?
    **Frasier:** Help yourself to some coffee, Niles.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    _Frasier exits to the bathroom._
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, how do you know it's time to have your crepe pans 
             re-seasoned, anyway?
      **Niles:** It can be confusing.  But this may help: "Saucepans in summer, 
             crepe pans in fall, when winter's upon us, there's food for 
             us all."
    _The phone sounds._
     **Martin:** Whoever it is, I am not home, I am not here!
    _Niles answers the phone._
      **Niles:** Hello.
    **Chicken:**[_v.o with accent_] Is Dr. Crane there?
      **Niles:** No, actually he's taking a bath.
    **Chicken:** Who's this?
      **Niles:** This is his brother, Niles.
    **Chicken:** Okay, well this is the building superintendent.  
    _CUT TO: KACL.
    Carlos and the Chicken are on the air, and Chicken is navigating their
    latest crank call._
    **Chicken:** I'm in the bathroom just below his and I think the pipes are 
             getting corroded.  Is your brother putting anything unusual 
             in his bath?
    _Back to the Apartment._
      **Niles:** I'm not exactly sure what he puts in his bath.  Better let 
             me ask him.
    _Niles exits with the phone._
     **Martin:** I smell a bit.
     **Daphne:** Put the radio on.
    _Martin does. 
    
    CUT TO: Frasier's Bathroom.
    Meanwhile, Frasier is enjoying his bath whilst singing "I'm in the 
    Mood for Love."  Niles enters._
    **Frasier:** I'm in the mood for love...
      **Niles:** Frasier-
    **Frasier:** Simply because you're near me...  
      **Niles:** Frasier, what do you put in your bath water?
    **Frasier:** You know very well it's a proprietary blend, Niles.
      **Niles:** No, no, no, it's your super.  There's something corroding the 
             pipes in the unit below you, he thinks it may be something in 
             your tub. [_hands him the phone_]
    **Frasier:**[_to phone_] Hello, yes, I'm sure it's not my fault but if 
             you insist, I use... [_waits for Niles to exit_] ...jasmine, 
             lavender, rose hips and a little Tahitian Vanilla. 
    **Chicken:** Yeah well, it sounds okay.  Boy, with a bath like that I bet 
             the ladies sure go for you though, huh? 
    **Frasier:** Yes well, love does enter through the nose.
    **Chicken:** Hey you know, the neighbors down here have been complaining 
             about a little sound bleed-through.  I think we got a bad 
             tile, I sure would like to check it.  I heard you sing into 
             the phone earlier.  You think you could, I don't know, do it 
             again?
    **Frasier:** All right.
    _Frasier begins singing "I'm in the Mood for Love" again.
    CUT TO: KACL._
    **Chicken:** Yeah, that's great.  I definitely heard some bleed-through. 
             You know, I could isolate the tile if you could just walk 
             around a little bit... [_Carlos bounces in his chair_] or maybe 
             you know, if you could stomp around that would be great.
    **Frasier:** Stomp around?
    **Chicken:** Yeah, well look, if it's too much trouble I could send my 
             assistant, Jimmy, up to stomp around.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, please.  You just leave Jimmy where he is.  
             I certainly don't need an audience while I'm singing in 
             the bathtub.
    **Chicken:** I really appreciate this.  We'll get it all cleared up in a 
             jiffy.  Thanks a lot, Dr. Crane.
    _Back to the bathroom:_
    **Frasier:** Just wait a second and I'll tell you when I'm ready.
    _Frasier gets out of the bath and puts his robe on._
    **Frasier:** I'm ready.  Here goes.
    _Frasier, whilst singing his song, jumps around the bathroom producing 
    a farce._
    **Frasier:** I'm in the mood for love, [_stomps his foot_]
             Simply because you're near me, [_starts jumping around_]
             Funny but...
    _CUT TO: we see a shot of Roz listening to this in her car._
    **Frasier:**[_on radio_] When you're near meeeeee....
    _She sinks her head down onto the steering wheel.
    
    CUT BACK TO: the bathroom._
    **Frasier:** I'm in the mood for love...
    **Chicken:** Oh my God!  The whole ceiling's falling down.  Ow!
    **Frasier:** Oh, good Lord! [_retreats and sits on edge of tub_]
    _Niles runs in, shaking his head._
    **Frasier:** Niles, be careful, the whole ceiling's caving in.
    **Chicken:** Hey listen, I think we found out what the problem is: it's 
             that _humongous_ ass of yours!
     **Carlos:** Listeners, "Carlos and the Chicken" are offering one thousand 
             dollars for the best picture of Frasier Crane's humongous ass 
             for our website.
    _Then they start playing a theme song that goes "Frasier Crane's 
    humongous ass contest."  Niles looks on to an appalled and 
    despairing Frasier._
    **Frasier:**[_hangs up_] Oh, dear God!
      **Niles:** Now, now, it won't get you down for long.  You've always had 
             a thick skin. [_starts to giggle_] Unless that Tahitian Vanilla 
             softened you up a bit...
    **Frasier:** GET OUT!
    _Niles runs out.
    
    End of Act One. 
    
    Act Two._
    
    **THE UMBRELLA POLICY**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    It is another morning in the Crane household.  Martin is sat in his 
    chair, wearing his dressing gown and reading his paper.  Frasier 
    bursts in with a sweater tied around his waist to cover his backside.  
    As he enters, we can see camera flashes outside.  Frasier is 
    carrying a medicine bottle._
    **Frasier:**[_enters_] Leave me alone!  For God's sake, have some respect.
     **Martin:** Was that Mrs. Kurdsmen?
    **Frasier:** She dropped her medication in the hallway.  As I stooped to 
             pick it up, out came her camera like an assassin's blade. 
             Well, if she wants to control those blood clots, she'll 
             cough up that film! [_puts the pills on the cabinet_] 
     **Martin:** You're really getting riled up.
    **Frasier:** I certainly am.
     **Martin:** Come on, they're just pranks.  Back in the force, we used to 
             do stuff like this all the time.  We'd fill a guy's hat with 
             shaving cream or nail his shoes to the floor.  Sometimes 
             we'd get a guy dead drunk and leave him in a drawer in the 
             morgue! [_laughs_] 
    _The doorbell sounds.  Frasier crosses to the door._
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, I might have been able to laugh it off if all 
             of Seattle hadn't started stalking me with cameras! 
    _Frasier looks through the spy-hole in the door.  He then quickly opens 
    the door and pulls a surprised Niles inside._
    **Frasier:** Quickly Niles, inside, come on! [_slams the door_]
      **Niles:** Why didn't you hold the elevator?  Didn't you hear me 
             shouting?
    **Frasier:** That was you?  I'm sorry, Niles, I was afraid you were trying 
             to get a picture of my butt!
      **Niles:** How exciting to be present at the birth of a new phobia. 
             [_gives Frasier a look_]
    **Frasier:** I'm talking about Carlos and the Chicken.
      **Niles:** Oh, yes, their little contest.  I can't believe anyone's 
             taking that seriously.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, they won't be for much longer.  I've decided it's 
             time to fight back.  I was up to all hours last night crafting 
             my response to those two idiots.  I believe I have arrived at 
             a masterful rebuttal.
     **Martin:** I'm not sure you want to call it your reBUTTal.
    _Frasier and Niles cross to the table where quotations books are laid 
    across the table along with Frasier's speech._
      **Niles:** I see your "Bartlett's" is out.  You're not pulling any 
             punches!
    **Frasier:** Hardly.  I go in swinging with La Rochefoucauld: "If we had no 
             faults of our own, we would not take so much pleasure in 
             noticing those of others." 
      **Niles:**[_boxing-match style_] Ouch!
    **Frasier:** And when I've knocked them reeling, I go in with a jab of 
             Dorothy Parker: "Wit has truth in it, wise-cracking is 
             merely calisthenics with words."
      **Niles:** Pow!
    **Frasier:** And when they're bloody and against the ropes, I go in with 
             the kill - [_shadow-boxing_] Twain, Wilde, Twain, Twain, 
             Mencken!
      **Niles:** It's not a fight, it's an execution!
    _As they laugh and caper enthusiastically, Martin comes over to the 
    table._
     **Martin:** You know Frasier, if you go and read that on the air you're 
             going to set yourself up for a year of abuse.  You know, this 
             kind of thing is probably the reason why these guys started 
             picking on you in the first place. 
    **Frasier:** All right, Dad, what exactly are you saying?  That I somehow 
             managed to bring all this misery on myself?
     **Martin:** No, I'm not saying that, just... well, have you ever wondered 
             why these bullies have always kind of zeroed in on you two?
      **Niles:** No, we don't wonder why, we know the reason:
    **Frasier/Niles:** Jealousy!
     **Martin:** Okay, so there's a little bit of that too.  But you know, you 
             kinda give people the impression that you're... above them.
    **Frasier:** Pish-tosh!
      **Niles:** Poppycock!
    _Daphne enters in her gown._
      **Niles:** Morning, Daphne.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne, do you think we're snobby, superior and 
             condescending?
     **Daphne:** That's it!  I'm getting my door sound-proofed.
    _She goes to the kitchen._
     **Martin:** See what I mean?  People think you're stuffy.  You know, with 
             your opera parties, and your wine parties, and your seasoned 
             crepe pans.
    **Frasier:** In my defense, Niles is the only one who has ever seasoned his 
             crepe pans.
      **Niles:** Which is the precisely why I've had the same set since the 
             ninth grade, thank you very much.
     **Martin:** My point is, you guys could never resist putting on airs. 
             Even when you were in junior high, you used to love that 
             TV  program, "The Avengers."  You used to run all over the 
             neighborhood pretending you were that guy with the umbrella... 
             Steve.
    **Frasier:** Steed!
      **Niles:**[_rolls his eyes_] Dad!
    **Frasier:** There were worse role models.  Steed was dapper and witty. 
             When anyone tried to give him grief, he gave them a sound 
             thrashing with the umbrella. 
     **Martin:** Well, that's great, admire him if you want.  But did you have 
             to run through the neighborhood in bowler hats?  I mean, 
             you were just begging to get beat up.
    **Frasier:** Come to think of it, it was rather a rough summer that year, 
             wasn't it?
      **Niles:** I remember getting a chin strap so the bowler wouldn't fall 
             off when I ran.
     **Martin:** And all that did was make you look like Elizabeth Taylor in 
             "National Velvet."  My point is, if you go down to the station 
             and read that over the air, then you might as well go down 
             there in a great big bowler hat.  I mean, people are never 
             going to let you forget it.
    _"[The bowler] should never be worn abroad, never by foreigners, and 
    Americans who attempt to do so should be fined." 
    -- Hardy Amies, designer
    
    Daphne has re-entered with coffee._
     **Daphne:** You know, it's funny hearing you talk about "The Avengers." 
             My first Halloween in America, I went to a party dressed as 
             Mrs. Peel.  Head-to-toe in that skintight black leather 
             catsuit. [_Niles looks up_] Come to think of it, I still have 
             it somewhere, and Halloween's coming up.
     **Martin:** Catsuit, huh? [_referring to Eddie who has just come in_] 
             Better not let this guy hear you talking about that, he'll 
             go nuts.
      **Niles:** I would not! [_sees Eddie_] ...be surprised if he did!  
             Ho-ho-ho. [_strokes Eddie_]
    _The phone rings._
    **Frasier:** Excuse me. [_answers_] Hello?  Why, Roz - yes, just calm down. 
             No, no, I'm not listening.  Hang on a second.
    _Frasier turns on the radio.  "Carlos and the Chicken" have put together 
    a tape which sounds like Roz and Frasier having sex - voice clips from 
    the radio show laid over background sounds of moaning and grunting.  
    Frasier is horrified._
    **Frasier:**[_on radio_] Roz!  Oh, dear God!
     **Carlos:**[_on radio_] I think we're going to have to throw a bucket of 
             water on those two.
    **Chicken:**[_on radio_] Roz and Frasier stopped around for a quick hello, 
             next thing you know, they're getting it on in the booth!
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:**[_on radio_] Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Do we have time to squeeze in one more?
        **Roz:** Plenty of time, Frasier.  Two more minutes.
     **Carlos:** You know, for a man carrying around a good fifty extra pounds 
             of ass, Frasier Crane has got unbelievable stamina.  Frasier, 
             where do you get your energy?
    **Frasier:** Lavender, rose hips and a little Tahitian Vanilla.
     **Carlos:** Oh my God, they're changing positions.  I've never seen 
             that one before.
    **Frasier:** Love does enter through the nose.
    _Frasier turns it off.  Martin, Daphne and Niles can't contain their 
    laughter._
    **Frasier:** Call you back, Roz. [_hangs up_] I'm going down there.
     **Martin:** Frasier...
    **Frasier:** Dad, don't try to talk me out of this, I'm going to teach 
             those two a lesson, they'll not soon forget. [_grabs speech_] 
             Where's my umbrella?
     **Martin:** Oh no, not that again!  Not the umbrella, I'm begging you!
    **Frasier:** It's raining!
    _Frasier grabs his umbrella and exits the apartment to an array of 
    camera flashes._
    **Frasier:** No!  No, stop it!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - KACL Radio Station.
    Frasier storms through the double doors into the corridor outside the 
    studio where "Carlos and the Chicken" are live on air.  Frasier bumps 
    into an equally angry Roz._
    **Frasier:** Roz, what are you doing here?
        **Roz:** I am getting revenge, that's what!  These guys are going down!  
             Did you hear the disgusting, vile things they said about me?
    **Frasier:** Just the part about us having sex.
        **Roz:** Exactly!  And now they've got a photo contest about me now, 
             too.
    **Frasier:** Roz, a thousand dollars for a shot of your behind?  Sorry.
        **Roz:** No, it's fifty bucks and a six-pack.  And there were seven 
             winners before I even left the house.  Frasier, what shall 
             we do?  Slash their tires, should we crack their windshields?
    **Frasier:** No, I was thinking of a more direct approach, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, I'm down with that too!  Next commercial, I'll get the 
             Chicken, you take the big guy.
    **Frasier:** No, no, that's not it and you know it, Roz.
        **Roz:** I knew you'd say that.  Fine, I'll take the big guy.
    **Frasier:** No, no, Roz.  Listen to yourself, you're lusting for blood 
             like a barbarian.  I've a more civilized approach in mind.  
             I have composed a speech!
    _Roz stares at him._
        **Roz:** A speech?  Well, unless you plan to roll it up and cram it 
             down their throats, what good is that gonna do?
    **Frasier:** Just watch me.
        **Roz:** No, Frasier, they're never going to stop making fun of you.
    **Frasier:** Roz, I don't care.  I just figured out something, you know, 
             maybe you can't stop bullies from attacking you, but the 
             only way they win is if they change who you are, and I'll 
             tell you something, let them do their worst.  They will not 
             knock the bowler off of this head!
    _He goes into the booth, leaving Roz totally bewildered._
        **Roz:**[_opens the door_] What does that mean?!
    _Frasier enters the booth and shuts Roz outside.  Carlos and the 
    Chicken react to him._
     **Carlos:** Holy Cow, look who just walked into the booth: Frasier Crane, 
             the automatic sex pilot.
    **Chicken:** What's up, love doctor?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think you two know what's up.  There's only so much I
             can take, there's only so much anyone can take from a 
             juvenile comic and his straight man.  I believe it was La 
             Rochefoucauld who first said...
    **Chicken:** Listen to me, I'll take my straight man over your sex-
             starved producer any day, my friend.
        **Roz:**[_bursts in_] Nobody...
    _Frasier locks her out again._
     **Carlos:** Hey, wait a second, I'm not your straight man.  If anything, 
             I'm the funny one.
    **Chicken:** Let's not start with this again, okay?
     **Carlos:** You're the one who just started it, on the air!
    **Frasier:** It was La Rochefoucauld that first said...
     **Carlos:** You always do this.
    **Chicken:** Hey Carlos, the therapist said not to use the word "always."
     **Carlos:** I just wish you could say I was as funny as you are. 
    **Chicken:** Now, I wish I could say that too, but who does all the funny 
             voices?
    **Frasier:** La Rochefoucauld once said-
     **Carlos:** If I'm so unfunny, how come I get all the solo gigs?
    **Chicken:** Oh, now I'm laughing, ha-ha!
     **Carlos:** Don't believe me?  Ask our agent!
    **Chicken:** You talked to Zachary behind my back.
    **Frasier:** You know, if I could just get a word in...
     **Carlos:** I'm going.
    **Chicken:** Go ahead, be my guest.
     **Carlos:** Great, because I don't need you and I don't need "Carlos and 
             the Chicken." 
    **Chicken:** Oh, really?  Well, best of luck, funny boy!
     **Carlos:** Same to you, Dwayne! [_exits_]
    **Chicken:** Hey, that's not cool.
    **Frasier:** Chicken!  I believe it was La Rochefoucauld, the great French 
             thinker...
    **Chicken:** Hey, give it a rest, double-wide, I went to grad school too.  
             And P.S.: It's pronounced [_different_] "La Rochefoucald."
    **Frasier:**[_livid_] That's it!  Nobody corrects my French pronunciation, 
             you son of a...!
    _Frasier runs Chicken off the premises as Kenny enters._
      **Kenny:**[_calls after_] Chicken! [_to Frasier_] Did you have to be so 
             vicious?
    **Frasier:** Me?!
      **Kenny:** We got dead air, take over! [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, right. [_sits at microphone_] This is Dr. Frasier Crane, 
             I'll be filling in for the next hour of the morning zoo with 
             my own particular brand of zany antics. [_thinks, then_] 
             Let's see, em, you know there was a fabulous cartoon in the 
             recent "New Yorker". Let me see if I can describe it for 
             you...

    The doorbell sounds, Frasier answers it to Mrs. Kurdsmen, the old

    medication.  She hands over the film and Frasier hands over the pill 
    bottle.  However, once again she "accidentally" drops it on the floor. 
    As Frasier bends to pick it up, she gets her camera out once more. 
    Frasier takes the pills, throws them across the apartment and shuts

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    **ACT ONE**
    
    _SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S BEDROOM - PITCH BLACK_
    
    The phone rings.  Frasier snaps on the bedside lamp, gropes for the 
    phone and answers groggily.  It's Dr. Kaufman from the National 
    Psychotherapy Institute, calling to tell Frasier that he's won an 
    award as Radio Therapist of the Year.  As Frasier fumbles for an 
    appropriate expression of gratitude, we see KACL's new morning radio 
    team, Carlos and the Chicken, in the studio as they continue their 
    prank call.  These guys are good, and Frasier is completely taken in.
    
    "Dr. Kaufman" tells Frasier that they need to get started on his 
    commemorative statute for their Hall of Thinkers, and asks him to 
    describe his body for the sculptor who is on the phone with them at 
    that very moment.  Frasier complies, matter-of-factly at first, then 
    starting to get carried away as he describes his height, build, broad 
    shoulders, sublime proportions�  The "sculptor" tells Frasier that he 
    needs a description of his posterior to order the correct size block 
    of marble.  Frasier hesitates, and the sculptor breaks character to 
    suggest that instead Frasier send a photo of his obviously large rear 
    to the new KACL morning team, Carlos and the Chicken.  Frasier is 
    stunned.
    
    _SCENE TWO - FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER_
    
    Frasier comes out of the bedroom tying his robe and looking for 
    sympathy from Daphne, who's heard the whole routine on the radio and 
    can't keep a straight face.  Frasier's hopeful theory that such low 
    humor must be a generational aberration is dashed when Martin enters, 
    crowing over Frasier's humiliation.  To Frasier's vast irritation, 
    Martin even expresses interest in getting a tape of the show.
    
    _SCENE THREE - CAF� NERVOSA - LATER THAT DAY_
    
    Roz is listening to Frasier's tale of woe with pretended sympathy, 
    but soon starts berating him for falling for such an obvious bit.  
    She notices Carlos and the Chicken enter the cafe with the station 
    manager, and Frasier steels himself to confront the pranksters.  Roz 
    tries to explain that confronting them will only make things worse, 
    but Frasier won't be dissuaded.  He introduces himself to the pair, 
    who apologize eloquently for their extreme behavior on their first 
    day at KACL.  Frasier is mollified and crows to Roz about his ability 
    to laugh at himself.
    
    _SCENE FOUR - FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING_
    
    Martin is on the phone with Duke and Frasier is at breakfast as Niles 
    rings the doorbell.  He invites Frasier to join him at a local 
    culinary shop where Niles is having his crepe pans reseasoned, but 
    Frasier declines.  He's just drawn himself an herbal bath, and he 
    exits to the bathroom as Niles pours himself a cup of coffee.  He's 
    just about to sit down with Martin and Daphne when the phone rings.  
    Niles answers, and it's the building superintendent in the apartment 
    below Frasier's.  The pipes in that bathroom are corroding, and the 
    superintendent wants to know if Frasier is putting anything unusual 
    in his bathwater.  Niles dutifully trots off to the bathroom to ask 
    Frasier, but Martin and Daphne smell a rat -- or a Chicken -- and 
    gleefully turn on the radio.
    
    _FRASIER'S BATHROOM_
    
    Niles explains the situation to Frasier, who is in the bath singing 
    "I'm In The Mood For Love."  Impatiently Frasier takes the phone and 
    describes the fancy blend he's using for the bath.  As Martin and 
    Daphne suspected, Carlos and the Chicken are in the studio having a 
    great time at Frasier's expense.  They manage to talk him into 
    continuing to sing as he hops and stamps heavily around the bathroom 
    in his robe, helping them to check for loose tiles in the floor.  The 
    radio team breaks up laughing and offers listeners $1,000 for the 
    best picture of Frasier Crane's "humongous ass" for their website.  
    Once again Frasier is stunned to realize he's been had -- and how.
    
    
    **ACT TWO**
    
    _SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING_
    
    Frasier rushes in from the elevator lobby amid a storm of camera 
    flashes.  He's wearing a sweater tied around his hips in self-defense 
    as one of his neighbors tries to get a picture of his posterior for 
    the radio team.  Niles arrives almost immediately and applauds when 
    Frasier tells him of the carefully crafted speech he's written as a 
    rebuttal to the radio team's practical jokes.  Getting into the 
    spirit, Frasier warms to his argument by quoting Mark Twain, Oscar 
    Wilde, Dorothy Parker and H.L. Mencken in lightning succession as 
    Niles cheers him ethusiastically.  Martin warns him against 
    confronting the bullies, and tries to explain to the brothers that 
    they've always made themselves targets by talking down to other 
    people.  As usual, the boys just don't get it.
    
    Just then phone rings and it's Roz, nearly hysterical.  Frasier turns 
    on the radio in time to hear Carlos and the Chicken's newest routine 
    -- a patched-together tape that sounds like Frasier and Roz having 
    sex in the control booth.  Frasier has had enough, and leaves for the 
    station to have it out with the two new DJ's.
    
    _SCENE TWO -KACL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE STUDIO_
    
    Roz is eager to draw blood as Frasier storms in, armed with speech.  
    She's ready to do the new team serious bodily harm, but Frasier 
    pushes her aside and enters the studio for a serious confrontation.
    
    _THE STUDIO_
    
    Frasier grabs a microphone and launches into his speech as the team 
    looks on in amusement.  Roz tries to shove her way into the booth to 
    get in on the action, but Frasier pushes her out again.  His tirade 
    starts to build momentum as he reviles the two as "a juvenile comic 
    and his straight man."  The DJ's are amused at first, but after a 
    moment Frasier's remarks open old wounds as the hosts begin to bicker 
    over long-standing differences.  Finally Carlos invites the Chicken 
    to do the show himself, and leaves.  Frasier is still trying to make 
    his speech, and the Chicken (who's points out he's been to grad 
    school himself) corrects Frasier's pronunciation of a French author's 
    name.  That's the last straw, and he rushes out of the studio pursued 
    by an enraged Frasier.
    
    _FADE OUT_
