    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Hallway Outside Frasier's Apartment
    FADE IN:
    Roz is standing at the door to Frasier's apartment when the elevator 
    opens and Frasier, Daphne, Niles and Mel get off.  All four are dressed 
    in black.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, there you are.  I brought something for Daphne and I was 
             just gonna leave it with the doorman. [_Daphne begins to cry_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, lord. 
    _Reset to: Living Room
    They go in.  Daphne heads into the powder room._
        **Roz:** Did I say something?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually our doorman, Morrie, passed away this week.  
             We just got back from the funeral.
        **Roz:** Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.  Is she going to be all right?
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, she's been a little high-strung all week, even 
             before he died.  I guess it's just wedding stuff, you know.
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    _Daphne comes back._
     **Daphne:** Ooh, sorry 'bout that.  So, you brought me something, Roz?
        **Roz:** Well, yeah.  I figured you couldn't get married without 
             wearing something borrowed. [_Hands her a small box_]
     **Daphne:** Oh!  What a beautiful garter!  Look at all the lovely detail.
      **Niles:** I especially like the little odometer. 
    _Roz backhands him in the stomach as he grins._
     **Daphne:** Thank you so much, Roz.
        **Mel:** Does anybody besides me feel like a cup of coffee?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'll brew a pot.
        **Mel:** Oh, don't be silly. I've been here enough times to know how 
             to get the coffee made.  Daphne, make us some coffee. [_Then_] 
             Kidding!  
    _Niles laughs.  She heads for the kitchen._
        **Roz:**[_picking up a folder_] The Wayside Inn.  This is where you're 
             having your wedding?  Oh gosh, it's just so beautiful.
     **Daphne:** I hope it is, the planning's been a nightmare.  I spent an 
             hour today on the seating charts.  Everyone has some demand.  
             "Don't sit me near the band", "Do you mind if I bring a 
             friend?"...
        **Roz:** Oh my God, you can't seat me next to him.
     **Daphne:** Exactly!  Every selfish, whiny little thing...
        **Roz:** No, you cannot seat me next to Tim Walsh.  I dated him all 
             last summer and he dumped me.
     **Daphne:** He's going with my bridesmaid Annie.  I have to seat the 
             bridesmaids together.
        **Roz:** This always happens to me.  Is there no place I can go without 
             running into some guy I've dated?
      **Niles:** I was reading about a Trappist monastery in the Amazon that 
             they somehow built into the treetop.
        **Roz:** Shut up, ya big doily!  This is gonna be awful!  Here I am 
             at a wedding, sitting next to a guy who dumped me!
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on Roz, you won't be alone.  You'll be on the arm 
             of a well-known Seattle boulevardier and radio star.
        **Roz:** Frasier, I can't go with you.  I mean, going to a wedding 
             with your boss is like going to the prom with your brother.
    **Frasier:** Niles and I did not go to the prom together!  Our dates were 
             sick and we went stag!
      **Niles:** In retrospect, yes, we should have canceled the horse-drawn 
             carriage, but hindsight is 20/20.
    _FADE OUT_
    **MEMENTO MORRIE**
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Living Room
    FADE IN:
    Martin enters carrying a gift bag._
     **Martin:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hi, Martin.  I'm really sorry to hear about your friend Morrie.
     **Martin:** Oh, thanks.  Yeah, his wife just did the nicest thing.  
             I guess she knew Eddie and I'd stop by and shoot the 
             breeze with him, so she gave us something to remember 
             him by.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well. [_Reading the tag_] "For Martin and Eddie."  
             Gee, isn't that nice?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I think it's some kinda wine.
    **Frasier:** Well, yes I'd say so, but... 
    
    _He pulls out the bottle, reads the label, and gasps._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, Dad!  This is a 1945 Chateau Petrus!
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah?  She said he got it from his uncle who was in France 
             after the war.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's one of the rarest bottles in the world! 
     **Martin:** Well, if you're good, maybe Eddie'll give you a glass out 
             of his half.
    _Martin exits to the kitchen as Niles comes over to examine the bottle._
      **Niles:** I've never even seen a '45 Petrus!
        **Roz:** Oh, poor Morrie.  He probably waited his whole life for an 
             occasion special enough to open that bottle.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Perhaps this should be a lesson for us all.  Morrie 
             might be standing guard at the door to heaven right now, 
             but he's buzzing us with one last message: Live life now.  
             I'm reminded of a parable... 
    _Knock on the door._
    
    **Daphne/Niles/Roz:** Come in!
    _The door opens and Simon (Daphne's obnoxious brother) enters with a 
    duffel bag._
    
     **Daphne:** Simon!
      **Simon:** Hello, sis.
     **Daphne:** I thought you were in California.
      **Simon:** Yeah, well, those friends I went to surprise were out of town.  
             So I decided to housesit for 'em, which was lovely.  'Til they 
             came home last night.  I don't know what all the screaming was 
             about, I was the one in the tub!   Where should I put this bag?
    **Frasier:** By the door so you don't forget it when you leave.
      **Simon:** Right.  I think I know everyone here. [_spots Roz_] Or do I?  
             And what would your name be then, Miss?
        **Roz:** Simon, you low-life idiot!  You made a date with me last week 
             and you stood me up!
    _She crosses toward the door._
      **Simon:** Sorry, love, I need a bit more to go on.
        **Roz:** Maybe this'll refresh your memory. 
    _She slams the door in his face._
      **Simon:** Roz!  Of course!
     **Martin:**[_entering from kitchen_] Well, look who's back!
      **Simon:** Well, who's this then?  I'd say it was Marty Crane, but 
             he's a bit too young and trim, eh?
     **Martin:** Oh, go on! Can I offer you a beer?
      **Simon:** Oh, I hate to drink alone, could I have a sandwich with that?
    _Martin and Simon exit to the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** If that beer-swilling boomerang thinks he's staying here, 
             he's got another thing coming.
      **Niles:** Better get a move on, he's already got your address on his 
             duffel bag.
    _The phone rings, Daphne gets it and goes to her room.  Mel enters from 
    the kitchen with a cup of coffee._
        **Mel:** We'd better get going if we're going to reach the cabin by 
             dark.
    **Frasier:** Cabin?
      **Niles:** Yes, Mel and I are celebrating our six-month anniversary by 
             taking a little mid-week getaway to her friend's country place.
        **Mel:** Yes, no phones, no stress, just two days of rest and 
             relaxation.  I do have to pick up a little anniversary 
             gift, though, so give me nine minutes and pick me up at 
             the northwest corner of Pike and Elm at 4:42.
    _Mel and Niles refer to their watches._
        **Mel:** Coming up on 4:33...
      **Niles:** Synchronizing...
        **Mel:** Now! [_Then_] Good, I'm relaxing already. 
    _She kisses Niles and leaves.  Martin and Simon enter from the kitchen._
      **Simon:** Thank you Marty, it's most hospitable of you.
     **Martin:** Well, you gotta have a place to stay...
    **Frasier:** Stop right there!  He cannot stay here!  The man is loud, 
             ill-mannered, and the last time he stayed here he killed 
             a ficus tree on the downstairs neighbor's balcony by means 
             which are best left to the imagination!
     **Martin:** Frasier, I invited Simon to stay in my Winnebago!  Come on 
             Simon, I'll show you your new digs.
    **Frasier:** Oh, lord.  Simon, you know I...
      **Simon:** Oh, no, forget about it.  It's no worse than what I was 
             just sayin' about you in the kitchen.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckles_] Good one.
      **Simon:**[_sotto to Martin_] He thinks I'm joking.  
    _Simon and Martin leave._
      **Niles:** Join me in a sherry, Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think I will, Niles.
      **Niles:** You know, I have to admit, I'm a little bit nervous about
             this trip.  I have a feeling Mel may make another push for 
             us to live together.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my.
      **Niles:** She's been bringing it up quite a bit lately.  She says 
             it's a good way for us to test our relationship.
    **Frasier:** You're afraid you'll discover things about each other that 
             you won't like?
      **Niles:** Oh, no.  No, no.  We're past that stage.  She knows my 
             likes and dislikes. I've come attuned to her various 
             quirks... eccentricities... bugaboos.... b�te noirs...
             night terrors.  It's the fun of being in love.  I don't 
             know what's bothering me.
    **Frasier:** Is it possible that your foot-dragging might have anything 
             to do with some lingering feelings for Daphne?
      **Niles:** Frasier, uh, you must realize I put that behind me months 
             ago.
    **Frasier:** Just asking.
      **Niles:** I'm very happy with Mel.
    **Frasier:** Well then, what's your problem?
      **Niles:** Uh, well, let's see.   I just got through with a rough 
             divorce.  I do have a tendency to be overly cautious...
    **Frasier:** This could be a chance to change all that.
      **Niles:** So you're in favor of it?
    **Frasier:** Well, I've never really been the president of the Mel fan 
             club, but she does seem to make you happy.  And as we were 
             reminded this morning, life is not to be taken in baby steps.  
             Ask not for whom the doorman buzzes...
      **Niles:** Thank you.  All right.  That was much-needed therapy. 
    _He gets up to leave._
    **Frasier:** Well, it was my pleasure.  You're my brother, you get the 
             family rate.
    _Martin comes in as Niles gets to the door._
     **Martin:** Hey, guys.  Got all the way down to the Winnebago and realized 
             I had the wrong keys.
      **Niles:** See you guys in a couple of days.
     **Martin:** All right.
    _Niles leaves, Daphne enters from her room on the phone._
     **Daphne:** You don't say, mum.  Your phlebitis again? 
    _She looks pleadingly at Frasier and holds the phone out._
    **Frasier:**[_bellowing_] Daphne!
     **Daphne:** Got to go now, mum, Dr. Crane's on the warpath again.  Bye. 
             [_Hangs up, then to Frasier_] Thank you!
     **Martin:** Daph, I'm glad you're here, because I was thinking about that 
             wine of Morrie's.  You know, that's something really for a 
             special occasion.  So, I'd like you to have for the wedding, 
             enjoy it on your honeymoon.
     **Daphne:**[_starting to cry_] Oh, Mr. Crane!  
    _She hugs him and cries on his shoulder._
     **Martin:** Oh, Daphne, come on.  Come on now, it's only a bottle of wine.  
             I don't even know that much about it.  Frasier?  Help me out 
             here, will you?
    **Frasier:** Well Dad, Chateau Petrus is a premier crux Bordeaux...
     **Martin:** No, no, no.  No, I mean with Daphne. 
    _Frasier comes over and holds Daphne._
     **Martin:** There you go.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne.  
    _Martin leaves._
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry to get so emotional like this.
    **Frasier:** It's all right.  The funeral must've really upset you.
     **Daphne:** It's not that.  Dr. Crane?  I've wanted to talk to you 
             about this all week, but I haven't known what to say.  
             You promise you'll keep this just between us?
    **Frasier:** Of course.
     **Daphne:** It's about your brother.  You see, I know.
    **Frasier:** Know what?
     **Daphne:** I know about his feelings for me.
    **Frasier:** My God!  How did you find out?
     **Daphne:** It's not important.
    **Frasier:** Somebody blabbed, didn't they?  Why can't people just mind 
             their own business?  Who was the nattering gossip?  Roz?  
             Dad?
     **Daphne:** You.
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Daphne:** You were taking those pills for your back and you blurted 
             it out while I was giving you a massage.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, they were very strong pills, you see...
     **Daphne:** Needless to say, it completely took my breath away.  At first, 
             I tried to forget about it, put it out of my mind.
    **Frasier:** Well, the bottle said just to take one, but I'm a big man...
     **Daphne:** Oh, will you shut up about those pills?! 
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
     **Daphne:** Anyway, after a while, I couldn't put it out of my mind 
             anymore.  I find myself thinking about him all the time.
    **Frasier:** Daphne... are you saying that you have feelings for Niles? 
     **Daphne:** I think I do.  Oh, I don't know!  Even if I did, he may not 
             feel that way about me anymore, he's with Mel now!
    **Frasier:** I-I don't know what to tell you, Daph.  Uh, I, I, think the 
             best thing is for you to, to try to find a way to talk with 
             Niles.
     **Daphne:** Ugh.  That's not an easy conversation to have.
    **Frasier:** It's easier now than after you're married.
     **Daphne:** You're right, I have to talk to him.  And right away.  I'm 
             already making myself sick over this.  If I leave it any 
             longer, I'll be a complete basket case.  Uh, did he mention 
             if he was going home?
    **Frasier:** Well, ah, actually, um, ah, he's going, ah, somewhere else 
             first.  Um...
     **Daphne:** Where?
    _CUT TO: the hallway.  
    Martin and Simon are getting off the elevator._
     **Martin:** Get you some towels and you'll be all set down there.
      **Simon:** Right.
    _They enter the apartment, Daphne is again sobbing on Frasier's 
    shoulder._
     **Martin:** Oh, geez, Daphne!  It's just a bottle of wine!
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    **ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FATTER**
    _Scene One - Frasier's Living Room.
    The doorbell rings._
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] I'll get it!
    _FADE IN: 
    Daphne is in the apartment, eating cookies from a large bag.  
    She puts the bag down, composes herself... and opens the door 
    to reveal Frasier holding a lot of packages._
     **Daphne:** Oh.  Dr. Crane!  I didn't even know you'd gone out.  
             I thought you might be your brother.
    **Frasier:** Well, I went down to get the mail and got all these wedding 
             gifts for you.  But don't worry, Niles called and said he'd
             be coming by this afternoon.
     **Daphne:**[_picking up the bag and eating another cookie_] I don't even 
             know how I'm going to begin this conversation.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure those chocolate-chip blackened teeth'll be a 
             nice icebreaker.
     **Daphne:** I've been so nervous lately, I've done nothing but stuff 
             myself with junk food.  
    _Frasier takes the bag and the doorbell rings._
     **Daphne:** Oh, it's him!
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, fine.  You're gonna be just fine.  
             Okay?  Remember to speak from the heart.
    _She goes to the door, composes herself... and opens the door to Martin._
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane!
     **Martin:** Thanks!  Eddie started doing his "I don't know how much 
             longer I can hold this" dance and I just ran out without 
             my keys.  Have you ever seen him do that dance?
    **Frasier:** Just the droll impression of it you do at parties, Dad.
     **Daphne:**[_again eating cookies_] You know, Mr. Crane, Eddie seems 
             awfully fidgety.  I don't think he got enough exercise 
             on that walk.
     **Martin:** Anybody needs any exercise, it's you, the way you're eating 
             now.  You know, when they put "Party Size" on that cookie 
             bag, they don't mean party of one. 
    _The doorbell rings again.  Frasier takes the bag and Daphne composes 
    herself again -- then opens the door to Simon.
    _
     **Daphne:** Simon!  What do you want?
      **Simon:** Well, I've just come to borrow a pen so I can fill out this 
             job application.
    **Frasier:** What?  Oh, you're applying for work?  Well here, allow me. 
             [_Gives him a pen_] Gosh, we'll miss you around here, but 
             onward and upward! [_laughs_] So, what's the job?
      **Simon:** Doorman.  
    _Frasier gasps and staggers, as Daphne supports him._
    **Frasier:** Dear God.
      **Simon:** Well, it's ideal for me, really.  Nice cozy chair, plenty 
             of time to think the long, long thoughts of youth.  Not to 
             mention what the uniforms do for the ladies, ah? [_laughs_] 
             If memory serves, a certain bellhop back in Manchester found 
             that out with a young lady who will remain nameless.
     **Daphne:** Simon! [_to Frasier_] I tell you, I'm this close to just poppin' 
             him one!
    **Frasier:** Now, now Daphne.  Daphne, you just have to calm down.  Here, 
             have a cookie. [_Gives her the bag, she eats one_]
      **Simon:** What is up with your appetite lately?  What, are you knocked 
             up or somethin'? 
     **Daphne:** Of course not! 
    _She storms toward him, Frasier grabs her._
      **Simon:** Now, now, you wouldn't be the first person in our family to be 
             walking down the aisle carrying more than just a bouquet.
    _Daphne lunges at him, with Frasier holding her back.  
    The doorbell rings again._
    **Frasier:** Uh, Simon, why don't you finish filling that out in the 
             kitchen and help yourself to a beer?
      **Simon:** Well, great!  
    _He goes to the kitchen.  Frasier takes the bag as Daphne composes 
    herself again... and opens the door to-_
     **Daphne:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Hi, guys!  Hey, Frasier?  I felt kinda bad about the other day, 
             dumping you as my wedding date...
    **Frasier:** You want me back, don't you?
        **Roz:** And I'm sick about it.  But I can't find anybody else.
    **Frasier:** Sorry Roz, I already invited somebody else, she's driving up 
             on Saturday to join me.
        **Roz:** Well, get rid of her!  I need a date!  I'm desperate!
    _Simon enters from the kitchen with a beer._
      **Simon:** Well, well, somebody here is singin' my favorite song. 
        **Roz:** Simon?  There's a guy who lives in the park across the street 
             from me.  He wears a cat suit and meows at people.  If he's 
             busy, maybe I'll call you.
      **Simon:** I'm prettying myself up, just in case.  Speaking of which,
             Daphne, I borrowed your blow dryer for my job interview.
     **Daphne:** I spent an hour looking for that!  I thought I was losing 
             my mind!
      **Simon:** Well, that does happen to women in your condition.  You know, 
             in the family way.
     **Martin:**[_entering_] You're pregnant?
     **Daphne:** I AM NOT PREGNANT!
      **Simon:** What, just another scare, then?  Like that time back in school 
             with that Pakistani chap?
     **Daphne:**[_lunges at him_] Right, that's it, you pig! 
    _Roz ducks out of the way.  Frasier gets in front of her, scoops her 
    over his shoulder and heads for the door._
     **Daphne:** Oh, put me down!
    **Frasier:** Daphne and I are going out for a breath of fresh air, 
             perhaps retrieve her blow dryer.  Oh, if Niles should 
             happen to stop by, keep him here.  There's something 
             important I need to discuss with him.  
    _He is going out into the hall as he says this.  
    
    Reset to: Hallway
    He shuts the door._
     **Daphne:** Oh, for God's sake, put me down!
    **Frasier:** Not until you promise not to kill your brother. 
    _The elevator opens, he goes in and puts her down.  There is a 
    neighbor with a basket of laundry next to them._
     **Daphne:** Oh, all right!  It's not as if he doesn't deserve it, telling 
             everyone I'm carrying Donny's baby!  Like I don't have enough 
             to worry about today, waiting for Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, Daphne, you have to calm down. 
     **Daphne:** It's not easy.  I don't even know how to begin with him.  
             "Would you like steak or salmon at my wedding?  And by 
             the way, I think I might be in love with you."
    **Frasier:** You'll find the words when the time comes, all right? [_Glares 
             at the neighbor_] And don't pretend you're not listening, Mrs. 
             Richman!  Your laundry is not that interesting.
    
    [_N.B. Mrs. Richman is Doris from_ [[5.09]](/frasier/transcripts/season_5/episode_9/perspectives_on_christmas.html "Perspectives On Christmas"), "Perspectives on Christmas."_]
    _Back in the apartment, Roz is on the phone._
        **Roz:** Oh, come on George, I'm desperate here.  I promise you a 
             good time.  I mean a REALLY good time, if you get my drift. 
             [_Pause_] You might have mentioned I was on speaker-phone!  
    _She disconnects._
      **Simon:** Listen to what you're doing, Roz.  It's not very dignified, 
             is it?
     **Martin:** Come on Roz, give Simon a chance.
        **Roz:** So he can stand me up again?
      **Simon:** And miss my sister's wedding?  Never!  If you're worried about 
             my appearance, I know where I can get my hands on some very 
             nice Armani suits.
     **Martin:** Or you could just grab one out of Frasier's closet.
        **Roz:** What did you think he was talking about?  All right.  
             But Simon, just remember my ex-boyfriend will be there.  
             If anybody asks, you're an internet millionaire.
      **Simon:** Right.  I'll be the perfect, well-bred, up-market gentleman.  
             Now, I'll walk you to the garage.
        **Roz:** Ah, you don't have to.
      **Simon:** No, it's no bother.  I live there.
    _They go to the door and open it to find (at last!) Niles.
    He is wearing a large grin._
      **Niles:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Simon!
      **Simon:** Well, by the look of that smile on your face, I'd say somebody 
             got himself a bit last night. [_gestures lewdly with arms_]
      **Niles:**[_looking shocked and appalled_] I find that remark rude, 
             boorish and IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY! [_Breaks out laughing_]
      **Simon:** Brilliant!  
    _Simon gives Niles a punch in the arm, knocking him back into the 
    hallway.  Roz just looks disgusted as they leave.  Niles comes in._
     **Martin:** Niles, how was your trip?
      **Niles:** Oh, fantastic, Dad.  Where's Frasier?  I have some news.
     **Martin:** He'll be back in a bit.  What's up?
      **Niles:** Oh, well, uh, I should wait for Frasier, it was really his 
             idea.  Do you mind?
     **Martin:** I can wait.
      **Niles:** Okay, I can't!
     **Martin:** What is it?
      **Niles:** I'm married!
    _Beat._
     **Martin:** Married?
      **Niles:** Yes, Mel and I eloped yesterday. [_Martin is stunned_] Well?
     **Martin:**[_gets up to hug him_] Well... congratulations, son!  That's 
             great.  So, uh, you're happy, right?
      **Niles:** Oh, happy?  I'm delirious!
     **Martin:** Yeah, you'd have to be, wouldn't you?  So, you say this was 
             Frasier's idea?
      **Niles:** Well, indirectly, yeah.  Oh, oh, before I forget: it occurred 
             to me, I think we should keep this from Daphne and Donny.  I 
             would hate for them to think we were stealing their thunder.  
    _Frasier comes in._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, three guesses what I did yesterday...
    **Frasier:** What?  
    _Daphne enters behind him (with her blow dryer)._
      **Niles:** Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:**[_to Martin_] Oh, send Daphne away.
     **Daphne:**[_to Frasier_] Get rid of your father.
     **Martin:** Daphne, could you go to the drugstore?  I'm all out of 
             liniment and my back's gettin' kinda achy.
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, that's because you've been sitting in that 
             chair all day.  I'll tell you what, you know what you could 
             use?  A good walk to the drugstore.  Do you a world of good.  
             I'll go with you.  
    _Frasier grabs Martin's arm and cane and starts dragging him to 
    the door._
     **Martin:** Well, okay, all right.  Niles, why don't you come too?
      **Niles:** Yeah, we'll all go. [_He starts to follow_]
    **Frasier:** No, no, there's something very important I need to discuss 
             with Dad, Niles.  I'm sure you understand.
     **Martin:** Fras...!  
    _Frasier slams the door behind them.  Niles and Daphne look at each 
    other a moment and then Niles's cell phone goes off._
      **Niles:** Oh, excuse me. [_Answers phone_] Hello?  Mel, darling! 
             Oh, just hanging out with Daphne.
    _CUT TO: the hallway. 
    Frasier and Martin are waiting for the elevator._
    **Frasier:** Honestly Dad, when will you learn to take a hint? 
     **Martin:** I can't take a hint?  Couldn't you see that Niles wanted 
             to talk to you?
    _The elevator opens and they get on.  Mrs. Richman is there, without 
    the basket, apparently going back for another load._
    **Frasier:** Well, whatever it is, it can wait.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah!  No big deal, he just got married, that's all!
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** He eloped with Mel yesterday.
    **Richman:** Poor Daphne...
    **Frasier:** Would you please keep out of this, Mrs. Richman?  We have got 
             to get back up there. [_Stabs at the buttons_]
     **Martin:** We're going to the basement.
    **Frasier:** I can't wait that long!  
    _The doors open on a lower floor.  Frasier runs around the corner 
    to the stairs.
    
    CUT BACK TO: the living room._
      **Niles:**[_on phone_] I'll see you later, darling. [_Hangs up_] Sorry about 
             that.
     **Daphne:** It's all right.
    _Niles sits down on the couch._
      **Niles:** So, forty-eight hours 'til the big day, you must be pretty 
             excited.
     **Daphne:** It's funny you should mention that. [_Sits on the couch beside 
             him_] You see, Dr. Crane...
      **Niles:** Yes, Daphne?
    **Frasier:**[_bursts through door_] NILES!  
    _Niles and Daphne stand up in shock; Frasier freezes in the door, 
    wondering if his entrance was precipitous._
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane!  You're back awfully soon!
      **Niles:** You're all out of breath, is something wrong?
    **Frasier:** Ah, no, no.  It's just there's something I need to discuss 
             with Niles.
     **Daphne:** What, now?  We were just having a chat!
    **Frasier:** Well I'm sure it can wait.
      **Niles:** Actually Daphne, I need to talk to Frasier, too.  If you 
             don't mind.
     **Daphne:** Oh!  Of course not!  It's not like I have anything 
             important to talk about!  
    _She storms off to her room, grabbing the bag of cookies on her way.  
    Martin comes in behind Frasier._
      **Niles:** Daphne all right?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, it's just wedding stuff, I guess.  Speaking of which, 
             I understand you have some, some news?  You're married?
      **Niles:** Yes.  I guess Dad couldn't contain himself any more than 
             I could.  
    **Frasier:** Well, I thought you were just gonna move in together.
      **Niles:** Well, so did I!  But then the strangest thing happened.  
             As we talked about it, we got more and more excited about 
             the idea of being together.  And then I remembered your 
             advice.  
    _Martin gives Frasier a very hooded look right here._
      **Niles:** To stop taking baby steps through life.  Before we knew it, 
             we were asking the waitress for a phone book so we could 
             find a justice-of-the-peace.
    _The doorbell rings, Martin gets it._
    **Frasier:** Well, what can I say, but... congratulations.
      **Niles:** Thank you! 
    _They hug.  Martin opens the door, it is Mel with a bottle of champagne._
        **Mel:** Martin!  Or should I say "Dad"?
     **Martin:**[_nervous_] Yeah, I heard.
    **Frasier:** Mel.
    _Daphne comes out of her room behind Niles._
      **Niles:** Darling... oh, darling, it occurred to me that perhaps we 
             should keep this quiet from Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Keep what quiet?
        **Mel:** Oh, we can't keep something like this a secret! [_takes 
             Niles's hand_] We got married!
     **Daphne:**[_freezes for a second, then_] Did you?
    _Behind Niles and Mel, Frasier looks heartsick._
      **Niles:** Yes, while we were out of town.  But the last thing we want 
             is to upstage you and Donny, so we are not mentioning this 
             outside this room.  
    _Mel makes a little lip-locking gesture._
     **Daphne:**[_coming to them and taking each of their hands_] Well, I am 
             just so happy for you both.
      **Niles:** We're having champagne.  Would you like to join us?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'd love to.  But I have to get a check down to the 
             caterers, they're closing early today.
    **Frasier:** Let me drive you over, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no, I'm fine.  Congratulations again.  Oh, save a glass 
             for me. 
    _CUT TO: the hallway.
    She goes out into the hallway.  We follow as she pushes the button 
    for the elevator.  Her shoulders shake with sobs she is holding back.  
    
    As the elevator doors open, her face breaks and she lets out a sob.  
    Mrs. Richman is standing there with her basket.  She puts it down, 
    opens her arms and takes Daphne into a hug to cry on her shoulder.
