    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Radio Station.
    Roz is organizing some carts with her baby daughter Alice in her 
    arms.  Alice is dressed in a cute turkey suit.  Frasier enters her 
    booth and greets them._
        **Roz:** Morning, Fras.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz.  Roz, is baby Alice dressed as a little turkey or am 
             I just very, very hungry? [_laughs_]
        **Roz:** We're flying home for Thanksgiving right after the show.  
             I thought I'd make Alice look as cute as possible so if 
             she cries on the plane, the other passengers can't get mad. 
             Actually, what I like to do is keep her awake so she'll 
             sleep on the plane.
    **Frasier:** You know, you should just do what I used to do.  I used to 
             tell the passengers that if Frederick cried, I'd buy them 
             all a drink.
        **Roz:** And that worked?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  In fact, one time I awoke from a short nap, and the 
             fellow sitting behind us was flicking the back of Frederick's 
             little ear.  Of course that was cheating, the man did not get 
             his drink.
    _They cross to Frasier's booth._
        **Roz:** So when is Frederick coming anyway?
    **Frasier:** Well, Lilith is dropping him off around noon and then she's 
             off to visit a colleague for Thanksgiving in Vancouver.  You 
             know, come to think of it, do they even celebrate Thanksgiving 
             in Canada?
        **Roz:** They will when she leaves!
    _Frasier nods in agreement as they begin the show.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **AS ALL OF VANCOUVER KNEELS TO GIVE THANKS...**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    The doorbell sounds.  Frasier answers it to reveal Lilith and 
    Frederick._
    **Freddie:** Hi, Dad. [_hugs him_]
    **Frasier:** Frederick, hi. 
     **Lilith:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Hello.  Oh, gosh, you know, I was starting to get worried 
             about you.  You're an hour late.
    **Freddie:** We saw a big accident on the freeway.  Mom saved this guy's          
             life.
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Lilith:** Well, that's going a bit far.  I simply applied a tourniquet.
    **Freddie:** She's a hero.
    **Frasier:**[_skeptically_] Yes, that's your mother all right, son.
    **Freddie:** Then the paramedics came and wanted to give mom a transfusion.
    **Frasier:**[_jokily_] Yes, that's your mother all right, son.
     **Lilith:** If you don't mind, I'd like to use the phone and call my 
             colleague and tell him I'll be late.
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.  Who is this colleague anyway?
     **Lilith:**[_crosses to the phone and begins dialing_] He's the man who 
             supplies me with lab rats.  It's about time we got together 
             socially.  I've known him for over fifty-two generations. 
    **Frasier:** Ah.  Well, if the drumsticks are about this big [_shows a 
             couple of centimeters with his fingers_], you'll know why.
    **Freddie:** Good one, Dad.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, son.
    _Lilith has just connected._
     **Lilith:** Hello, Peter, it's Lilith.  Listen, I'm running about an 
             hour late, so... [_pause_] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
             Well, take care of yourself.  Okay.  Goodbye. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** What happened?
     **Lilith:** Peter's come down with something.  He thinks he caught it 
             from the rats.
    **Frasier:** Oh, now, nobody caught anything from a rat that wasn't 
             resolved in a day or two, off you go.
    
    [_N.B. History has taken it for granted that the Black Death, to which
    this joke is obviously referring, was bubonic plague, which would have
    been spread by ticks and fleas jumping off the hides of rats.  However,
    recent research has suggested that the Black Death might actually have 
    been a form of anthrax, in which case the rats were innocent and the 
    cows were to blame._]
    
    **Freddie:** Gee, mom, why don't you spend Thanksgiving with us?
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's a very good one, Frederick.  Go kiss your mother 
             goodbye and unpack, all right?
    _Frederick complies to his father's wishes and exits to his Dad's room._
     **Lilith:** Would it be so unbearable for me to be here for one meal?  
             As soon as we're done, I'll go and check into a hotel. I can 
             spend the weekend working on an article I've been writing.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, Niles is coming this afternoon, and it'll be 
             very uncomfortable, I think.  You know, you two haven't seen 
             each other since your little tryst.
     **Lilith:** Oh please, Niles and I are adults. 
    **Frasier:** I suppose you're right.  It would mean a lot to Frederick. 
             After all, Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate family.
    _Keys are heard jingling in the corridor.  Frasier half opens the door 
    to Martin who doesn't see the company._
     **Martin:** Is the witch gone yet?
    **Frasier:** Lilith's still here, Dad.
     **Martin:**[_shocked then collects himself_] Oh, in that case, I'll ask 
             you too, Lilith.  Has my twitch gone yet? [_twitches_] I had 
             some very strong coffee this morning and...
     **Lilith:** Skillfully done, Martin.
    _Martin enters, closing the door behind him, as Frederick appears._
    **Freddie:** Grandpa!
     **Martin:** Oh, Freddie! [_hugs him_] How ya doing?
    **Freddie:** So, Dad, is Mom staying for dinner?
     **Lilith:** Yes, Frederick, I am.
    **Freddie:** Isn't that great, Grandpa?
     **Martin:**[_through his teeth_] Great, Freddie!  Real great!  Isn't that 
             great, Freddie?!
    **Freddie:** Are you okay, Grandpa?
     **Lilith:**[_hanging up her coat_] He's worried about his twitch!
    _The doorbell sounds.  Frasier opens the door to Daphne, arms full with 
    grocery bags, trying to tug a stubborn Eddie inside._
     **Daphne:** Come on, Eddie, come on. 
    **Frasier:** What's the matter?
     **Daphne:** Well, he was perfectly fine until a block from here.  Then he 
             started whining and trembling, like he senses an earthquake 
             or a dark force or- [_not really noticing her_] hello, Lilith -
             a vortex of evil. [_notices her properly_]
    _Martin takes Eddie and carefully takes him into the kitchen, shielding 
    him from evil with his overcoat._
    **Freddie:** I'll help with the groceries.
     **Daphne:**[_hands them to him_] Hey, Freddie.  Thank you. [_kisses him_] 
             Well, let's see how the turkey's coming. 
    _Daphne exits to the kitchen with Frederick._
    **Frasier:** Yes, Daphne's preparing dinner.
     **Lilith:** Oh, should we tell her there's an extra person?
    _Clatterings of groceries are heard in the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** No need.
    _Lilith takes a seat on the couch as the doorbell sounds.  Frasier 
    answers it to Niles._
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier. 
    _He notices Lilith and crosses to her, sitting on the couch.  
    He becomes very monotone._
      **Niles:** Hello, Lilith.  Lovely to see you again. [_kisses her_]
     **Lilith:** Nice to see you, too.
      **Niles:** I trust your flight was uneventful?
     **Lilith:** Up, down, bumpy over the mountains.
      **Niles:** Isn't that always the way?
    **Frasier:** Lilith is joining us for dinner, Niles.
      **Niles:** What a nice surprise.
     **Lilith:** It certainly is for me.
      **Niles:** Well, not as nice as it is for me.
    _Frasier is becoming very agitated by all this "nice" conversation._
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it, both of you! I refuse to spend the day listening 
             to your distilled chatter!
      **Niles:** Well, how would you have us behave?
    **Frasier:** Well, why don't you try going back to your former relationship?
     **Lilith:** All we did was insult each other. 
    **Frasier:** Yes!  You're willing to throw all that away just because of 
             one ill-considered night of passion?!  It happened, take from 
             it what you can learn, move on!
      **Niles:** Well, I learned if you kiss her too fast you get an ice-cream 
             headache.
     **Lilith:** You also learned that I have twice your upper body strength, 
             so shut your pie hole!
    **Frasier:** Was that so hard?
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Later in the day Daphne is mashing the potatoes in the kitchen when 
    Martin enters.  Bits of dishes are laid out on the side including a 
    plate of cranberry sauce._
     **Martin:** Wait, wait, what are you doing?!
     **Daphne:** I'm mashing the potatoes.
     **Martin:** By hand?  You're supposed to whip potatoes, therefore every 
             bite tastes the same.
     **Daphne:** Isn't that a bit bland?
     **Martin:** Hello?  Welcome to potatoes!  Could you just once cook a 
             traditional Thanksgiving meal?  I mean, look at this cranberry 
             sauce. [_points to a dish of nicely smoothed sauce_] It's 
             supposed to keep the shape of the can, quiver a little bit. 
             What are all these little chunks in there? 
     **Daphne:** Those are cranberries.
    _Niles enters with a box from a baker's._
      **Niles:** Dad, here you are, one frozen pumpkin pie on request.
     **Daphne:** Honestly, wouldn't you rather I just bake a pie from scratch?
     **Martin:** Is it that you CAN'T learn or you WON'T learn?
    _Martin exits in disgust as Frederick enters after laying a superb 
    arrangement on the table._
    **Freddie:** I'm done setting the table.
      **Niles:** Oh, you did set the table... [_looks_] It looks very nice, 
             very elegant, Frederick.
     **Daphne:** Oh yes, Freddie's been quite the little helper.  Every time 
             I bend over to check the turkey, there he is.
    _Niles gives Frederick a sly look.  Meanwhile, in the room Frasier and 
    Lilith are chatting._
    **Frasier:** So, Lilith, tell me about this article you are writing.
    **Freddie:**[_enters_] It's about me.
     **Lilith:** Essentially, yes.  I was talking to a friend that works at 
             the _New York Times Magazine_ about raising a child after 
             divorce and she pointed out that as a psychiatrist, I might 
             have a unique perspective. 
    **Freddie:** You know, since it's about me, shouldn't I get something 
             for it?
     **Lilith:** You're not getting a minibike.
    **Freddie:** But Mom...! 
     **Lilith:** We have talked about this.  You can get one when you are 
             fifteen.
    **Freddie:** But all my friends have minibikes.
     **Lilith:** Yes, and if all of your friends decided to enter a Level 
             Four biohazard area without their environmental containment 
             suits, would you do that too?
    **Freddie:** This is different!
     **Lilith:** No, it's not. 
    **Freddie:** Dad!
    **Frasier:** Sorry Frederick, I'm with your mother on this one.
     **Daphne:**[_from kitchen_] Dinner's almost ready! 
     **Lilith:** Excuse me.
    _Lilith gets up and leaves to the powder room._
    **Freddie:** You know what I think, Dad?  You and mom should write this 
             article together. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure your mom can write it without my help.
    **Freddie:** But it was her idea, she told me on the plane how much easier 
             it would be.  I just don't think she knows how to ask you.
    **Frasier:** It is an intriguing idea.
    _Daphne enters._
     **Martin:**[_from kitchen_] Frasier!  I could use some help out here.
     **Daphne:** He's picking the raisins out of the stuffing!
    **Frasier:** Oh Lord!  Coming, Dad.
    _Daphne and Frasier exit back to the kitchen.  Then Lilith enters back 
    from the powder room and sits with her son._
    **Freddie:** You know, I think you and Dad should write this article 
             together.
     **Lilith:** Together?  Well, I think the last thing your father wants 
             is to collaborate with me. 
    **Freddie:** But it was his idea.  He just told me how much fun it would 
             be. 
     **Lilith:** Well, it's an interesting notion.
    _Niles and Daphne enter from the kitchen.  Niles is carrying a carved 
    turkey._
     **Daphne:** Beautiful job carving that turkey, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Well, I picked up a thing or two in medical school.  In case 
             you're wondering, this bird appears to have died of a massive 
             head trauma.
    _Daphne and Niles share a laugh as Lilith guides Freddie to the table._ 
     **Lilith:** Did you wash your hands, Frederick?
    **Freddie:** Yeah.  Uncle Niles even showed me how to open the door with 
             my elbow so I don't need to touch the handle.
      **Niles:** What are uncles for?
     **Lilith:** Daphne, is your fiancee joining us?
     **Daphne:** No, I'll be seeing him later.  Donny has his own Thanksgiving 
             tradition.  He has a dinner for all the divorced men he's 
             represented during the year.  He's hosting twenty-five today.
     **Lilith:** Wow!  Twenty-five lonely, bitter men.
     **Daphne:** It's been a good year. 
    _Niles pulls out the chair next to Daphne so that he can sit by her, 
    however Freddie beats him to it._
    **Freddie:** Uncle Niles, mom's writing an article about me.
      **Niles:** Really?
     **Lilith:** It's about raising a child after divorce.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it sounds fascinating, doesn't it?  It's a subject that's 
             very near and dear to my own heart.
     **Lilith:** Are you suggesting we collaborate?
    **Frasier:** Well, if you think I might be helpful.
    **Freddie:** What a great idea, you can write it together.
    **Frasier:** I'd be willing.
     **Lilith:** Well, we certainly did well on our first collaboration. 
             [_glances at Frederick_]
    **Frasier:** You know, Lilith, we could probably get most of it done in 
             the time you're still here in town.
    **Freddie:** And if you stay here, you can finish the whole thing. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I guess it would be alright by me.
     **Lilith:** Daphne, would that be too much of an imposition?
     **Daphne:** Not at all, I'll be spending the weekend with Donny. [_rises_] 
             Now, where is your father with that gravy? [_exits to kitchen_]
     **Lilith:** Then I'll stay here.  Although maybe we should run this 
             by your father.
    _The clattering of a gravy boat is heard from the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** No need.
    _End of Act One.
    
    Act Two._ 
    **THE APPARENT TRAP**
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Lilith and Frasier working through some notes on the couch.  Lilith's 
    hair has been taken out of its bun and they are sharing a glass of 
    wine._
     **Lilith:** Yes, but I think we should have something about non 
             custodial parents and discipline.
    **Frasier:** Exactly!  The weekend the father needn't be a weakened 
             father.
     **Lilith:**[_laughs_] Frasier, you still have a direct line to my funny 
             bone.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Thank Goodness the line wasn't stop.
     **Lilith:**[_laughs_] Stop!  Now, if we laugh all night, we'll never get 
             any work done.
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Bedroom.
    Meanwhile, Frederick is sat on Frasier's bed playing a video game 
    on the television screen.  He seems very much into it.  There is a 
    knock at the door and Niles enters and sits with him._
      **Niles:** Hey Frederick, I'm leaving. [_notices screen_] Whatcha doing? 
    **Freddie:** I'm saving the universe.  Do you want to help?
      **Niles:**[_laughs_] I wouldn't know where to begin.
    **Freddie:** It's easy, I'll show you.
      **Niles:** All right, what do you do?
    **Freddie:**[_hands him controller_] That's your guy, you've just escaped 
             from an intergalactic maximum security prison pod. 
      **Niles:** Like they could hold me.
    **Freddie:** Now once you leave this chamber, you can go left or right, 
             and different things will happen to you.
    _Niles tries to play and in an instant a scream in heard from the game._
      **Niles:** What happened?
    **Freddie:** Wow!  I never saw the guy trip and fall before.  Try it 
             again, you have two lives left.
      **Niles:** Okay. [_tries again but fails_] I can't seem to get out of 
             this room, is this some sort of advanced level?
    **Freddie:** No, this is like the training area.  I didn't even know you 
             could die here! 
      **Niles:**[_tries again but fails_] I have to get out of this room!
    **Freddie:** The reset button's on the right.  Do you want something to 
             drink? [_rises_]
      **Niles:** Quiet! 
    _Niles carries on playing as Frederick slips out of the room.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    A minute or two later, Frasier is washing the dishes in the kitchen. 
    Frederick enters._
    **Freddie:** Hi, Dad.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi son.
    **Freddie:** How's the writing?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's coming along nicely, thanks.
    **Freddie:** Oh, mom wants to know if you're bringing over the wine?
    **Frasier:** Oh, of course, yes. [_picks up wine glass_]
    **Freddie:** You know, it's great to see you and Mom working together. 
             I think she kinda misses you.
    **Frasier:** Really?
    **Freddie:** Yes, she talks about you all the time. Y ou know, how 
             wonderful you are and how she's never met another man 
             like you. [_pointing to glass of wine_] You go take that 
             out to her, I'll finish up in here. 
    **Frasier:** Thank you, son.
    _Frasier exits the kitchen and enters the main room.  He hands the 
    glass to Lilith but stands firmly away from her._
    **Frasier:** There you are.
     **Lilith:**[_surprised_] Oh, thank you.  I've been rearranging this 
             outline, why don't you take a look. 
    _Lilith holds up the piece of paper.  Frasier, not wanting to get 
    closer, briefly glances at it._
    **Frasier:** Looks fine.
     **Lilith:** Frasier, you can't see it from there, sit down. [_he does_] 
             You know, I'm really enjoying this collaboration.
    **Frasier:** Me too.
     **Lilith:** Is it me, or is it getting warm? [_takes her jacket off 
             revealing her bare shoulders_]
    **Frasier:**[_shaken up_] It is a little warm!
    _Eddie then rushes out from the corridor and heads straight to the door.  
    He scratches at the door with fury trying to get out as Martin follows 
    him._
     **Martin:** All right, boy, I'm coming, I'm coming. 
    **Frasier:**[_rises_] Dad, let me walk you out.  There's something I want 
             to discuss with you.
     **Martin:** You know, I've never seen him so eager to take a walk, 
             I wonder what... [_notices Lilith_] Oh, right.
    _Eddie, Martin and Frasier exit the apartment as Frederick enters from 
    the kitchen._
    **Freddie:** Hey, mom.  How's the article going?
     **Lilith:** Very well, thank you.
    **Freddie:** You know, I've never seen Dad this happy.
     **Lilith:** Oh, what do you mean?
    **Freddie:** Well, all he does is talk about you.  How pretty you look 
             and how smart you are and how much he misses you.
     _Reset to: Hallway
    Meanwhile, Martin and Frasier are having a one to one in the corridor._
     **Martin:** What makes you think she's coming on to you?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually Frederick told me, but you know, it actually 
             makes sense.  I mean, this colleague of hers gets mysteriously 
             ill and then she lassoes me into writing this article with her 
             and then all of a sudden before I know it, the bun is off and 
             she's waggling her bare shoulder at me.
     **Martin:** Hey, some of us just had a big meal!
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Bedroom.
    Niles is sprawled out on the bed intensely playing the video game.  
    A knock is heard at the door._
      **Niles:** It's not your turn yet, I still have two more lives.
     **Lilith:**[_enters_] It's Lilith.
    _As she says this the computer gives out a "scream" as Niles fails 
    again which adds to the comic timing.  Lilith enters, shutting the 
    door behind her, and sits on the bed next to Niles._
     **Lilith:** I need to talk to you.
      **Niles:** Does the door have to be closed?
     **Lilith:** I thinks it's best, it's of a personal nature.
      **Niles:** What's this about? 
     **Lilith:** Well, it's about an attraction that I thought was over and 
             now I'm beginning to think, maybe it's not.
      **Niles:** Usually in my dreams, this is where I try to run and can't.
     **Lilith:** This isn't about you, you egomaniac.  This is about Frasier.  
             I think he wants us together again.
      **Niles:** He knows how I feel about you.
     **Lilith:** Not us!  Me and Frasier!  Is there a chair here I could talk 
             to?!
    _Once again Niles fails on his computer game, and the scream is heard._
      **Niles:** Well, what makes you think he wants you to get back together?
     **Lilith:** Well, first he offers to collaborate on this article, now he's 
             plying me with wine and at this very moment I expect he's 
             asking your father to clear out for the night.
      **Niles:** So he took a professional interest in your article and he 
             offered you some wine on Thanksgiving.  Now who's the 
             egomaniac?
     **Lilith:** Perhaps I am overreacting.  I'll just have to keep my eyes 
             peeled for more conclusive evidence.
    _Lilith takes over the game pad and starts playing on the computer. 
    From the way she plays, you can tell she is a pro at the game._
      **Niles:** I didn't know there was a door there!
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Five - Frasier's Aparment.
    In the corridor, Frasier and Martin are still conferring._
    **Frasier:** Then again, maybe I've just made this whole thing up in my 
             head.  Tell you what, Dad.  Take a minute and then come back 
             in.  See what you think's going on in there and then find 
             some subtle way to tell me what you think.
     **Martin:** All right, okay.  Just give me a minute.
    _Meanwhile, inside the apartment, Frederick is lighting romantic 
    candles.  He then turns the lights down low and switches on some light, 
    classical music on the stereo.  As Frasier enters, his son runs off to 
    his bedroom.  Frasier is worried by this environment.  He notices the 
    bottle of wine on the table and quickly hides it away in the kitchen.  
    Lilith the enters also noticing the aura of the room.  She is slightly 
    angered by this as Frasier enters.  They confront each other._
     **Lilith:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Lilith.
     **Lilith:**[_worried_] Well, isn't this nice?
    **Frasier:**[_worried_] Yes, very nice.
    _Then Martin enters, and swiftly takes in the music, the lights,
    the candles, and Lilith's hair and shoulders._
     **Martin:** Oh, excuse me again, I just came back to get an umbrella in 
             case it rains. [_picks one up_] But I hope it doesn't, because 
             Eddie's just dying to play this new game I taught him.  I take 
             off his leash and I say, "Run for your life!"  That's exactly 
             what I say, "Run for your life!"
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad.
     **Martin:** Okay. [_starts to leave, then_] Run for your life!
    _Martin exits._
     **Lilith:** Frasier, we have to talk.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Lilith, we do.
     **Lilith:** I mean, I can't just sit here all night waiting for you to 
             make your move.
    **Frasier:** Well, you've just got this all worked out, haven't you!
     **Lilith:** Well, let's see.  Candlelight, wine, soft music.  What else do 
             I need?
    **Frasier:** I don't know what's worse: that you want me back or that you 
             think I can be won so easily! [_switches off music_]
     **Lilith:** You think I'm responsible for this?!
    **Frasier:** You assume you can just snap your fingers and old Frasier'll 
             come-a-runnin'?!  Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way, 
             sister.  First of all I have to be finessed!
     **Lilith:** I didn't do any of this, and if you didn't either, then 
             someone is setting us up.
    **Frasier:** But who...? [_realizes_] Frederick!  He told me that you've 
             been pining for me.
     **Lilith:** He just told me the same about you.
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, here we are writing an article on taking your child 
             through a divorce and our son is nursing the hopeless fantasy 
             that we'll get back together.  We've got to go talk with him.
     **Lilith:** No, wait a minute, something is not right here.  When has 
             Frederick expressed the slightest desire to see us together?
    **Frasier:** He could have been sublimating it for years.
     **Lilith:** Even so, he lied to both of us.  He had to have known that 
             we'd compare notes.
    **Frasier:** Alright, so his plan was a little artless.
     **Lilith:** Unless... That's exactly what he wanted.
    **Frasier:** What do you mean?
     **Lilith:** Think about it.  He makes us believe that he wants us 
             together, of course we have to tell him that that's not 
             going to happen.  His hopes are dashed and we feel so 
             guilty that we compensate by getting him something he wants.
    **Frasier:** A minibike?
     **Lilith:** That's a very clever little boy we have.
    **Frasier:** Could he actually be so devious?
     **Lilith:** Ah, well, if he wants something badly enough, he will figure 
             out a way to get it.  Remember when he was a baby, the bottle 
             at the end of the maze?
    **Frasier:** You know, I kinda regret doing that.
     **Lilith:**[_calls_] Frederick!
    **Frasier:** What are you going to do?  Just come out and ask him?
     **Lilith:** Of course not, he'll only deny it. 
    **Frasier:** What then?
     **Lilith:** Just go with me on this one.
    _Frederick enters._
     **Lilith:** Frederick, have a seat, we need to talk to you.
    **Freddie:**[_sits_] What about?
     **Lilith:** We know that you've been trying to maneuver us together 
             and it's only natural for a child of divorce to want that. 
             Generally speaking, your plan would be fruitless, but when 
             your father and I let down our guard and looked at each 
             other in the candlelight, we realized that we belong 
             together.  In other words, we're getting remarried.
    _Lilith links hands with a very anxious Frasier who tries to cover 
    this up with a broad grin._
    **Freddie:** Do you really mean it? [_Frasier nods in "delight"_] This is 
             going to be the best Christmas ever!  I'm gonna go tell 
             Uncle Niles.
    _Frederick exits to his room._
    **Frasier:** Have you lost your mind?!
     **Lilith:** He's cooler than I thought.
    **Frasier:** Cooler?!  This isn't a game of poker!  This is our son being 
             lied to by his parents.  We've got to go in there, tell him 
             the truth and make it up to him.  Even if it takes a fleet of 
             minibikes!
     **Lilith:** No, no, Frasier.  Please, we called his bluff.  Now, he's 
             calling ours.  The question is, what's our next move?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I know, why don't we just consult this handy little 
             guide for divorced parents?! [_points to their article_]
     **Lilith:** We can't blink first, we've got to up the ante.
    **Frasier:** Good idea, Lilith! [_sarcastic_] You know what?  Let's go in 
             there and promise him the baby brother he'll never have!
    _Frederick and Niles then enter.  Niles has an expression on his face 
    that kills me with laughter every time I see it.  It is a mix of fake 
    joy, worry, and anger._
      **Niles:** What's this joyous news I hear?
     **Lilith:** You know, Frederick, you're going to have to give up all of 
             your friends, because we're going to live here in Seattle. 
    **Freddie:** I'd live anywhere to be a family again.
      **Niles:**[_in one long breath_] So it is true, congratulations to you 
             both, good night. [_heads to door_]
    **Freddie:** Don't you want your coat, Uncle Niles?
      **Niles:** No, thank you! 
    _Niles walks, very stiffly, towards and out of the door, not even 
    looking back at the "happy couple."_
    **Freddie:** I'm going to go call my friends.  I love you. [_exits_]
     **Lilith:** I don't understand, I was so sure.
    **Frasier:** Oh gee, don't be so tough on yourself, Lilith.  After all, 
             what parent doesn't at one time or another completely 
             obliterate their child's chances of ever trusting another 
             human being?!  Oh well, there he is.  Telling his friends 
             that all of his dreams have come true.
     **Lilith:** Unless that's what he wants us to think?
    **Frasier:** When will you stop?!
    _Lilith goes over to the phone and clicks onto speaker phone on which 
    Frederick is chatting to his friend._
    **Freddie:**[_v.o._] It worked!  All I did was tap into my parents' feelings 
             of inadequacy and they crumbled.
        **Boy:**[_v.o._] What does that mean?
    **Freddie:** I'm getting the minibike.
     **Lilith:**[_into phone_] Frederick.
    **Freddie:** Uh-oh! [_hangs up_]
    _Lilith and Frasier are relieved._
     **Lilith:** Do I know my son, or do I know my son?
    **Frasier:** He was willing to put us through absolute hell just for a 
             minibike? 
     **Lilith:** You know what this means, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes... he's normal.  We're not bad parents.  Well done, Dr. 
             Sternin.
     **Lilith:** Well done, Dr. Crane.
    _They hi-five._
     **Lilith:** Well, we really should get in there.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I suppose we should.  Must be sheer torment for him, 
             waiting for the axe to fall.
     **Lilith:** Absolute hell.
    **Frasier:** Absolute nightmare. 
    _And then:_
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Wine?
     **Lilith:** Love some.
    _Frasier hands Lilith her wine glass as they sit down to relax.
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne kneels next to Frederick on the bed as he pretends to struggle
    with the video game.  Finally she takes pity on him and puts her
    arms around his to help him work the controls.  Frederick looks at
    her with a rather Niles-like expression of satisfaction as at least 
    one plan works out for the day.

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    THE APPARENT TRAP  
    
      
    
      
    
    **ACT ONE  
    
      
    
    **SCENE ONE - THE RADIO STATION - ROZ'S BOOTH - DAY  
    
    (Frasier, Roz, Alice)  
    
      
    
    Frasier entes to find Roz holding Alice, who is dressed in a little red
    turkey outfit.  As Roz puts Alice into a playpen she explains that
    right after the show they are off to Wisconsin to visit her mother. 
    Roz asks after Frederick, and Frasier replies that Lilith will be
    dropping him off around noon, then will be flying off to visit a
    colleague in Vancouver.   Do they even celebrate Thanksgiving
    in Canada? Frasier wonders aloud.  They will when Lilith leaves,
    replies Roz.  
    
      
    
      
    
    **_Scene Title:  "As All of Vancouver Kneels to Give
    Thanks..."  
    
      
    
    **_SCENE TWO - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY  
    
    (Frasier, Lilith, Frederick, Martin, Daphne, Niles)  
    
      
    
    Lilith arrives with Frederick, an hour later than scheduled.  She
    goes over to the phone to call her colleague and tell him of her late
    arrival, only to find out that he is ill and will not be able to have
    dinner with her.  Frederick suggests that she have dinner with them,
    a suggestion Frasier discourages.  But Lilith herself asks him again
    after Frederick goes off to the bedroom to unpack.  Still Frasier
    hesitates, remarking that it would be awkward since she and Niles haven't
    seen one another since their one-night stand long ago.  _[_See
    "Room Service", season 5._]  _ Lilith replies
    impatiently that she and Niles are, after all, adults and can manage the
    situation.  Frasier agrees and gives in.  
    
      
    
    Martin comes in from outdoors, asking whether the witch has gone
    yet.  He tries to cover when he realizes Lilith is in the room, but
    it's too late.  
    
      
    
    Daphne comes in next with a bag of groceries and a reluctant Eddie,who
    refuses to enter the apartment except by being dragged at the end of his
    leash.  Daphne is puzzled and observes that it's as if he senses an
    earthquake or a disturbance in the Force.  Then she spots LIlith,
    and all is made clear.  Frederick takes the bag of groceries and
    they go out to the kitchen to check on the turkey.  
    
      
    
    Niles arrives just then, greeting Frasier affectionately and barely
    pausing when he spots Lilith.  Niles and Lilith launch into a round
    of inane social pleasantries and seem prepared to keep it up all evening,
    but Frasier interrupts impatiently.  He tells them to drop the
    stilted chatter, take what they can learn from their "one
    ill-considered night of passion" and move on.  Niles and Lilith
    agree and go back to insulting one another, and normalcy is
    restored.  
    
      
    
    SCENE THREE - FRASIER'S KITCHEN - LATER  
    
    (Martin, Daphne, Niles, Frederick)  
    
      
    
    Martin criticizes Daphne's preparations as she tries to make
    dinner:  the potatoes should be whipped rather than mashed by hand;
    the cranberry sauce has actual cranberries in it rather than being a
    jellied lump that holds the shape of the can; and Daphne still complains
    that she should have been allowed to make a homemade pumpkin pie rather
    than the frozen pie Niles purchased at Martin's request.  Martin is
    completely frustrated at Daphne's inability to grasp the essentials of
    Thanksgiving cuisine.    
    
      
    
    THE LIVING ROOM  
    
    (Frasier, Lilith, Frederick, Daphne, Niles, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Frasier asks Lilith about the article she's writing.  Frederick
    comes in and hears Lilith explaining to Frasier that it's an article
    about raising a child after a divorce, using Frederick as an
    example.  Frederick complains that he should get a reward for being
    the subject of the article, and Lilith issues what is obviously not her
    first refusal to buy him the mini-bike he wants.  Frasier
    agrees.    
    
      
    
    Daphne announces that dinner is almost ready, and Lilith excuses herself
    to the bathroom.  Frederick tells Frasier that he and Lilith should
    be writing the article together.  Frasier doubts that LIlith wants
    his help, and Frederick says she told him on the plane how much easier
    the article would be with Frasier's help.  Frasier is intrigued, but
    their conversation is interrupted by Martin, who wants Frasier's help to
    pick the raisins out of Daphne's stuffing.  He exits to the kitchen
    as Lilith returns.  
    
      
    
    Frederick sets to work on Lilith, telling her that Frasier would like to
    collaborate with her on the article.  Lilith is doubtful but also
    intrigued.  
    
      
    
    Daphne and Niles come in with the turkey, and they begin to take their
    places at the table.  Lilith asks after Donny, and Daphne tells her
    that he is hosting a dinner for all 25 of the divorced men he has
    represented during the year.  As she sits down Niles attempts to sit
    next to her, but Frederick is too quick for him and slides into the chair
    ahead of him.  They exchange a knowing smile.    
    
      
    
    As Frasier sits down at the table Frederick tells Niles that his mother
    is writing an article about him, and Niles asks about it.  Lilith
    describes the article and Frasier expresses his interest, and before long
    they are agreeing to collaborate.  Frederick presses his advantage
    by suggesting that Lilith spend the weekend at the apartment to make the
    writing easier, a suggestion Daphne agrees with since she will be
    spending the weekend with Donny.    
    
      
    
      
    
    ACT TWO   
    
      
    
    **_Scene Title:  The Apparent Trap  
    
      
    
    **_SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MUCH LATER  
    
    (Lilith, Frasier, Frederick)  
    
      
    
    Frasier and Lilith are working on the article in a very relaxed
    fashion.  Frasier sits on the floor next to the couch where Lilith
    is writing on a legal pad and laughing at his jokes.  They are
    getting along very well, for once.    
    
      
    
    SPARE BEDROOM  
    
    (Frederick, Niles)  
    
      
    
    Frederick is seated on the bed playing a video game on the television as
    Niles knocks and comes in to say goodbye.  He is interested by the
    video game and sits down next to Frederick to ask questions about
    it.  Soon Frederick hands the controls over to Niles, who promptly
    causes his game character to get killed in a number of creative and, to
    Frederick, completely new ways.  Niles is instantly hooked by the
    game, and after pointing out the location of the reset button on the
    video control, Frederick exits to get something to drink.  
    
      
    
    THE KITCHEN  
    
    (Frederick, Frasier)  
    
      
    
    Frederick greets Frasier, who is putting the final touches on the kitchen
    cleanup.  Frederick tells Frasier that Lilith has requested a glass
    of wine, and as Frasier pours, Freddie tells him how Lilith is always
    talking about how wonderful Frasier is.  Frederick volunteers to
    finish the kitchen so Frasier can bring Lilith her wine, and Frasier
    complies with a puzzled frown.  
    
      
    
    THE LIVING ROOM  
    
    (Frasier, Lilith, Frederick)  
    
      
    
    Frasier hands Lilith her wine, and she hands him the article outline to
    review.  He hesitates to come close to her, and she insists that he
    sit down on the sofa next to her to read the outline.  Nervously he
    complies.  Remarking on the warm temperature in the apartment, she
    takes off her jacket to reveal a sleeveless shell underneath, and Frasier
    is abruptly convinced she's set her sights on him.  Martin comes
    through on his way to take Eddie out for a walk, and Frasier nervously
    follows him out into the hallway for a talk.   
    
      
    
    Frederick comes in to ask about the article and to tell Lilith how pretty
    Frasier thinks she is, and how much he misses her.  Now it's
    Lilith's turn to be startled.  
    
      
    
    HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT  
    
    (Frasier, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Martin asks Frasier what makes him think Lilith is coming on to him, and
    Frasier recounts his evidence.  Martin is nauseated.  
    
      
    
    SPARE BEDROOM  
    
    (Niles, LIlith)  
    
      
    
    Niles is stretched prone on the bed, frantically working the video game
    control as Lilith knocks and comes into the room.  Now it's Niles's
    turn to get nervous as Lilith sits down on the bed to discuss an
    attraction of a personal nature.  But as Lilith recites her evidence
    for the idea that Frasier is trying to get back together with her, Niles
    tells her it's just her own ego causing her to think so.  Lilith
    agrees to watch for more conclusive evidence.  
    
      
    
    HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT  
    
    (Frasier, Martin)  
    
      
    
    Frasier asks his father to come back into the apartment and assess the
    situation, letting Frasier know in a subtle way what he thinks about
    it.  Martin agrees.  
    
      
    
    LIVING ROOM  
    
    (Frederick, Martin, Frasier, Lilith)  
    
      
    
    Frederick lights candles and turns on soft music to set a romantic
    atmosphere.  He turns down the lights and exits to his 
    bedroom.  
    
      
    
    Frasier enters to find his apartment set up for a romantic evening. 
    He panics and runs into the kitchen.    
    
      
    
    Lilith comes in from the bedroom and is chagrined to find the atmosphere
    completely changed.  Just then Frasier enters the room.  
    
      
    
    Martin comes in, takes one look and starts talking about the new trick
    he's teaching Eddie.  It's called, "Run for your
    life!"  Having delivered his message loud and clear, he
    leaves.  
    
      
    
    Lilith and Frasier confront each other, each denying setting up the
    romantic trap.  Finally Frasier adds the clues -- Frederick is
    setting them up.  But why?  Lilith provides the answer. 
    Frederick hopes that when they realize he wants them together, and they
    have to disappoint him, they will feel so guilty that they will buy him
    the mini-bike he's been wanting.  Frasier is unsure that Frederick
    could be so deviousl, but Lilith is convinced and calls Frederick in from
    the bedroom, asking Frasier to cooperate with her plan.  
    
      
    
    Frederick arrives and Lilith tells him and a stunned Frasier that
    Frederick's wish is about to come true: Frasier and Lilith are getting
    remarried.  Freddie is ecstatic and runs off to tell Niles.  
    
      
    
    Lilith remarks that Frederick is cooler at this charade than she thought,
    but Frasier is unwilling to lie to him any further.  He berates
    Lilith for her deviousness as she sticks to her guns.  
    
      
    
    Niles reappears with Frederick, teeth gritted and seeking confirmation of
    the happy news.  Lilith provides it, and Niles is so overjoyed that
    he walks abruptly out the door without his suit jacket or his coat. 
    Freddie runs off to telephone his friends.  
    
      
    
    Frasier tells Lilith that they have just obliterated all of Frederick's
    trust in them by lying to him.  Lilith isn't convinced, and pushes a
    button on the telephone to listen in on Frederick's conversation in the
    bedroom.  Sure enough, Frederick is assuring one of his friends that
    he will soon be the proud owner of a mini-bike.  His joy is
    short-lived as Lilith announces their presence with a stern,
    "Frederick!"  Frederick hastily hangs up the phone.  
    
      
    
    Frasier shakes his head in admiration at Lilith's cleverness as they
    agree that they haven't done such a bad job of parenting after all. 
    Their son's attempt at manipulation proves just one thing -- that he's a
    completely normal boy who won't hesitate to put his parents through hell
    to get what he wants.  They congratulate each other and sit down to
    sip some wine, letting Frederick twist in the wind a bit longer and
    wonder what his punishment will be.

    Daphne kneels next to Frederick on the bed as he pretends to struggle
    with the video game.  Finally she takes pity on him and puts her
    arms around his to help him work the controls.  Frederick looks at
    her with a rather Niles-like expression of satisfaction as at least one
    plan works out for the day.
