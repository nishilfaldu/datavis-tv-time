    _Act One
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa
    Daphne is sat at a table as Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne!
     **Daphne:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Hello, I thought you were spending the afternoon with Dad.
     **Daphne:** He's in the loo.  Why don't you join us?
    **Frasier:** All right, thank you. [_sits_] Hey, did you happen to catch the 
             show today?  I was on fire.  First caller was an agoraphobic -- 
             [_fists the air_] Boom! - knocked it right out of the park.  
             Then, two troubled marriages and a compulsive over-eater -- 
             Boom-boom, Boom!  I was a regular mental health dispensing 
             machine.
     **Daphne:** I did two loads of laundry and cut a piece of gum out of 
             Eddie's hair.
    **Frasier:** Now, Daphne, don't get down on yourself.  The work you do at 
             home is very important.  In fact, I don't know what Dad and 
             I are going to do once you're married.
     **Daphne:** Thank you, Dr. Crane, that makes me feel better.
    **Frasier:** Boom!  Boy, there is no off-switch on this thing!
     **Daphne:** Sadly, that's true. [_laughs_]
    
    _Roz enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, there she is, the other half of our team.  Roz, are you 
             still as jazzed as I am?
        **Roz:** They're taking us off the air! [_sits_]
    **Frasier:** What?!  Since when?
        **Roz:** Well, while you were out looking for Gatorade to pour over 
             yourself, Kenny came by and said he's yanking us for a week. 
             He wants to try out that new show - you know, "Car Chat with 
             Bob and Bethany."
    **Frasier:** "Car Chat with Bob and Bethany," what the... [_pauses_] Ohhh, 
             touche, Kenny.  You are indeed a worthy adversary but you 
             shall find I have a trick or two of my own! [_laughs_]
     **Daphne:** You know, Dr. Crane, maybe a week off would do you some good.
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, you don't understand.  See, I'm actually 
             renegotiating my contract right now, this is merely 
             the station's tactic to try and get me to cave.
        **Roz:** Well, I hope you're right.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course I'm right; Bob and Bethany, Car chat, please!  
             I mean how can anyone drone on for three hours about a subject 
             that nobody even understands! 
        **Roz:** Yeah!  We were there first!
    
    _Roz goes to the counter._
    
     **Daphne:** Don't worry, Dr. Crane, I'm sure you're right about these 
             things.  After all, you usually are.
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you, Daphne, that's exactly what I needed to hear.
     **Daphne:** Boom!
    
    _They laugh as Martin enters from the toilets._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi Dad.
     **Martin:**[_sits_] Boy, they really did a job in the men's room, didn't 
             they? 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I hadn't noticed.
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, completely re-did it: Fancy wallpapers, bright new 
             tiles, even those little perfumed soaps that you like to use 
             at home, Fras.
     **Daphne:** Oh, for heaven's sakes, you went into the ladies room, you 
             blind old sod!  I've been begging him for months to get 
             glasses.
     **Martin:** Ladies room?!  You're crazy, that guy was just in there.
    
    _Martin points out a very masculine-looking woman._
    
    **Frasier:**[_calls over to the woman_] Oh hi, Bethany.  Listen, good luck 
             in the slot next week.
    **Bethany:** Thanks, we're pumped. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Granted, Dad, Bethany may be a bit of a tough call, but still, 
             you know, it wouldn't hurt to get a check-up.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, don't you start too.  There's nothing wrong with 
             my eyes. [_picks up cream holder_] Now, if you don't mind, I 
             just want to sit here quietly and have a... [_notices the cup 
             he picked up_] ...have a drink of cream, do you have a problem 
             with that?!  Good.
    
    _The rest look at him as he sips the cream.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment
    Daphne is cutting some coupons as Frasier enters._
    
     **Daphne:** Hi, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Daphne.  Say, you know my agent, Bebe, said she 
             might be stopping by.  Have you heard anything?
     **Daphne:** No, and I hope she's not staying for lunch, I'm afraid we're 
             fresh out of live mice.
    
    _Martin then enters wearing a pair of "old-woman" glasses.  Frasier 
    looks at him, alarmed._
    
     **Martin:** Hi, Fras. 
    **Frasier:** Dad.
    
    _Martin proudly exits to the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Is it my imagination or are those ladies' glasses?
     **Daphne:** Yes, but don't you say anything.  I had to drag him down to 
             the store.  He tried on every pair in the place, those were 
             the only ones he liked. 
     **Martin:**[_enters_] So, how do you like the new specs?
    **Frasier:** They certainly are eye-catching.
     **Martin:** Yeah.  You should have seen the looks I got all day.  Mostly 
             from women.  You know, I'd like to think it was me but I've 
             got an idea that these frames were designed with an eye to 
             pleasing the ladies.
    **Frasier:** I'd say that's a safe assumption. [_laughs with Daphne_]
     **Martin:** Have you seen the case for them?  I don't know what I did 
             with it.
     **Daphne:** Yes, I think I popped them into my purse, check my room.
     **Martin:** Okey-doke.  Oh, wait till you see this case, Fras.  This 
             Loren guy really knows what he's doing. [_exits to Daphne's 
             room_]
    **Frasier:** Ralph Lauren?
     **Daphne:** Sophia. [_giggles_]
    **Frasier:** I'm amazed you could keep a straight face all day.
     **Daphne:** Well, I've done enough clothes shopping with your father. 
             [_doorbell sounds_] I'm pretty good at pretending to like 
             things, no matter how horrifying I find them.
    
    _Daphne opens the door and smiles at Bebe._
    
     **Daphne:**[_cheerful pretense_] Bebe, how nice to see you. 
    
    _Bebe peremptorily hands her coat to Daphne and enters.  
    Daphne goes to hang it up and then exits._
    
       **Bebe:** Frasier, my favorite client, Seattle's golden-throated gift 
             to the airwaves.
    **Frasier:**[_kissing her cheeks_] So, I take it negotiations aren't going 
             so well?
       **Bebe:** You remember that insulting figure you said you'd never 
             accept?  
    **Frasier:** Uh-huh.
       **Bebe:** They haven't come up to it yet.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear. 
      **Niles:**[_at open door_] Knock, knock.
    **Frasier:** Oh, come on in, Niles.  Bebe's just bringing me up to speed 
             on her depressing news about my contract negotiations.
       **Bebe:** Don't worry, dear, I just need to find a way to throw a scare 
             into 'em.
      **Niles:** Have you tried turning into a bat?
       **Bebe:** I would, love, but most grown men don't share your fear of 
             tiny creatures! 
    **Frasier:** Could you two please catch up later?
       **Bebe:** I did get one offer that I thought might give us some leverage.  
             It's a TV job.
    **Frasier:** Television?
       **Bebe:** Unfortunately it's all wrong for you.  They want you and Roz 
             to host "AM Seattle" next week.
      **Niles:** That vapid morning chat show?
       **Bebe:** Exactly what I told them.  Frasier Crane is a doctor!  
             He heals the masses, he doesn't pander to them.  He's 
             not going to do some silly morning kaffeeklatch, no matter 
             how fabulously popular it is.
    **Frasier:** No, it's quite right, Bebe.  That sort of show, it's beneath 
             me.
       **Bebe:** Exactly.
    **Frasier:** It's undignified.
       **Bebe:** Horribly.
    **Frasier:** Still...
       **Bebe:** I'm listening.
    **Frasier:** If there were a way to do it with a bit more dignity, some 
             polish and substance...
       **Bebe:** Why didn't I think of that?
    **Frasier:** You know, a dash of high society, a dollop of culture...
      **Niles:** I can't believe you're even considering this.  The show is 
             nothing more than a melange of bad jokes and mind-numbing 
             banter.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it doesn't have to be, Niles, don't you see?  I 
             mean, if I could choose the guests myself-
       **Bebe:** You can.
    **Frasier:** And control the content-
       **Bebe:** You could.
    **Frasier:** Well, then, I'd accept.
       **Bebe:** We did. [_realizes_] I mean, we will.  In fact, why don't I 
             call them right now with the exciting news. [_takes out phone 
             and a cigarette_] May I?
    **Frasier:** On the balcony, if you don't mind.
       **Bebe:** Mind?  I don't want a single puff tearing up the baby blues 
             of TV's newest sensation.  By this time next week...
      **Niles:** You heard him, if you're gonna blow smoke, do it on the 
             balcony.
    
    _Bebe looks daggers at Niles, then haughtily puts the cigarette 
    between her lips and exits to the balcony._
    
      **Niles:** Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
    **Frasier:** What is that supposed to mean?
      **Niles:** Only that something like this was inevitable.  It's the final 
             step in your descent from legitimate psychiatrist to dancing 
             bear.
    **Frasier:** Niles, we are talking about doing a sophisticated television 
             show for one week in order to improve my contract negotiations.
      **Niles:** This has nothing to do with your contract negotiations!  You 
             have been an applause junky ever since you first set foot on
             a grammar school stage.
    **Frasier:** I was drawn to the theatre because of its discipline and 
             collaborative spirit!
      **Niles:** Oh please, in your sixth grade production of "Oklahoma!" 
             you took so many curtain calls, Mrs. Van Raphorst had to 
             lasso you and pull you from the stage!
    **Frasier:** That woman never understood me or the role of Farmer Number 
             Three!
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm just wasting my breath.  As usual you have fallen 
             under the spell of that sorceress out there.
    **Frasier:** I have done no such thing.  I wish you would just lay off of 
             Bebe.  You know, she is not some malign witch who can transform 
             people at will!
    
    _Martin enters wearing his glasses and searching through Daphne's 
    purse which is hung on his arm._
    
     **Martin:** I can't find a damn thing in this purse! [_exits_]
      **Niles:** If I say I'm sorry, will she change Dad back into a man?
    
    _Frasier gives Niles a look.
    
    End of Act One
    
    Act Two
    
    Scene One - TV Studio
    Frasier arrives with Bebe on the stage.  The producer, Matt, is 
    standing by.  Some stage hands and makeup artists circle around
    Frasier, putting the final touches on his look._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, it took several of your best people, but I believe 
             they have finally wrestled this feisty cow-lick of mine 
             into submission.  So, are we ready to roll?
       **Matt:** Not quite, your partner's not here.
    **Frasier:** Roz is not here?  But we're on in four minutes.
       **Matt:** No, at this point a re-run is on in four minutes.
       **Bebe:** Don't worry, Matt, she'll be here.
       **Matt:** We won't even have time to put her through make-up.
       **Bebe:** A natural beauty like Roz?  Oh, please, darling, pinch her 
             cheeks, stand back and watch her glow.
    
    _Roz enters - she looks rather under the weather._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, sorry I'm late.
    **Frasier:** Roz, oh for God's sakes, you look awful, are you sick?
        **Roz:** No, of course not, I wouldn't be sick for our big debut.  
             I'm totally fine.
    **Frasier:**[_feels her forehead_] Roz, you're burning up!
        **Roz:** Well, it's kinda hot in here, maybe it's all these lights. 
             Let me just get this jacket off!
    
    _Roz begins to unbutton her shirt until Frasier stops her._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no, Roz, stop, stop!
       **Matt:** She's delirious!
       **Bebe:** With anticipation, darling.  Don't worry, I'll calm her down.
    
    _Bebe takes Roz to the side and shakes her._
    
       **Bebe:** Pull yourself together, do you hear me?!  We need this show!
       **Matt:** All right, everyone, we're doing a re-run, let the audience go, 
             cue the tapes.
       **Bebe:** Wait?  Can't Frasier do the show without her?
       **Matt:** This is a chat show, who's he going to chat with?
       **Bebe:** Me, I'll go on with him.
    **Frasier:** You? [_shakes Roz_] Pull yourself together, Roz!
       **Matt:** I don't think so, Bebe.
       **Bebe:** Why not?  All he needs is someone to suck up to him, laugh at 
             his jokes, pretend to listen to his stories.  I'm his agent, 
             for God's sakes, that's what I do!
    **Frasier:** You know, I believe she could pull it off.
       **Matt:** The problem is she needs to be likable.
    **Frasier:** Right.  Do I at least get to keep the suit?
       **Bebe:** Hold on, I can be likable.  I can also be very _un_ -likable. 
             Maybe if you explained the difference to poor confused Bebe. 
             For instance, what you were doing in the dressing room with 
             the wardrobe girl an hour ago - would your wife find that 
             likable or unlikable?
       **Matt:**[_worried_] Could you put some make-up on this woman?
    
    _Bebe walks over to Frasier._
    
    **Manager:** Okay, folks, sixty seconds.
    **Frasier:** All right, Bebe, just follow my lead.  I'll introduce us and 
             then I'll get to our guests, all right? 
    
    _They sit and Frasier looks through the cue cards._
    
    **Frasier:** Wasn't our first guest Susan Sontag?
       **Bebe:** She had a conflict.  Don't worry, we've got a fabulous 
             replacement.
    **Frasier:**[_reading_] "Baby Leo, the world's biggest two year-old"?!
       **Bebe:** You're gonna love him.  Just remember to lift with your legs.
    **Frasier:**[_throws down the cards_] That's it, this is unacceptable.
       **Bebe:** Ohhh, now who's the world's biggest baby?
    **Frasier:** Bebe, I will not do this show...!
    **Manager:**[_over Frasier's protests_] And we're on in five, four...
    _Frasier and Bebe cease their arguing as the intro music starts and the 
    audience applauds._
    
    **Frasier:** Hi, welcome to "AM Seattle."  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
       **Bebe:** And I'm Bebe Glaser.
    **Frasier:** We're gonna be your hosts this week and believe me, we've 
             got some great shows lined up for you.  But before we get to 
             our guests I'd like to take a few moments to share with you 
             a few thoughts I've prepared on a very special time of the 
             day, the time that we'll be spending together, morning.  A 
             new beginning.  A daily rebirth, if you will.
       **Matt:** What the hell is this?  Banter, banter. [_he mimes banter to 
             Bebe_]
    **Frasier:** And even though AM stands for Anti-Meridian, if you simply 
             put them together, they also make up the word "am" as in "I 
             am." 
       **Bebe:** Whoa!  Not before my coffee!  As you can see, Frasier has a 
             way with words, but did you also know that he has a way with 
             voices.
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?  
       **Bebe:** Who wants to hear Frasier's famous Sean Connery impression?
    
    _The crowd goes wild._
    
    [_N.B. They used the real studio audience that attended the filming of 
    this episode._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_Sean Connery voice_] Now, Now, Moneypenny, you're 
             embarrassing me.
       **Bebe:** Dr. Frasier Crane, ladies and gentlemen.  Anymore 
             impressions, Frasier? 
    **Frasier:** You know what, maybe I should just get back to my...
       **Bebe:** Now, don't be shy!  Who wants to hear Frasier do more 
             impressions?
    
    _The crowd applauds._
    
    **Frasier:** It's just that I'd hate to take time away from our other 
             guests.  I believe that [_in James Mason voice_] James Mason 
             may be stopping by to visit.
    
    _The crowd applauds as we FADE OUT._
    
    **I THINK THAT SMELL IS GREASE PAINT**
    
    _Scene Two - TV Studio
    A few days later, Bebe and Frasier are presenting another show_
    
    **Frasier:** Well, this has been some week.
       **Bebe:** It's really flown by.
    **Frasier:** Hasn't it?
       **Bebe:** Whoosh!
    **Frasier:** A-whoosh!
       **Bebe:** And there's even time for Thursday's kitchen corner.  We'll 
             be right back with Chef Frasier.
    
    _They take the show to commercials._
    
        **Matt:** And we're clear.
     **Frasier:** Bebe, "Kitchen corner?"  I thought we had the violin prodigy 
              up next.  For God sakes, we've bumped Kim Lee twice this 
              week.
        **Bebe:** I know, but we're running short of time and the cooking 
              segment's going to be bopo!
     **Frasier:** Well, all right, but I insist Kim Lee play over the closing 
              credits, all right?  We're not running some sort of tacky, 
              run-of-the-mill morning show!
    Director: Here's your chef's costume. [_he takes it in anguish_]
        **Bebe:** Now, now, big dear.  You know, Frasier, the most magical 
              thing happened to me last night during dinner.
     **Frasier:** Really?
        **Bebe:** I was recognized.
     **Frasier:** Intoxicating, isn't it?  Gosh, I myself, no stranger 
              to celebrity, have noticed more heads swiveling in my 
              direction. 
        **Matt:** And we're back in five, four, three, two...
    
    _Frasier and Bebe take their place._
    
    **Frasier:** Welcome back.
       **Bebe:** Frasier, I hear you're quite the gourmet.
    **Frasier:** Oh please, I don't do anything fancy.  A few souffles, a 
             flambe or two, just good eats!  Now, this morning I'm going 
             to be making my signature breakfast for you.  That's "Eggs 
             Pelemo Fontana."
       **Bebe:** Mmmm, makes my mouth water.  But before we start, I have a 
             little sweetheart backstage who's dying to come out and give 
             you a hand.
    **Frasier:** Is it Kim Lee?
       **Bebe:** Not even close.  It's Bobo, the cooking chimp!
    
    _A stagehand leads in Bobo, wearing a chef's jacket._
    
    **Frasier:**[_covering_] Ho-ho, that's very funny, it is.  This has Matt's 
             fingerprints all over it!
    
    _Offstage, Matt points at Frasier, grinning._
    
       **Bebe:** We thought it might be great fun if you were to match your 
             skills against him.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know, Bebe.  Er....
       **Bebe:** Well, let's let the audience decide.  How many of you want to 
             see the monkey make eggs? [_they all clap_] Now, how many of 
             you want to see Bobo make eggs? 
    **Frasier:** Ouch! [_laughs_] Well, all right, apes before beauty! 
    
    _Bobo and Frasier take their seat in the kitchen corner._
    
       **Bebe:** Frasier, Bobo, may the best chef win!
    **Frasier:** Now, the first rule of boute cusine is to be sure that you 
             have all of your ingredients at hand.  You see, we have eggs, 
             milk, butter, spinach and of course our old friend, the 
             shallot!
    
    _Bobo meanwhile has already cracked his egg in the pan._
    
    **Frasier:** Why, look at that, he's not even pre-heating the pan, the 
             beast! [_laughs_]
       **Bebe:** Bobo's getting an early lead.
    **Frasier:** It's very important to keep your eggs light and fluffy, so 
             what you want to do is add a bit of milk and a touch of 
             flour.
    
    _Bobo meanwhile throws an egg at Frasier.  They begin to have an 
    improvised slinging match, throwing the eggs at each other.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment
    That evening, Frasier, Daphne and Martin (wearing his women's glasses) 
    are watching it on the television._
    
    **Frasier:** Now this whole thing was improvised.
     **Daphne:** You're kidding, it's like you and the chimp have been 
             working together for years!
     **Martin:** Boy, that's great stuff, Frasier.  You know, I can't tell you 
             how impressed the guys at McGinty's are that I have such a 
             famous son.
    **Frasier:** Really?  What do they say?
     **Martin:** Well, they don't say anything to my face, but when I walk in 
             they kind of nudge each other and whisper.
     **Daphne:**[_responding to a bell heard in the kitchen_] That'll be my 
             Shepherd's Pie. [_exits to kitchen_]
     **Martin:** Shepherd's Pie? [_takes glasses off_]
    **Frasier:** You know, I must confess, there's a part of me that wishes I 
             could still do the TV show. [_doorbell_]
     **Martin:** Well, there's a part of me that wishes that monkey was 
             cooking dinner instead of you-know-who... but we put our
             dreams away!
    
    _Martin exits as Frasier opens the door to Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Roz.  Well, don't you look nice.  Are you feeling 
             better?
        **Roz:** Yes, thank you.  Can we talk?
    **Frasier:** Well, of course, come on in.  What's the matter?
        **Roz:** Well, I talked to my friends in business affairs and they say 
             they're ready to close our deal but Bebe's holding it up.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course she's holding it up, she's trying to make 
             them sweat a little bit.  That's the whole strategy behind 
             the TV show: leverage.
        **Roz:** Yeah, well, I heard a rumor that "AM Seattle" isn't happy 
             with their regular hosts and I think she's angling for you 
             to take over.  So where does that leave me?
    **Frasier:** Well, even if that was Bebe's plan, you're forgetting that 
             it's still my career and I'm calling the shots.  There is 
             no way I would continue doing "AM Seattle."
        **Roz:** Yeah, well, you look like you are having the time of your 
             life.
    **Frasier:** I'm playing a character!  There is a big difference between 
             "Dr. Frasier Crane, psychiatrist" and "Frasier Crane, the 
             guy who starts your morning right."  I'll tell you what.  
             I will speak to Bebe when we're in the chair.  Oh, that's 
             the industry term for when we're getting our make-up put on.
        **Roz:** Thanks, Frasier. [_picks up Martin's glasses_] God, this is so 
             weird!  Daphne usually has such great taste, what was she 
             thinking with these glasses?!
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, Roz...
        **Roz:**[_laughing, puts them on_] I've gotta go see what these look 
             like.
    
    _Roz heads to the powder room as Martin enters and notices her._
    
     **Martin:** Hi, Roz. 
        **Roz:** Hey. [_she closes the door_] 
     **Martin:** He-he-he, somebody ought to tell Mr. Doyle she's wearing 
             a dude's glasses!
    
    _Frasier rolls his eyes.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Backstage
    Behind the scenes of "AM Seattle," Frasier is getting his make-up put 
    on as Bebe enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Kiki, you're a magician. 
       **Bebe:** Frasier, you're not going to believe the wonderful news I 
             just got: they want us to stay on.
    **Frasier:** What?!
       **Bebe:** Yes, we had the highest ratings the show's had all year. 
    **Frasier:** I don't believe this, Roz was right.  You had no intention 
             of negotiating my radio contract. 
       **Bebe:**...I don't expect gratitude, Frasier.  Just a little faith.  
             I finished your KACL contract this morning. [_hands it over_]
    **Frasier:** You did?
       **Bebe:** And I did quite a good job, I might add.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry, Bebe, I owe you an apology... [_reads it_] 
             Well, this is wonderful, got an extra week's vacation and 
             a very handsome raise.
       **Bebe:** It's garbage compared to what they'll give us to stay on here.  
             You'll get an expense account, a wardrobe allowance, not to 
             mention a car and driver.
    
    _For a moment he's tempted._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no, let's not forget why I took this job.  It was to raise 
             my profile, to get a better deal with the radio contract, and 
             we've done that, Bebe.  And I thank you.
       **Bebe:** You're welcome, darling, and I respect your choice.
    **Frasier:** Thanks.
       **Bebe:** Now, let's talk about today's show.
    **Frasier:** Right.
       **Bebe:** We start with the Friday Fiesta, here are our costumes... 
             [_hands over Mexican ponchos_] and then we move on to the Girl 
             Scout cookie-selling champ... [_Bebe turns to tears_] and then 
             we... 
    **Frasier:** Bebe, are you all right?
       **Bebe:** I spent my life in the wings, it was just nice having my 
             moment in the spotlight.  The rush when that little red light 
             on camera turns on... [_captivating him_] The stupid masking 
             tape on that dressing room door with my name on it...
    **Frasier:** The stage door johnnys, or whatever that strange man with the 
             autograph book calls himself...
    
    _Niles enters, noticing her tactics._
    
       **Bebe:** Admit it, darling, you want this as much as I do.  I saw it 
             in your eyes during the pie-eating contest.  Nobody loves 
             blueberries that much, it's the audience you love!
    
    **Announcer:**[_o.s._] Are you ready for Bebe and Frasier?
    
    _The crowd goes wild.  Bebe clutches Frasier._
    
       **Bebe:** Listen to them!  They want you!
    **Frasier:** They do want me, don't they?
       **Bebe:** Tell me to tear up the contract, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Maybe it is time for a change...
      **Niles:**[_moves in_] Get away from him, you she-thing!  
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** It's a good thing Dad started choking on that peanut or I 
             would have never come back here for water.  Stop this madness!
       **Bebe:** He can't stop it, no one can, show business is in his blood!
      **Niles:** No, psychiatry is.  Frasier, you're a healer.
       **Bebe:** Anyone can heal.  You're better than that, [_eyes light up_] 
             you're an entertainer!
    **Frasier:** Oh God, Niles, she's right.  I love the audience.  I know it's 
             shallow but it makes me feel alive.
      **Niles:** Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look in this outfit? 
             Frasier, I know I sometimes I make light of your radio show, 
             but the truth is you provide help and hope and comfort to 
             people who need it.  I have always envied you that.
       **Bebe:** Don't listen to that drivel!
    **Frasier:** He's right, Bebe.  I'm a psychiatrist, I can't do the show 
             anymore.  I'm sorry.
       **Bebe:** Then quit!  Who needs ya?  I'll find some other stuffed 
             shirt who's happy to ride my coat tails to fame. [_beat_] Niles, 
             you're a doctor.
    **Frasier:**[_stands between them_] Niles, don't look into her eyes!
       **Bebe:** Well, that's it... the dream is over.
       **Matt:**[_o.s._] Thirty seconds!
       **Bebe:** But I'm still a professional. [_puts on her oversized sombrero_] 
             There's an audience out there waiting for two people to ride 
             in on a donkey.  I don't know about you, but I'm not going 
             to let them down. [_mounts the donkey_]
      **Niles:**[_off Frasier's glance_] It's your last show.  Get out there!
    **Frasier:** Thanks, brother, for keeping me grounded. 
    _Frasier then puts his Mexican hat on and clambers onto the donkey and 
    sets out to the stage._
    
      **Niles:**_Vaya Con Dios!_
    
    _As Frasier and Bebe emerge from the curtain, they salute the audience._
    
    **Announcer:**[_o.s._] And here they are, Bebe and Frasier!
    
    _The crowd goes wild._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Martin is sat in Cafe Nervosa cleaning his glasses. As he does so, a 
    woman comes in and sits with him wearing the exact same type. Martin 
    realizes they are ladies' glasses and quietly slips the glasses away 
    before striking up conversation with her.
