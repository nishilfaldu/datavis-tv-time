    _Act One.
    
    PROLOGUE
    [Kelsey Grammer introduces a few clips from "Back Talk," the first part 
    of this special two-parter.]
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    It's Christmas Week in Seattle.  Not only is the Space Needle supporting 
    fairy lights, but the apartment is also adorned with stylish Christmas 
    decorations.  Martin is at work on a little toy Santa when Frasier 
    enters._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Good Lord, Dad.  You've been tinkering with that thing for 
             hours.  Don't you think that maybe "Dancing Santa" could sit 
             this Christmas out?
     **Martin:** Oh, I've got to get it ready for your big party tomorrow night. 
    _The doorbell sounds.  Frasier crosses to the door._
    **Frasier:** Oh, no need, Dad.  There will be plenty of things to delight 
             my guests.  We'll be caroling and playing games.  Oh, and I'll 
             be reading "A Child's Christmas in Wales" to bring the evening 
             to a close.
     **Martin:**[_to himself_] That should do it!
    _Frasier opens the door to Roz, wrapped up for winter.  She is carrying 
    an extravagant silver punch bowl._
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey, Martin.
     **Martin:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** I can't stay, I just stopped by to drop off your punch bowl. 
    **Frasier:** Well, thank you, Roz.  Say, what kind of punch did you serve?
        **Roz:** Well, first I filled it with ice.  Then I just poured orange 
             juice and vodka over it.
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, that's just a giant screwdriver!
        **Roz:** Yeah, so?  What am I, Martha Stewart?
    **Frasier:** Fine!  Thanks anyway, I'm really going to be needing this bowl 
             tomorrow evening.  There's going to be a crowd of guests.  
             I've invited the entire building - including Cam Winston.  
     **Martin:** Oh!
    **Frasier:** In the spirit of Christmas I've decided to put an end to our 
             feud.
        **Roz:** What are you feuding about?
     **Martin:** Oh, he parks his SUV right next to Frasier's Beemer!
    **Frasier:** Yes well, that car is grotesquely oversized.  I've often been 
             forced to exit from the passenger's side.  Many a time, I've 
             been brought to grief on my gear shift! [_exits to kitchen_]
        **Roz:** Why doesn't he just back in?
     **Martin:** Are you kidding?  He can barely hit that space even when the 
             guy's car isn't there!
    _Roz smiles and heads to the door.  Daphne appears from her room._
     **Daphne:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey, Daphne. [_calls_] Bye, guys! [_they ad-lib goodbyes_]
     **Daphne:** You leaving?
        **Roz:** Yeah.
     **Daphne:** Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
    _Daphne takes Roz out into the hall and closes the door behind her._
        **Roz:** What is it?
     **Daphne:** The other day I found out something about Dr. Crane I wasn't 
             supposed to know. 
        **Roz:**[_excited_] Frasier?
     **Daphne:** No, his brother.  Apparently, he's had a crush on me for 
             years.
        **Roz:**[_exhales_] Thank God!
     **Daphne:** What do you mean, "Thank God?"
        **Roz:** I've been afraid for months I'd be the one to blow the 
             secret.
     **Daphne:** You mean you knew?
        **Roz:** Well, everybody kinda did.
     **Daphne:** And nobody said anything?
        **Roz:** Well, if Niles wasn't ready to say anything, it wasn't our 
             place to do it.  Well, who spilt the beans?  It was Frasier, 
             wasn't it?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, but he doesn't know he told me.
        **Roz:** He doesn't?
     **Daphne:** Well, he was on those painkillers for his back and, well, 
             I can't very well discuss it with Dr. Crane, he's so close 
             to Dr. Crane, if I told him he might tell Dr. Crane and then 
             Dr. Crane might feel embarrassed.
        **Roz:** Yeah, why confuse things?
     **Daphne:** The whole thing's just a bit awkward. 
        **Roz:** I don't see why.  Niles has a girlfriend now, so obviously 
             he's gotten over you, and you're engaged to Donny. 
     **Daphne:** I suppose when you look at it like that there's really no 
             reason to feel awkward.
    _The elevator doors then open to reveal Niles who steps into the 
    corridor with some books.  Daphne becomes very nervous and looks 
    away from him._
      **Niles:** Well, there's a Christmas tableau: "Naughty & Nice." 
    _Roz fakes a smile and steps onto the elevator._
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** I'd see you inside but... I just have to... [_excuses_] Take 
             out the garbage! [_Niles looks confused_] It's in my pocket. 
    _Daphne rushes onto the elevator with Roz as Niles enters the 
    apartment and greets his brother and father._
      **Niles:** Frasier, I brought those caroling books you asked for.
    **Frasier:**[_takes them_] Thank you so much.  Yes, here we are.  "The First 
             Songs From A Victorian Christmas" and "Elizabethan Tidings of 
             Joy."  Now we're ready to party!  Niles, what do you think?  
             Should we start with the caroling or should we hold off until 
             we've played a spirited game of "The Minister's Cat?"
      **Niles:** Start with the game, then the caroling, then perhaps the 
             guests will be ready for another game.
     **Martin:** Yeah, Russian Roulette!
      **Niles:**[_looks at watch_] So, I'm off.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, if you're not busy this evening, perhaps you 
             could help me string popcorn garlands. 
      **Niles:** Ah, unfortunately, I have to see Maris tonight.
     **Martin:** Maris?!  What the hell do you have to see her for?
      **Niles:** Sadly, to pay my condolences.  It seems our old gardener has 
             passed away unexpectedly. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, not Yoshi.  Gosh, that's too bad. 
      **Niles:** He had a heart attack when he was out trimming Maris's 
             elaborate hedge maze.  The paramedics never had a chance.
     **Martin:** Well, I feel bad about Yoshi, but are you sure it's a good 
             idea spending the evening with Maris?
      **Niles:** Well, she's terribly upset.  Maris and Yoshi were very close. 
             In fact I remember he once made a topiary likeness of her 
             and wept without shame when it developed root rot.  Well, the 
             problem is, I had to cancel on Mel tonight.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  Well, Niles, if you want my advice, I wouldn't 
             mention Maris to Mel.
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** The last thing a new girlfriend wants to hear is that you're 
             consoling your ex-wife.
      **Niles:** Well, I hate to lie to Mel.  Though I do see your point, 
             Frasier.
     **Martin:** Ha-hey!  There he goes!
    _The "Dancing Santa" springs to life, to Martin's joy.  It begins 
    wiggling its hips from side to side, dancing to music.  Niles and 
    Frasier are horrified._
      **Niles:**[_putting on a joyful facade_] Dad!  Santa's back!
     **Martin:** Yeah!  It's the darndest thing, every year when I take him out 
             of the box, something's wrong with it.  But I always manage to 
             fix him again.
      **Niles:** Good for you, Dad. [_to Frasier, sotto voce_] I told you to dunk 
             it underwater.
    **Frasier:** I did!
    _Niles exits as Frasier looks concerned at the grotesque figurine.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **ANYONE FOR A HOT BUTTERED MARGARITA?**
    _Scene Two - KACL Foyer
    It is the office Christmas party.  The foyer is decorated for 
    Christmas, Mexican style.  Even the food has the taste of Mexico. 
    Frasier is nibbling as Kenny approaches._
      **Kenny:** Hey Doc.  Merry Christmas.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Kenny.  My, the station has certainly outdone itself this 
             year with the Christmas in _Mexico_ theme. 
      **Kenny:** It was my idea.  It hit me when I realized their sauces are 
             red and green.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Well, that's why you're the boss.
    _Kenny drifts off as Roz approaches him._
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier, what time's your party tonight?
    **Frasier:**[_quiets her_] Please keep your voice down, you're the only one 
             from the station I've invited.
        **Roz:** The only one?!
    **Frasier:** Yes, but don't worry, there'll be scads of people, because 
             I invited everyone in my building.  Seven o'clock!
    _Roz goes off to mingle as Gil arrives with some macho gingerbread men._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Gil, Merry Christmas.
        **Gil:** And to you, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you.
        **Gil:** I hope you've saved room for dessert.
    **Frasier:** Have you been baking?
        **Gil:** I have!  Gingerbread men.
    **Frasier:** Oh my, [_looks_] don't they look... muscular!
        **Gil:** Yes well, my wife and I made a New Year's Resolution; Deb 
             and I have joined a gym to slim down and buff up.  We needed 
             these to inspire us.
    **Frasier:** Ah yes, there's nothing to strengthen a dieter's resolve like 
             a good motivational pastry.
        **Gil:** Precisely.  The problem is they're so delicious, I've already 
             had three. [_picks one up_] This is my last little man, I 
             promise. [_starts to eat him_] Oh, Gil, who are you kidding? 
             [_wanders off_]
    **Frasier:**[_aside_] No one, Gil.
    _Then Mel, Niles's girlfriend, approaches him._
        **Mel:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Mel.
        **Mel:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Well, gosh, I never expected to see you here.
        **Mel:** Oh, well, I was one of the doctors on "Health Chat" during 
             cosmetic surgery week.  I did a segment on breast augmentation.
    **Frasier:** Ah, how uplifting! [_laughs but Mel doesn't find it funny_]
        **Mel:** Yes well, Niles is hanging up our coats.  So did you two have 
             a good dinner last night?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, actually we didn't have dinner last night, I was 
             too busy planning my party.  But please don't mention it to 
             any of my colleagues, they're not invited...
    _However, when Frasier turns around Mel has disappeared to find Niles._
    **Frasier:** Mel?
      **Niles:**[_arrives_] Frasier, Frasier, glad I saw you.  About last night, 
             if Mel should ask...
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.
      **Niles:** Oh, no.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.
      **Niles:** And you...?
    **Frasier:** I'm afraid so.
      **Niles:** Damn you!  Well, you're the one who told me to lie to her and 
             now you fail to back me up! 
    _Niles hits him on the shoulder -- well, "hit" being used loosely -- and 
    then goes to find Mel.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_shouts after him_] Well, I'm a little preoccupied, I'm having  
             a party tonight for two hundred people! 
    _Kenny is walking past and hears this.  He looks upset and Frasier looks 
    guilty._
      **Kenny:** Well, I won't lie to you, Doc.  This hurts!
    _Meanwhile, Niles tries to reason with Mel, who has already put on
    her coat to leave._
      **Niles:** Mel, Mel, darling, please, quick, quick come here, sweetheart.
        **Mel:** Niles-
      **Niles:** I know you're upset, darling, but...
        **Mel:** Please, we're at a party.
      **Niles:** All right, you're right, we'll talk about it later.
        **Mel:** No, we'll talk about it now.  Just put on your party face. 
    _They both put on permanent grins._
        **Mel:** Don't embarrass me - as if I could be further embarrassed 
             after you lied to me.
      **Niles:** I can explain.
        **Mel:** No, no, no, you don't need to.  When a man lies about where 
             he's been, it's not hard to guess the reason.  So what's the 
             little whore's name?
      **Niles:**[_laughs to cover_] No, no, darling.  The reason I told you that 
             I was dining with Frasier was actually, I was out...
        **Mel:** Yes?
      **Niles:** Getting your Christmas present.
        **Mel:**[_covers her mouth with embarrassment and happiness_] My 
             present!  Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.  I should have known.
      **Niles:** I'm so glad you're forgiving me.  Or is that your party face?
        **Mel:** No, of course not. [_kisses him_] Why don't you hang my coat 
             back up and I'll get us something to drink?
      **Niles:** Of course.
    _Niles does as Mel wanders over to Frasier at the punch bowl and pours 
    a drink._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Mel, this is awkward.
        **Mel:** Oh, no, no, no, Frasier.  Niles explained everything and 
             while I don't like being lied to, I do appreciate why he did 
             it.
      **Niles:**[_runs over, worried_] Ooh, hello!  Hello, chatting, are we?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually I was just apologizing for my part in your 
             little misunderstanding.
      **Niles:** Well, then of course you were discussing the present.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, the present. [_lifts glass_] And the future, Maris is 
             all in the past!
        **Mel:**[_sharply_] Maris?
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.
        **Mel:** You were with Maris last night?
      **Niles:** Well...
        **Mel:** How _dare_ you?! [_leaves to coat stand_]
      **Niles:**[_to Frasier_] Anything else in the box, Pandora?
    _Niles tries to again to win back Mel.  Roz is standing just behind 
    them._
      **Niles:** Mel, please.
        **Mel:** Don't touch me, no.
      **Niles:** Party face, party face.
        **Mel:** Forget the party face.  You're obviously still in love with 
             you and I'm not about to share you.  Goodbye. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, I'm so sorry.
      **Niles:** Frasier, don't pretend to be sorry.  All you care about is 
             your precious party that you're hosting tonight!
    _Niles exits as the room falls silent and everyone else looks at Frasier, 
    upset that they're not invited.  Frasier slowly inches out of the 
    foyer.

    To
    Frasier Crane's Holiday Fest
    Elliot Bay Towers #1901
    Regrets Only
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier is pouring out some punch as Daphne and Donny fool around on 
    the piano.  Donny is playing a simple, one fingered version of "Jingle 
    Bells."_
      **Donny:** Don't be nervous, honey. 
    _They are building up to Daphne's bit..._
      **Donny:** Bring it home, Daphne!
    _Which is a chord as a finale._
      **Donny:** Daphne Moon, everybody!  We'll take your requests.
     **Martin:**[_entering from kitchen_] How about a little "Silent Night"? 
    _Martin begins to start on the appetizers._
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop that!
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** Those are for the party.
     **Martin:**[_looks around_] In case you haven't noticed: I am the party.
      **Donny:** Didn't the invitation say it was for seven o'clock?
     **Daphne:** I hope people knew it was for tonight.
    **Frasier:** Stop worrying, they'll be here.  They're probably just 
             fashionably late.  People do love to make an entrance, 
             you know.
    _The doorbell sounds._
    **Frasier:** A-ha!  Daphne, open the floodgates!
    _However, when Daphne opens the door, there stands just one very 
    miserable Niles with a bag of Christmas presents._
      **Niles:** Hello.
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane.  Isn't Mel with you?
      **Niles:** No, she won't be coming.  We broke up.
     **Daphne:**[_anxious_] What?
      **Niles:** Yup, this afternoon.
     **Daphne:** Goodness, I'm so sorry.
    **Frasier:** Did you try to call her, Niles?
      **Niles:** I left a dozen messages. 
      **Donny:** Oh, no, I'm so sorry.  How long were you guys together?
      **Niles:** Oh, no that long.  Still, I was optimistic.
      **Donny:** Did you talk about moving in together?  Make any long term 
             plans?
      **Niles:** This is really bringing out the lawyer in you, isn't it? 
             [_laughs_]
      **Donny:** The bartender, actually.  I was just wondering how big a drink 
             to make you.
      **Niles:** Ah, big!  Scotch.
    _Donny, Niles and Daphne go to the drinks table.  Donny pours him a 
    nice glassful as Frasier exits._
      **Donny:** Don't worry, Niles.  We'll fix you up with somebody.
      **Niles:** Oh, thanks Donny, I don't think this is a time for me to be 
             meeting someone new.
      **Donny:** Someone old, then.  You know, an old flame, an ex-girlfriend, 
             someone who got away.  Huh? [_Daphne looks nervous_] Come on 
             Niles, there must be somebody you had your eye on before Mel. 
     **Daphne:** Donny, please!  Can't you see you're making him uncomfortable!
    _She storms off to her room._
      **Donny:** What?  I was just trying to help, honey!  You see, Niles, it's 
             not us, it's the holidays.  It makes women crazy!
    _Meanwhile, in the hallway, Frasier has his ear to the elevator door. 
    He hears a group arriving and stands back with a gleeful expression 
    to greet them.  The doors open to reveal a packed elevator._
    **Frasier:** A-ha, hello everyone!  Come in, come in! 
    _Roz squeezes from the back and meets Frasier._
    **Frasier:** That's very nice, ladies first.  Now, no crowding, no pushing. 
             [_laughs_]
    _However, they stay inside and the doors shut._
    **Frasier:** Where are they going?
        **Roz:** I've got bad news for you.  That feud you were having with the 
             guy upstairs?  It isn't over.  He's having his own party.
    **Frasier:** Damn him!  He's siphoning off my guests. 
    _They enter the apartment._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, you won't believe this.  That dreadful Cam Winston 
             is having a competing party!
      **Donny:** Oh, that's what that was.  Some big sign in the lobby, it said 
             "Winston Party 2000."
    **Frasier:** Yes, that's his apartment number.  Well, two can play at that 
             game!  Donny!
      **Donny:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:**[_gives him paper, a pen and some scissors_] Do me a favor, 
             will you?  Make me one of those signs, see what you can 
             fashion out of these crude implements. 
      **Donny:** Okay, I'll try.
     **Martin:** I don't know whether that's a good idea, Fras.
    **Frasier:** What? 
     **Martin:** Well, "Winston Party 2000" sounds like the party of the future.  
             "Crane Party 1901" sounds like... well, this.
        **Roz:** Don't worry about it, Frasier.  You always throw a good party.  
             This place'll be hopping in no time.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Roz.
    _Roz enters the kitchen and flicks open her mobile._
        **Roz:**[_into phone_] Hey, Connie, it's a morgue here.  Is the party at 
             the station still happening?  Great, I'll be there as soon as  
             I can.
    _Daphne enters the kitchen as Roz hangs up._
        **Roz:** Oh, hey Daphne.
     **Daphne:** You're not going to believe this.  Dr. Crane broke up with 
             Mel.
        **Roz:** Oh, yeah, I know, I heard.
     **Daphne:** Is there anything you don't know before I do?
        **Roz:** I overheard them at the office Christmas party.
     **Daphne:** Really, what happened?
        **Roz:** Well, okay, don't freak out.  Mel accused Niles of still being 
             in love with someone else.
     **Daphne:** My God, that's me!  I'm someone.
        **Roz:** I said not to freak out.
     **Daphne:** But what if he says something to me?
        **Roz:** Just let him down gently.
     **Daphne:** Oh, it never works out that easily.  You know how it is when 
             you say no to a guy. 
        **Roz:**[_uncertain_] Yeah... sure.
     **Daphne:** It just gets messy after that.  You say you'll be friends, but 
             you never are.  It ruins everything.
        **Roz:** He's not going to say anything tonight.  As long as Donny's 
             here you're totally safe.
    _Meanwhile, Frasier is pushing Donny out the door with the sign._
    **Frasier:** Let's find a prominent place to put this.  Preferably right 
             on top of Winston's sign!
    _Donny exits.  Frasier turns back and sees Niles taking a long pull of 
    his glass._
    **Frasier:** Oh, go easy there, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, haven't you given me enough advice for one day?
    _The oven timer dings._
    **Frasier:** My canapes! [_goes to kitchen_]
     **Martin:** You know, Niles, you look like you need cheering up. 
    _Martin starts the "Dancing Santa" which knocks over all of the 
    presents, including one with makes a shattering noise._
      **Niles:** Daphne's present!
     **Martin:** Did it break?
    _Niles holds it and the sound of broken glass is obvious._
      **Niles:** Well, we won't know until she opens it!
     **Martin:** I'm sorry, but, hey look. [_gives him Mel's present_] You don't 
             need this one for Mel, do you?
      **Niles:** Well, I guess not.
     **Martin:** Okay, well here. [_swaps gift tags_] Put that in there, and this 
             right in here, problem solved.
    _Meanwhile, Frasier pushes Roz and Daphne out of the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** All right, now, you two, I don't want everyone congregating 
             in the kitchen.  Now go out and mingle!
        **Roz:**[_acting_] Niles!  Martin!  I didn't see you come in!
      **Niles:**[_echoing_] Roz!  Daphne!  I didn't want to give these out in 
             front of all the guests, but since there aren't any. [_hands 
             over presents_] Roz, this is for you, and Daphne, Merry 
             Christmas.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Merry Christmas, thank you, Dr. Crane.
    _Niles's mobile rings and takes it into the kitchen.  Meanwhile, the 
    ladies look at their gifts._
     **Daphne:**[_scared_] Oh no, it's jewelry.
        **Roz:**[_bored_] Oh no, it's a book.
    _DISSOLVE TO: 
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment - Later
    Frasier and Martin are looking up to the next floor.  Frasier is 
    holding a dish with some hors d'oeuvres on it._
    **Frasier:** My God, there must be a hundred people up there!  Well, 
             I'll just show you what you're missing! [_wafts the smell up_] 
             Savory lamb tenders!  Pesto-filled mushroom caps!  Smell �em 
             and weep! 
     **Martin:**[_patronizing_] Come on, Frasier.  Maybe we ought to walk you 
             back inside, there you are...
    **Frasier:**[_forlorn_] Oh, Dad...
    _Meanwhile, Niles is talking to Mel on the phone in the kitchen._
      **Niles:**[_into phone_] Yes, yes darling, that's wonderful.  I'll see you 
             soon. [_hangs up_]
    _Frasier enters._
      **Niles:** That was Mel! 
    **Frasier:** And?
      **Niles:** I managed to explain about Yoshi, she's on her way over.
    **Frasier:** Thank God!
      **Niles:** I know.
    **Frasier:** Another guest! [_off Niles's glare_] Oh, it's also wonderful 
             for you, Niles.  Congratulations.
      **Niles:** There is one minor detail I need to iron out.  I also got a 
             message from Maris saying she wants to see me again. [_gets a 
             bottle of water_] I think she may have mistaken last night's 
             sympathy for affection.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my. Well, Niles, if you want my advice-
      **Niles:** Ooh, you know, you really need to stop saying that.
    _Daphne enters, unseen by the brothers._
    **Frasier:** You've got to make your feelings clear to her, and the sooner 
             the better.  There's very little point letting it drag on like 
             this.
      **Niles:** You're right.  I'll speak to her tonight.
    _Daphne, getting the wrong end of the stick, gasps and exits the kitchen._
      **Niles:** At the moment, I just want to patch things up with Mel.
    **Frasier:** A-ha.  Well, you know, those antique earrings you bought her 
             should go a long way towards that.
      **Niles:**[_realizing_] Oh... I gave them to Daphne!
    **Frasier:** You did what?
      **Niles:** Well, Daphne's gift broke and I didn't think Mel was coming. 
             Dad suggested I switch the gift cards.
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake.  Dad and his meddling!  Well, if you want 
             my advice... [_off Niles's glare_] You know where to find me.
    _Meanwhile, out in room, Roz is getting her coat to leave as Daphne 
    catches her._
     **Daphne:** Roz!
        **Roz:** What?
     **Daphne:** You can't go.
        **Roz:** Why not?
    _Niles enters and catches Daphne._
      **Niles:** Daphne, I'm sorry to interrupt.  I need to speak with you. 
             It's a private matter, would you join me out on the balcony 
             for a moment?
     **Daphne:** All right.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    _Niles exits to the balcony._ 
        **Roz:** Whoa!  He's gonna tell you.
     **Daphne:**[_imitating her_] Oh no, not tonight, not while Donny's here! 
             [_then_] Roz!
        **Roz:** Okay, so I was wrong.  Boy, this is rough.  What are you going 
             to do?
     **Daphne:** I don't know.  I guess I won't give him the chance.  I'll speak 
             first, I'll just be direct.  I'll tell him I know how he feels 
             about me, but I don't feel that way about him.  I love Donny, 
             and nothing's going to happen between us.
        **Roz:** Good. [_re-thinks_] Luck!
    _Daphne exits to the balcony where Niles is waiting for her._
     **Daphne:** Hi.
      **Niles:** Daphne, er, I wish there were an easier way to say this, I...
     **Daphne:** Wait!  I have something I'd like to say first.  Dr. Crane, I 
             have to tell you that... 
    _Daphne looks at him and just cannot bring herself to say it._
      **Niles:** Oh Daphne, I am so sorry, what am I thinking?  Here.
    _Niles, in his usual act of chivalry, takes his coat off and puts it 
    around Daphne._
     **Daphne:** Oh, thank you.  Anyway, Dr. Crane, I know that... [_once again 
             she can't say it_]
      **Niles:** Yes?
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, I...
      **Niles:** Why don't I start?
     **Daphne:** No, Dr. Crane...
      **Niles:** No, no, I really need to say this, I can't wait any longer. 
             Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Yes?
      **Niles:** This is so difficult for me.
     **Daphne:**[_almost hoping_] Yes.
    _Pause._
      **Niles:** I need my Christmas present back.
     **Daphne:**...You what?!
    _Meanwhile, in the main room, Frasier, Martin, Donny and Roz are 
    slumped, bored out of their minds._
    **Frasier:** People will go almost anywhere for free food and booze.  
             Am I really so insufferable?
        **Roz:** I could call up the station and see if people want to come 
             over.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Oh yes, Roz, let's call in the second string 
             guests.  Let's fill my home with a bunch of angry, snubbed 
             co-workers. [_then_] Do you think they'd come?
    _Then a bunch of people begin entering and all is better._
    **Frasier:** Fashionably late!  Hello, everyone.  Come in, Merry Christmas. 
             Help yourself to the drinks.
    _Meanwhile, Donny smells a fish._
      **Donny:** Okay, Marty, how did you get these people down here?
     **Martin:** Oh, I just called an old buddy in the fire department and 
             told him that that many people in one place had to be a code 
             violation.
      **Donny:** Oh, that is smart.  But aren't there going to be the same 
             number of people down here?
    **Frasier:** All right, everyone, we'll start by singing some carols and 
             then we will choose our teams for "The Minister's Cat."
     **Martin:**[_to Donny_] I don't think that's going to be a problem.
    _Meanwhile, Niles and Daphne are still chatting out on the balcony._
      **Niles:** I feel terrible about this, and of course, I'll replace the 
             gift. 
     **Daphne:** That's all right. [_takes coat off_] Well, I won't be needing 
             this anymore. [_hands it back to him_]
      **Niles:** Daphne, Daphne, Daphne, you never finished what you were 
             going to say.
     **Daphne:** Oh, well, it was about the gift.  Well, I could see from the
             box that you got me jewelry from "Beady & Sons" and I didn't 
             get you anything nearly as grand.  Well, doesn't matter now.
    _Daphne looks into the apartment and notices Mel has arrived._
     **Daphne:** Oh, Mel.  She's here.
      **Niles:** Yes, excuse me.
    _Niles enters and approaches her as Daphne goes to Roz.  Niles picks up 
    the Christmas present on the way and changes tags._
      **Niles:** I'm so glad you came. [_gives her the present_] Merry Christmas.
        **Mel:** Merry Christmas. 
    _Meanwhile, Roz and Daphne have a little chat._
    
        **Roz:** So, how did it go?  Did you tell him?
     **Daphne:** Never got the chance, he went first.  It turned out he'd just 
             given me the wrong gift and wanted it back.
        **Roz:** You're kidding!  You must be so relieved.
     **Daphne:** I'll say!  I've never been so relieved in my life.
    _Frasier gathers everyone for the carols._
    **Frasier:** All right, everyone, we'll start with an easy one.
    _He strikes up the piano as everyone begins singing "Deck The Halls"._
     **Chorus:** Deck the halls with bows of holly,
             Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
             Tis' the season to be jolly,
             Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
             Don we now our gay apparel,
             Fa-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la.
    _As they are singing Daphne keeps glancing behind her at Niles and 
    Mel, who are kissing tenderly.  Daphne keeps looking at him with 
    sorrow.  Does she love him?
    
    End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Martin is standing on the balcony after the party.  He notices a 
    little black cowboy hat on the floor and realizes it's from his 
    "Dancing Santa."  It looks like he tried to use his magic sleigh, 
    as Martin looks down from the balcony trying to spot the fallen fat 
    man. 
    
    When Frasier arrives, he connects the two, and chases after him.

## Synopsis {kathy churay}

    
    
    **_THE FIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS  
    
      
    
      
    
    _ACT ONE  
    
      
    
    SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY  
    
      
    
    **As Frasier enters from the hallway, Martin is seated at the table
    fixing his "Dancin' Santa" tabletop decoration for Frasier's
    party the following evening. Frasier tries to discourage him as he
    goes to answer the door. It's Roz, bearing Frasier's large punch
    bowl she borrowed for a party of her own. Frasier has invited
    nearly his entire building, including Cam WInston, a neighbor with whom
    he's been feuding for some time. Daphne comes into the room and as
    Roz leaves, follows her out into the hallway.  
    
      
    
    HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT  
    
      
    
    Daphne tells Roz that she overheard something -- that Niles is in love
    with her. Roz is relieved that she wasn't the one to blow the
    secret. Daphne can't believe Roz never told her, but Roz explains
    that if Niles wasn't ready to do it, it was no one else's place to tell
    her. Daphne says she feels uncomfortable discussing it with Frasier
    -- he was taking painkillers and doesn't remember, and anyway he tells
    Niles everything. Then they'd all just feel awkward. Roz
    doesn't see why, since Niles has a girlfriend and Daphne is engaged to
    Donny.  
    
      
    
    Just then Niles gets off the elevator and greets them. Roz boards
    the elevator, leaving Daphne to make an awkward excuse and run into the
    elevator after her. Niles is puzzled but heads into the
    apartment  
    
      
    
    FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM  
    
      
    
    Niles hands Frasier the books he's brought, Victorian and Elizabethan
    Christmas carols for the party. Frasier invites him to the party,
    but Niles declines. He has to go and see Maris, to console her over
    the death of Yoshi, her gardener. Frasier advises him not to tell
    Mel, since "new girlfriends don't want to hear that you're consoling
    your ex-wife." Niles says that he hates to lie to Mel, but in
    the end he agrees and takes his leave.  
    
      
    
      
    
    **_SCENE TITLE: Anyone For A Hot Buttered Margarita?  
    
      
    
    _SCENE TWO - THE RADIO STATION - NEXT DAY  
    
      
    
    **A Mexican-themed Christmas party is in full swing as Kenny the
    station manager greets Frasier and drifts off. Roz comes over to
    ask what time the party is, and Fraiser cautions her to keep her voice
    down. No one else at the office has been invited because he's
    invited everyone in his building. Roz leaves and is replaced
    by Gil, who tempts Frasier with a plate of rather muscular-looking
    gingerbread men. Frasier declines, and Gil goes in search of other
    goodies.  
    
      
    
    Frasier lingers at the buffet table and turns around to see Mel, who has
    been invited because she was a radio show guest during the past
    year. Niles is hanging up their coats. Mel asks Frasier
    whether he and Niles had had a good dinner the night before, to which
    Frasier absently replies that he was too busy planning his party to have
    dinner with Niles. Mel looks incensed and goes off to confront
    Niles. Frasier abruptly realizes he's put his foot in it.  
    
      
    
    Niles comes over and tries to warn Frasier to cooperate with his cover
    story, but it's too late. Frasier tells him apologetically that
    he's already spilled the story to Mel. Niles rushes off after Mel
    as Frasier tries to explain that he's preoccupied because he's planning
    his party that evening for 200 people. Kenny walks by just in time
    to hear this, and is insulted that he wasn't invited.  
    
      
    
    ELSEWHERE AT THE PARTY  
      
    
    Niles tries to explain to Mel, who doesn't want to make a scene and
    insists they discuss things while wearing their "party
    faces." Smilingly she accuses him of being with another woman,
    and Niles fumbles that he wasn't out with Frasier because he was buying
    Mel's Christmas present. Mel relaxes in delight, and all is
    forgiven. Niles departs to hang up her coat, and Mel moves over to
    the punchbowl to get them some drinks.  
    
      
    
    At the punchbowl she meets Frasier, who apologizes for lying. Mel
    forgives him sweetly as Niles comes rushing over to prevent a further
    disaster. But it's too late as Fraiser manages to let on that Niles
    was with Maris the night before. That does it for Mel, and she's
    off to get her coat once again, Niles running after her. He tries
    to apologize, but she doesn't want to hear it. She tells him the
    relationship is finished and storms out.  
    
      
    
    Frasier tries to apologize to Niles, but Niles tells him loudly that all
    Frasier cares about is the party he's hosting that evening. Niles
    storms out too, leaving Frasier to face a roomful of accusatory
    coworkers.  
    
      
    
      
    
    **ACT TWO  
    
      
    
    SCENE TITLE: "Come A-Wassailin' to Frasier Crane's Holiday
    Fest. Elliott Bay Towers #1901. Regrets Only."  
    
      
    
    SCENE ONE - FRASIER'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT  
    
      
    
    **Donny and Daphne are all dressed up and seated at the piano, plunking
    out "Jingle Bells" while waiting for the other guests.
    The doorbell rings and Frasier asks Daphne to answer it, but it's only
    Niles bearing Christmas presents. Daphne inquires where Mel is and
    Niles replies that they broke up that afternoon. Donny asks how
    long they had been going out, whether they had discussed moving in
    together, etc. Niles smilingly accuses him of acting like a lawyer,
    but Donny replies that he was only trying to find out how big a drink to
    make for Niles. Big, replies Niles, and as Donny pours he asks
    whether there isn't some old flame who got away that he can call for
    consolation. Daphne snaps at Donny to leave Dr. Crane alone, and
    heads off to her room. Donny whispers to Niles that it isn't their
    fault -- the holidays make women crazy.  
    
      
    
    HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT  
    
      
    
    Frasier is skulking in the hall, waiting impatiently for some guests to
    arrive. Finally the elevator door opens to reveal a full carload of
    people, and Frasier warmly invites them all inside. But only Roz
    gets off at Frasier's floor. She tells him that his feuding
    neighbor, Cam Winston, is having his own competing party, and all the
    people are going there instead. Frasier is incensed and goes back
    into the apartment.  
    
      
    
    FRASIER'S LIVING ROOM  
    
      
    
    Donny tells Frasier that he noticed a big sign for the Winston party in
    the lobby. Frasier hastily makes a sign of his own and dispatches
    Donny to the lobby to post it. Roz departs for the kitchen,
    followed by Daphne.  
    
      
    
    THE KITCHEN  
    
      
    
    Roz makes a call on her cell phone as Daphne comes in to tell her that
    Niles broke up with Mel. Roz says she overheard them at the office
    Christmas party. Dahpne wants to know what they said, and Roz tells
    her Mel accused Niles of still being in love with someone else.
    Daphne is appalled and is sure it's her. How will she ever let him
    down gently? It's always messy and you're never friends afterward
    -- it ruins everything. Roz reassures her that Niles won't say
    anything that evening because Donny is there.  
    
      
    
    THE LIVING ROOM  
    
      
    
    Frasier pushes Donny out the door with the party sign, then goes to the
    kitchen to check on his canapes. Martin and Niles arrange gifts on
    the console table as Martin notices that Niles needs cheering up.
    Reaching for the "Dancin' Santa" to give Niles a laugh, Martin
    knocks a gift off the table. Niles picks it up and shakes it
    ruefully -- it's Daphne's present, now broken into pieces. Martin
    tells him to just switch the gift cards with Mel's gift, since Mel won't
    be coming that evening. Niles reluctantly agrees.  
    
      
    
    Frasier pushes Daphne and Roz out of the kitchen, and they come over to
    greet Martin and Niles. Niles hands them their gifts and moves away
    to take a call on his cell phone. Daphne notices with alarm that
    judging by the size of the box, Niles has given her jewelry. Roz
    notes with equal discomfort that she's gotten a book.  
    
      
    
    **SCENE TWO - THE BALCONY - LATER  
    
      
    
    **Fraiser and Martin stare up at the balcony above their apartment, as
    Frasier remarks in despair that there must be a hundred people up at
    Winston's party. Martin guides him back into the apartment.  
    
      
    
    THE KITCHEN  
    
      
    
    Frasier dumps his party tray in the kitchen as Niles wraps up a call on
    his cell phone. He explains in relief that Mel has forgiven him and
    is coming over to the party after all. The only problem is that
    Maris also wants to see him, having mistaken his sympathy for
    affection. Behind the two of them, Daphne comes into the kitchen
    just in time to overhear Frasier advise that Niles needs to make his
    feelings clear to her instead of letting the situation drag on.
    Daphne assumes the comment is about her and backs out in alarm.
    Niles is unaware of her eavedropping and continues that he now has a
    different problem -- how to get Mel's gift back from Daphne.  
    
      
    
    THE LIVING ROOM  
    
      
    
    Niles exits the kitchen in time to see Roz heading out the door with
    Daphne on her heels. He interrupts them to tell Daphne he needs to
    speak to her privately on the balcony. Daphne agrees, and he goes
    out the glass doors to wait for her. Daphne's in a panic trying to
    decide what to tell him. Finally she declares that she will simply
    speak first -- she'll tell Niles that she doesn't feel the same way about
    him, that she loves Donny and nothing is going to happen between
    them. Roz wishes her luck as Daphne heads for the balcony.  
    
      
    
    THE BALCONY  
    
      
    
    Daphne comes out onto the balcony in her flimsy evening dress and begins
    to launch into her speech. Niles notices her folded arms and
    realizes she's cold. Apologetically he takes off his suit jacket
    and gently slips it over her shoulders. Daphne is totally disarmed
    by his chivalrous gesture. She starts into her speech several
    times, but each time as she looks at him she trails off in
    confusion. She's gazing into his eyes as if really seeing him for
    the very first time. Niles is preoccupied and doesn't
    notice.  
    
      
    
    Finally Niles goes into his own speech saying he simply can't wait any
    longer.   
    
      
    
    "Yes?" Daphne sighs, looking at him with something that might
    almost be hope.   
    
      
    
    "This is so difficult for me..." he stammers in polite
    embarrassment.   
    
      
    
    "Yes?" she asks breathlessly.  
    
      
    
    "I need my Christmas present back," he finishes with
    relief.   
    
      
    
    "You what?" she replies in disbelief.  
    
      
    
    THE LIVING ROOM  
    
      
    
    Frasier, Martin, Roz and Donny are sitting around disconsolately as
    Frasier bemoans the lack of guests at the party. Just then the
    front door opens and people begin streaming in. Frasier bounces up
    off the couch and greets them ecstatically.  
    
      
    
    Donny takes Martin aside and asks him how he got the guests to the
    party. Martin replies that he called an old friend from the Fire
    Department to report the overcrowding at the other party, in violation of
    fire safety laws.  
    
      
    
    THE BALCONY  
    
      
    
    Niles finishes his explanation about the gift. Daphne has recovered
    herself and explains that she had just wanted to tell him she hadn't
    gotten him anything nearly as grand as the jewelry he got her. She
    hands him his jacket and turns back to the party, spotting Mel through
    the glass doors. Niles goes in to greet Me.  
    
      
    
    THE PARTY  
    
      
    
    Niles picks up Mel's gift, removes Daphne's gift tag, and hands it to
    Mel. They kiss tenderly.  
    
      
    
    Roz sidles over to Daphne to ask what happened. Daphne laughs that
    Niles just wanted his gift back for Mel. Roz observes that Daphne
    must be so relieved. Yes, agrees Daphne cheerfully, she's never
    been so relieved in her life.  
    
      
    
    Frasier calls the guests together to start Christmas carols, and Daphne
    moves to join them, looking over her shoulder at Mel and Niles.
    Niles is smiling at her as she puts on the lovely earrings he got
    her.  
    
      
    
    Daphne turns back to the carolers, then after a moment turns back to Mel
    and Niles, gazing at the pair a bit sadly from far across the room.  
    
      
    
    **FADE OUT.  
    
      
    
      
    
      
    
    **(MISSING CREDIT TAG - SORRY!)
