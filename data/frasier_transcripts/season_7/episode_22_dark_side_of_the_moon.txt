    _Act One
    
    Scene One - Therapist's Room.
    A female therapist, Dr. McCaskill, is holding up an ink-blot to Daphne._
    
    **McCaskill:** What do you see here?
       **Daphne:** It's two bunnies clawing each other to death over a lima 
               bean. [_McCaskill writes in her pad_] Forgive me, Dr. 
               McCaskill, but this game seems rather silly.
    **McCaskill:** Well, I understand how you might feel that way but it's 
               helpful to me.  Now, last one. [_holds another ink-blot up_]
       **Daphne:** It's a woman.
    **McCaskill:**[_noting down_] Okay, then.
       **Daphne:** She's skinning a pigeon with a hatchet. 
    
    _McCaskill makes changes to her original note._
    
       **Daphne:** Are we done now?
    **McCaskill:** I think we still have some work to do.
       **Daphne:** I just don't think there's any good reason for me to be here.
    **McCaskill:** The judge felt differently. 
       **Daphne:** Oh, what does he know?  Saying I need anger management!  
               I'm not an angry person, I never have been.
    **McCaskill:** Daphne, wasn't it anger that led you to cause that four-car 
               accident?
       **Daphne:** Well, yes, but I was provoked into that.  I'm not angry 
               anymore.
    **McCaskill:** Well, there may be a level of emotion you're not entirely 
               in touch with.  Let's talk about your life in general.  
               You said you had a fiance?
       **Daphne:** Yes, Donny.  He's a wonderful, generous man...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Niles's Apartment.
    Daphne carries on talking to her therapist as she flashes back 
    to this scene: Daphne is sat on the fainting couch made up in a 
    beautiful dress.  Her air is expectant.._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] ...in fact, he did the sweetest thing for me last week, 
             totally out of the blue.
    _Everyone jumps out yelling "surprise!" and rushes to meet her.  From 
    the way she gasps and bugs her eyes, we see her surprise is total.  
    She's shaking like a leaf as Donny holds her.  Niles, Mel, Frasier, 
    Roz and Martin among others are there._
    
      **Donny:** Welcome to your shower, honey.  Oh my God, you're trembling.
     **Daphne:** Yes, well, I'm absolutely blown away.
      **Niles:** Oh, come on, Daphne, you were on to us.
     **Daphne:** No, really, you had me completely fooled. 
      **Donny:** We may have an even bigger surprise for you later on, but 
             first things first: let's get you some champagne.
    
    _Donny and Daphne kiss as Daphne speaks over the top._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] I'm not usually much for surprise parties, but I can 
             see how much trouble Donny went to.  He invited all my 
             friends, made the food, he even planned some games.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne carries on._
    
       **Daphne:** We played this one game where everyone's in groups and 
               each group dresses one person in a bridal gown made out 
               of toilet paper.  I can't remember what it's called...
    **McCaskill:**[_annoyed_] "Toilet paper bridal gown"!
       **Daphne:** Yes, that's it.  Have you played?
    **McCaskill:** I'm familiar with it.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Niles's Apartment.
    Daphne flashes back to later on that night.  We see the three teams 
    frantically trying to finish their gowns as Daphne sits on the couch._
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] Then you know, as the bride, I had to judge which 
             group made the best dress while another woman was in charge 
             of...
        **Mel:**[_blows whistle loudly_] Time!!!  Stop right now, or you'll be 
             disqualified.  Team A! 
    
    [_N.B. One of the few instances in the series of Jane Adams's remarkable 
    lung power._]
    _Donny comes out wearing a mashed gown; he looks more like a mummy 
    than a bride._
    
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] Very nice, Donny.
        **Mel:** Team B!
    _Niles turns away from Martin, who simply has a few strips wrapped 
    crosswise over his plaid shirt, and a clump on top of his head.  
    He looks like a finished Christmas parcel._
    
      **Niles:** We're not finished yet!
     **Martin:** You shouldn't have spent so much time with the sketches!
        **Mel:** Team C!  Where's Team C?  Team C, time!
    _Frasier exits from the kitchen singing the wedding march.  He is
    followed by Roz in a most exquisite toilet paper gown - it looks 
    almost real.  She is carrying a toilet paper bouquet and so are 
    her two toilet paper bridesmaids._
    
    **Frasier:** You'll notice that I used the quilted variety for the bonnet 
             and the edging on the veil.
     **Daphne:** Well, you all look fantastic but I think we have a winner... 
             Team C!
    _Roz throws her bouquet up in excitement; meanwhile Holly chats with 
    Donny._
      **Holly:** Donny, I'm sorry.
      **Donny:** Oh, Holly, it's not your fault, I should have been more 
             radiant.
    
    _Frasier walks up to Daphne._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne, if there happens to be another game that we play, 
             do you think that you could arrange for me to be on the same 
             team as your friend Holly there?
     **Daphne:** Oh, developed a little crush, have we?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I have.  It's just that I haven't had 
             much of a chance to get to speak with her at all.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'll do what I can, but I'm not really in charge here-
    
    _Mel blows her whistle showing who's the dominant one._
    
        **Mel:**[_shouts_] All right, people, next game - bridal charades!
    _The doorbell sounds, Donny takes Daphne to the door as Frasier chats 
    with Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, you know, some day you're going to make a beautiful 
             bride.  Of course, your dress won't be made out of toilet 
             paper. [_Roz laughs_]
      **Niles:** Or be white.
    _Roz playfully hits him with her bouquet as Donny makes an announcement._
      **Donny:** Daphne, your big surprise has arrived.  This is someone that 
             I know you are dying to see.
     **Daphne:** Your parents?
      **Donny:** No, not till next week.
     **Daphne:**[_worried_] My mother?
      **Donny:** No, someone good.
     **Daphne:**[_hopeful_] My brother?
      **Donny:** Your favorite brother!
     **Daphne:**[_jumps up and down_] Yeah, Steven!
      **Donny:** Ste... no. 
     **Daphne:** Billy?
      **Donny:** Em...
     **Daphne:** Michael?
      **Donny:** Well...
     **Daphne:** Nigel?  David?
    _The most drunken, boorish voice in the British Isles booms through the 
    door._
      **Simon:**[_o.s._] Hello, thirsty man waitin' out here!
     **Daphne:**[_disgusted_] Simon!
    _Donny opens the door to a brutish Brit who shoves his duffel bag in 
    his face._
    
      **Simon:** Daphne!  Come 'ere.
    _He opens his arms for a hug and then twists her into a head-lock, 
    mussing up her hair with his fists._
    
     **Daphne:** Everyone, this is my brother, Simon. [_they all greet him_]
      **Simon:** Stilts, aren't you a sight!
      **Niles:** "Stilts"?
     **Daphne:** Growing up I was a bit tall for my age.
      **Simon:** Giant, like she was on stilts.
     **Daphne:** They follow you, Simon.
      **Simon:** Yeah, right.  Well, it's nice to meet you all.  Especially 
             whichever one's the bartender.
        **Roz:**[_stands suggestively_] Oh, that would be me!
      **Simon:** Oh and a pretty little bartender you are.
        **Roz:** Right this way.
      **Simon:** After you. [_follows her_] I'd rather walk behind you anyway!
        **Roz:** I just love your accent, it's so sophisticated!
    _FADE OUT_
    **MANCHESTER UNITED**
    
    _Scene Five - Niles's Apartment.
    We pick up where we left off.  Martin and Frasier are talking to 
    Donny by the door._
    
      **Donny:** Oh boy, I really screwed up, didn't I?
    **Frasier:** Now, isn't Steven the favorite brother?
      **Donny:** Yes.
     **Martin:** Even I knew that, and I barely listen to her.
      **Donny:**[_to Daphne_] I know, I know, I know, I got the names mixed 
             up, but you have mentioned Simon too.
     **Daphne:** Yes, as a free-loader who just sits around the house 
             drinking beer all day.
     **Martin:** Well, that's a lot of people.
     **Daphne:**[_excusing him_] You're retired.
    
    _Meanwhile, at the bar, Roz and Holly are all over Simon._
    
      **Holly:** You have such a dirty mind.
        **Roz:** And that would be a terrible thing to waste.
     **Daphne:**[_comes over_] Simon!
    
    _She drags him away._
    
      **Simon:** Yeah, right.
     **Daphne:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane and his father, Martin.
    
    _They all greet each other._
    
     **Daphne:** There are the people I work for.  You've met my fiancee,
             Donny.
      **Simon:** Oh, thanks for flying me out, mate.
     **Daphne:** About that, didn't it seem unusual to you when he called you 
             my favorite brother?
      **Simon:** Now that you mention it, it did strike my ear as a bit odd, 
             you being so partial to Steven. 
    _He sits on the couch, puts his feet up on the seat and lights a 
    cigarette, to Niles and Mel's discomfort._
      **Simon:** But then I thought, women change their minds all the time, 
             brothers fall in and out of favor.  Maybe it's my turn.  And, 
             er, good thing too, as it was an especially good time for me 
             to get out of England.
        **Roz:** God, he talks just like a prince!
      **Niles:** So, Simon, where are you staying? [_holds out ash tray_]
      **Simon:** Thanks, mate. [_flicks ash into tray but doesn't take it_] 
             Em, Donny here says that Frasier's offered to put me up.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, when he told me he was inviting Daphne's favorite 
             brother, I didn't hesitate.  Of course, well, the sad truth 
             is, we really don't have a bed for you.
      **Simon:** Oh, a couch'll suit me just fine.
    **Frasier:** Well, you wouldn't really be comfortable there for more than 
             a day or two.
      **Simon:** Oh, don't worry about that.  I once slept on a couch for 
             three months before I even realized it pulled out.
    **Frasier:** Ah!
      **Simon:** The main thing is that I spend as much time as possible with 
             my baby sister!
    _Simon playfully knocks Daphne, who spills her glass of red wine over 
    her dress._
     **Daphne:** Simon, look what you did! 
    
    _Daphne carries on with her story._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] It was my absolute favorite dress, one I saved for 
             special occasions; he wasn't in the door five minutes before 
             he ruined it.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Six - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne carries on with the doctor._
    
    **McCaskill:** And yet you still felt responsible for putting him up.
       **Daphne:** I didn't have much choice.  If I turned him out, I'd never 
               hear the end of it from mum.
    **McCaskill:** I'm hearing that your relatives are a source of anger for 
               you.
       **Daphne:** So?  Aren't yours?
    **McCaskill:** Well, they might be if I still talked to any of them!
    
    _She laughs but stops when she realizes Daphne didn't join in._
    
    **McCaskill:** Anyway, I can see how your brother's presence was adding 
               stress, but what I'm not sure of is how you got from there 
               to causing a four car pile-up.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Frasier's Apartment.
    We see Daphne cleaning up Simon's mess on the coffee table.  Daphne 
    once again narrates the scene at first._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] Well, things got much more difficult once Simon settled 
             into the house.
    _Frasier enters the apartment as Daphne quickly takes Simon's plates 
    from view._
    
     **Daphne:**[_putting on a brave face_] Good evening, Dr. Crane!  I hope 
             you had a pleasant day.
    **Frasier:**[_seeing straight through her_] Where's Simon?
     **Daphne:** I think he's out with Mr. Crane again.  They seem to have 
             taken quite a shine to each other.  Simon's introduced him 
             to rugby.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I really must thank him for that!  After all, poor Dad, 
             before he came, had no sport to watch between the hours of 
             two and six AM!  Did you happen to see the kitchen this 
             morning?
     **Daphne:** Yes, I guess they got some take-out.
    **Frasier:** It looked like a Kung Pao bomb went off!  I still have moo 
             shoo stuck in the tread of my driving Moccasins!
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry Simon's been such an imposition.  But he's leaving 
             soon, he's decided to tour the West Coast until the wedding.
    **Frasier:** Oh Lord, that's a relief.
     **Daphne:** Yes. [_faking a surprised thought_] Oh, by the by, I invited 
             my friend, Holly, over for drinks tonight.  Maybe you could 
             join us, might give you two an opportunity to get better 
             acquainted.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, if you're offering up your attractive friend as some 
             sort of a peace offering - well then, I accept.  I better go 
             and make myself look irresistible.
     **Daphne:** Well, you won't have time for much, she's on her way now.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's probably better that way - you know, give her a 
             fighting chance.
    
    _Frasier exits to his room as Martin enters through the front door 
    with Eddie._
    
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, I thought you were out with Simon.
     **Martin:** Nope, just Eddie.
     **Daphne:** Then where's Simon?
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] Daphne!!
    
    _Frasier runs on in a mad rush._
    
    **Frasier:** Your brother's in my bed... nude!!
     **Daphne:**[_shouts down hallway_] Simon Moon, get out of Dr. Crane's room!
     **Martin:** Oh, that poor guy probably just needed a nap, it's the jet-lag.  
             Couple of days and he'll be on our time.
    **Frasier:** A couple more days, he'll be on our sidewalk!
    
    _Simon enters in a robe and smoking a cigarette._
    
      **Simon:** Sorry about that, I'm a bit sleepy today.  I think I'm coming 
             down with a cold.
    
    _Simon gives a smoker's cough._
    
    **Frasier:** Nothing another night of drinking won't cure, I'm sure. 
      **Simon:** Well, let's hope.
    **Frasier:** Is that my robe you're wearing?
      **Simon:** Yeah, yeah, you want it back? [_begins to untie it_]
    **Frasier:**[_in horror_] No, no.
      **Simon:** No, it's all right, I've got shorts on. [_shows him_]
    **Frasier:** Are those my shorts?
      **Simon:** Well, I didn't think you'd mind, I found them on the 
             bathroom floor.
    
    _Frasier holds himself in disgust._
    
     **Daphne:** If you need to lie down you can use my room. [_gives him 
             duffel bag_]
      **Simon:** All right, don't forget to wake me for dinner, will ya?
     **Daphne:** I woke you for lunch, didn't I?
      **Simon:** Yeah, right.
    
    _Simon exits to Daphne's room as the doorbell sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh dear God, that'll be Holly.  Dad, make yourself scarce. 
             [_Martin exits as Frasier opens the door_] Ah, Holly, hello 
             again.
      **Holly:** Hello, Dr. Crane, nice to see you again.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, please, call me Frasier, come in.
     **Daphne:** Hi, Holly, I'm glad you could make it.
      **Holly:** Me too.  My boss can be such a pain.
     **Daphne:** Too bad, this one here keeps me in stitches all day long.
    **Frasier:**[_looks at Holly_] Wokka, Wokka! [_he sighs_] Let me bring you 
             girls some drinks.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no, no, no, let me get them.  Could you keep Holly 
             company?
    **Frasier:** All right, well, Holly, please have a seat. [_they sit_] Er, 
             gosh, em, you know, we really didn't get much of a chance to 
             talk at the shower.  But, er, let me see, you're in the music 
             business aren't you?
      **Holly:** Yes, right now I'm planning a Reggae festival on Mercer 
             Island.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, I'll have to remind myself to take the Rasta-ferry 
             over and catch it. [_laughs with Holly_]
    
    _Daphne enters with the drinks._
    
      **Holly:** Frasier just told the cutest little joke.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry, I came back as quickly as possible. [_off 
             Frasier's glance_] Oh, I just remembered I left a tray of hors 
             d'oeuvres on the kitchen counter.
      **Holly:** No, let me Daphne, I'm not going to let you wait on me all 
             night.
     **Daphne:** Oh, thank you.
    
    _Holly leaves to the kitchen who is shortly followed by Simon._
    
    **Frasier:** Allow me. [_pours drinks_]
     **Daphne:** Well?
    **Frasier:** Well, I like her, actually.  You know, I thinks she likes me 
             too.
     **Daphne:** So, are you going to ask her out?
    **Frasier:** Oh, now, now, now, Daphne.  You can't rush things with a girl 
             like Holly.  After all, she's the kind of girl you just don't 
             do that to.  Yes, she has to be wooed.
    _Meanwhile it seems that Simon isn't taking very long to woo Holly 
    as he already has his tongue down her throat in the entrance to the 
    kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** And to be honest, this is the part of the dance that excites 
             me the most: the coy verbal exchange, the subtle body 
             language, the probing glances as we explore a mutual 
             passion.
     **Daphne:**[_noticing her brother_] That jacket you're wearing might be a 
             bit too conservative, why don't you go and change?
    **Frasier:**[_stands_] All right, all right, what do you think?  Maybe a 
             sweater?  Do you think I'd look more free-wheeling in my blue 
             and my...
    
    _Frasier notices the happy couple._
    
    **Frasier:** Good God. [_shouts over_] He has a cold, you know!
    
    _Frasier exits as Holly and Simon turn to look at him.
    
    End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne is conveying the rest of her story._
    
       **Daphne:** I had no idea that Simon and Holly had gotten so close at 
               my wedding shower.  Of course, try telling that to Dr. 
               Crane.
    **McCaskill:** He blames you for what happened?
       **Daphne:** Of course he did.  The tension in the house was just getting 
               worse.  Then two nights later, I thought I was getting a 
               break from it all.  I had the house all to myself for a 
               change...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Daphne narrates over the scene.  Daphne is sat in Martin's chair with 
    her hair tied above her head, her dressing gown on, spot cream dotted 
    on her face and lip wax making her look like a "Got Milk?" advert._
    
     **Daphne:**[_v.o._] ...Which was a good thing because I was meeting Donny's 
             parents the next day.  I decided I'd use the evening to take a 
             nice hot bath, give meself a manicure - you know, how you do.
    
    _Then Frasier enters the apartment._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, what happened to your concert?
    **Frasier:** Simon happened.  I've caught his wretched cold.  I think I'm 
             just going to go curl up in bed.  After all, if I don't take 
             care of myself, who will?  Make me some tea and honey, won't 
             you?
    
    _Frasier exits to his room as Martin enters._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Daph.
     **Daphne:** I thought you and Simon were watching the game down at 
             McGinty's.
     **Martin:** Oh, the cable went out, I'll just watch it here.
     **Daphne:** Then where's Simon?
     **Martin:** He's at the bar, he met some people. [_she heads to the kitchen_] 
             Oh, listen, if you're going in the kitchen, would you get me a 
             beer? [_she does_] He's a real knack for making friends, and a 
             great storyteller! [_sits down_] Is it true you wet your pants 
             the first time you saw a Chinese person?
    
    _Daphne enters with his beer._
    
     **Daphne:** He told you that?!
     **Martin:** Oh, he's gonna kill me, he was going to try to work it into 
             his wedding toast!
    _Simon and company enter through the door with a raucous roar.  He is 
    with two beer-bellied men, and he's also giving a young blond woman 
    a piggy-back ride.  They land on the couch._
    
      **Simon:** Come in and make ya'selves comfortable.  Hey, Stilts, I didn't 
             know you'd be home!  God, what a sight!  If you took your 
             teeth out and put them in your pocket you'd look like Mum.
     **Daphne:** Oh, sod off, Simon.  Who are these people?
      **Simon:** Oh, these are some new friends of mine, they've come down to 
             watch the game.  This is Stan. [_Stan nods_] This is...
       **Judd:**[_helping him_] ...Judd.
      **Simon:** Judd, yeah. [_pointing to his new date_] And this here is Paris.
     **Martin:** Paris?  Does that make you French?
      **Paris:** No, but a couple of beers might.
    
    _They all laugh, excluding an agitated Daphne as Frasier enters._
    
    **Frasier:** What on earth is going on out here?
     **Martin:** Oh, it's no big deal, a few people just came over to watch 
             the game.
    **Frasier:** Well, you might have consulted with me first!
     **Daphne:** Let's get you back to bed, Dr. Crane, I'll bring you your tea 
             in a minute.
    **Frasier:** Very well, Daphne. [_directed at Simon_] It seems I've caught 
             a cold from someone!
      **Simon:** Oh, you might have mentioned that before I took a nap in 
             your bed.
    
    _Frasier grimaces and exits as Daphne leaves to the kitchen._
    
      **Simon:** If you don't mind me saying, Marty, you're a saint for putting 
             up with that man.  Your life must be very trying, very trying 
             indeed.
     **Martin:** Oh, do not get me started!
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
     **Daphne:** Could someone get that?  I have a tray to make for Dr. Crane.
      **Simon:** Bring out some beers, would ya'! 
    _He answers the door to Roz._
        **Roz:**[_provocative_] Hi, Simon.
      **Simon:**[_confused_] Hello.
        **Roz:** Are you ready... to go... dinner... you made a date.
      **Simon:**[_half-hearted_] Of course, a date!  Er, just hang on there a 
             minute, er... [_tries to guess the name_]
     **Daphne:**[_enters with Frasier's tray_] Hello, Roz.
      **Simon:** Roz, yeah, I forgot where I put my jacket.
    
    _Paris hands it over._
    
      **Paris:** Right here.
      **Simon:** Right, well, I'm just going out for a bit, love, make yourself 
             comfortable, I won't be late.
    
    _Simon kisses Paris and wonders over to a peeved Roz._
    
        **Roz:** I don't believe this.  I got dressed up, I got a sitter and 
             you don't even remember we made a date!  Some classy brother, 
             Daphne!
      **Simon:** Now you're making me feel bad.  I tell you what: dinner's on 
             me tonight. [_then_] Daph, can I talk to you for a minute?
        **Roz:** Don't bother, Simon. [_slams door in his face_]
     **Martin:** Hey, can you keep it down, the game's on.  Daph, how about 
             some snacks?
       **Judd:** Well, maybe a couple of sandwiches.
     **Daphne:**[_puts down tray_] Oh, get it yourself!  I have laundry to check 
             on!
      **Simon:** Did you do my delicates?
     **Daphne:** Oh!
    
    _Daphne runs out the front door.
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne is pacing the floor._
    
     **Daphne:** I thought I'd cool off while I was in the laundry room, 
             but no such luck!
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    Simon, Paris, Judd, Stan and Martin are watching the game as Daphne 
    enters, still with all her cosmetics on, holding up the dress she wore 
    to her bridal shower. It is stained throughout by bleach._
    
     **Daphne:**[_crying_] Look at this!  My favorite dress ruined!
    
    _The rest cheer at the television, not listening to Daphne._
    
     **Daphne:** When I got that wine stain out, someone pulled it out of the 
             machine and tossed it into a puddle of bleach!
    
    _The rest of them cheer again._
    
     **Daphne:** I got them back, though.  I pulled all their clothes out of 
             the drier and threw them onto the dirty wet floor... Oh, what 
             do you care?!  I need a drink!  A big one! [_exits to kitchen_]
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
      **Simon:** Oh, that'll be my date again.  I knew she couldn't stay mad 
             long. [_calls_] Coming, Rose!
    
    _Simon opens the door to Donny and his parents._
    
      **Donny:** Hi.
      **Simon:** Hello, Donny.  Who's this, then?
      **Donny:** My mom and dad.  I was picking them up at the airport, they 
             couldn't wait to meet Daphne.  This is Simon, Daphne's 
             brother.
      **Simon:**[_shaking hands_] Oh, nice to meet you, yeah, how are you?  
             Eh, word to the wise, Daphne's in a bit of a mood tonight.
     **Martin:**[_stands_] Why don't I just let her know that you're here?
    _Martin however is too late as Daphne enters pouring a full glass of 
    whisky._
     **Daphne:** There, that's the last of that bottle! 
     **Martin:**[_helping her_] Daphne, thanks for bringing in my whisky!
     **Daphne:**[_not realizing_] It's mine!  If you want it, you'll have to 
             fight me for it, old man! 
      **Donny:**[_runs over_] Honey, honey! [_she notices them_] Mom, Dad, er, 
             this is my fiancee, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Hello. [_puts bottles down_] Donny, I thought we were doing 
             this tomorrow.
      **Donny:** We wanted to surprise you.
     **Daphne:** Why?  Because your last surprise worked out so well?!
        **Mom:** We should have called first.
     **Daphne:** No, I'm so embarrassed, I'm such a mess.
      **Donny:** Come on, honey, you've looked worse.
     **Daphne:** Donny!
        **Dad:** I think we'd better go home.
     **Daphne:** Oh, no, no.  Please, come in, the more the merrier.
    
    _The doorbell sounds._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, for God's sake, who the hell is that now?!
    
    _Donny's mom pats her son's hand._
    
        **Mom:** She's very lovely.
    
    _Daphne opens the door to a woman with a laundry basket._
    
      **Woman:** I know what you did.  Someone saw you leave the laundry room. 
             You threw all my wet clothes all over the floor!
    
    _And that's the straw that breaks the camel's back._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize they were still wet. [_takes 
             basket_] Here, let me help.
      **Woman:** What are you doing?
     **Daphne:**[_throws some socks into the fireplace_] Ooh, that's nice and 
            hot...
      **Woman:** Stop it!
     **Daphne:** What, not fast enough for you?
      **Woman:** Stop it!
    
    _Daphne opens the door to the balcony._
    
     **Daphne:** Maybe if we air-dried them!
    _Daphne, in a sudden mad turn, throws all the laundry off the balcony._
    **Daphne:** There! That should do it.  Ya happy now?!?!
    _Then we hear cars beeping in the streets below, then tires screeching,
    and then four separate crashes.  On each one Daphne looks worse and 
    worse, as Martin and Donny wince and his parents look appalled.
    
    Amidst all the disaster, Frasier enters from his room._
    
    **Frasier:** Fine!  I guess I'll just have to make my own tea!!
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne is finishing his story._
    
       **Daphne:** It never occurred to me that stuff would fall on people's 
               windshields.
    **McCaskill:** Well, I can certainly see why you felt provoked.
       **Daphne:** Thank you.  Now, if the judge'd seen it your way, we could 
               have all saved ourselves a lot of time.
    **McCaskill:** There's something that confuses me just a little.
       **Daphne:** Yes?
    **McCaskill:** This dress that was ruined, you keep saying it was your 
               favorite.
       **Daphne:** That's right.
    **McCaskill:** So, why were you wearing it at your bridal shower?
       **Daphne:** Well, it's a momentous event, don't you think?
    **McCaskill:** But you said it was a surprise.
       **Daphne:** Well, yes... [_realizes_] It was.
    **McCaskill:** So, just what were you expecting when you went over there?
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Six - Niles's Apartment.
    She flashes back to before the bridal shower.  Niles answers the door 
    to Daphne._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne, right on time.  I'm glad you're here, come in.  
             Let me take your coat. [_he does so_]
     **Daphne:** I brought the recipe.
      **Niles:** Hmm?  Oh, for sticky toffee pudding... mmmm...
     **Daphne:**[_suggestively_] Well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?  To teach 
             you to make it.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    
    _Daphne gives a provocative knowing wink._
    
      **Niles:** You're not buying it, are you?
     **Daphne:** No, not really.
      **Niles:** So, do you know why I asked you here tonight? [_they sit_]
     **Daphne:**[_flirting_] I think I do.  I mean, when a man asks you to his 
             house to make pudding on a Saturday night...
      **Niles:** A pretty flimsy excuse, wasn't it?
     **Daphne:** Well, it got me here.
      **Niles:** I'm glad.
    
    _Niles touches his arm to which Daphne reacts with comfort._
    
      **Niles:** Make yourself comfortable.
     **Daphne:** All right.
    
    _Niles exits leaving a very nervous Daphne sat on the fainting couch 
    and as before...
    
    Everyone jumps out yelling "surprise!" and rushes to meet her.  
    From the way she gasps and bugs her eyes, we see her surprise 
    is total.  She's shaking like a leaf as Donny holds her.  
    Niles, Mel, Frasier, Roz and Martin among others are there._
    
      **Donny:** Welcome to your shower, honey. Oh my God, you're trembling.
     **Daphne:** Yes, well, I'm absolutely blown away.
      **Niles:** Oh, come on, Daphne, you were on to us.
     **Daphne:** No, really, you had me completely fooled. 
    
    _As everyone crowds around Daphne, her attention is focused on 
    Niles, who sneaks Mel a kiss._
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Therapist's Room.
    Daphne is sat in revelation of her love._
    
       **Daphne:** My God!  Dr. Crane...
    **McCaskill:** You know, it might be time to start calling him Niles.
       **Daphne:** This is confusing.  I mean what about Donny?  He's the man 
               I love.
    **McCaskill:** Are you sure about that?
       **Daphne:**[_crying_] ...No.  Oh, so many questions.  What does this 
               mean?  What do I do?
    **McCaskill:** I'm sorry, but... our time is up!
    
    _Daphne takes a tissue and dries her eyes._

    **Credits:**
    
    Simon and company have collapsed all around Frasier's apartment.  
    The place is an utter mess.  Frasier enters, shocked by the events. 
    He tries to wake them up by clapping his hands, shaking their chairs 
    and even coughing in Simon's direction.  Finally, he relents, takes a 
    beer from amid the clutter and exits to his room.  Then, seeing he 
    has gone, the rest awake and carry on with their party.
