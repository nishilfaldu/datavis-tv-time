    _ACT THREE
    
    Scene One - Lounge at Wayside Inn
    FADE IN: 
    
    The lounge off the dining room of the Wayside Inn.  Frasier enters with 
    a Miss Carney, the hostess._
     **Carney:** This is the lounge.  And through there is the dining area 
             where the rehearsal dinner will be.
    **Frasier:** Oh, this is lovely.  Say, have you seen the bride-to-be yet?  
             I'd like to have a word with her.
     **Carney:** No, I haven't. 
    _Donny and Daphne enter from the dining area._
      **Donny:** So, I thought we'd have the toast right before desert.
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Gosh Daphne, I was wondering where you'd gotten to yesterday.
     **Daphne:** Well, after the caterer's, I went straight to Donny's so 
             we could leave bright and early together.  It's lovely up  
             here, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.
      **Donny:** Anybody else want something from the bar? [_To bartender_]  
             Uh, Scotch, rocks.
     **Daphne:** Donny, it's barely noon!
      **Donny:** Isn't that when your mom said she'd be here?
     **Daphne:**[_to bartender_] Give him a double.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I was actually hoping that I could- 
    _Roz enters._
        **Roz:** Oh, I'll have whatever he's having.
     **Daphne:** Roz!
        **Roz:** I don't even know why I agreed to come to this wedding.  Hi, 
             Daphne.  I was all set to drive up here myself, when I think, 
             "Wait a minute!  I can't walk into that lobby alone, what if 
             my ex-boyfriend's here?"  So I agree to drive up with _Simon_.  
             There I am, standing on the curb with my garment bag and what  
             does he pull up in?  Your father's Winnebago!  
    _She gets her drink from the bartender._
        **Roz:** Thank you.  Don't go anywhere. [_to the others_] Next thing 
             I know, we're headed down the highway, in the wrong direction, 
             towards the airport.
    
    _The bartender turns away._
    
        **Roz:** Hey!  I wasn't kidding. [_to Daphne_] Turns out he's promised 
             to ferry your entire family up here.
     **Daphne:** All fourteen of them?
        **Roz:** Fifteen.  Your Aunt Ida got the weekend off from the bakery.  
             Judging by the size of her, it'll be the first Saturday they 
             turn a profit.
    **Frasier:** You know, Donny, maybe you could take Roz out for a walk in 
             that rejuvenating country air?  While I have a word with 
             your fiancee?
      **Donny:** Come on Roz, let's go.
    _Roz grabs the bottle the bartender is pouring from._
        **Roz:** You don't mind if I just take this with me, do you?
    **Barkeep:** Well, uh...
        **Roz:** I didn't think so.  
    _She and Donny exit.  Frasier and Daphne sit at a table._
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I wanted you to know that I am just completely 
             devastated by what happened.
     **Daphne:** It's all right, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** It's just that when I advised you to have a chat with Niles, 
             I had no idea that he'd run off and get married.
     **Daphne:** I know you're concerned for me, but I'm fine.  I thought about 
             it all last night and I realize that what I was feeling was 
             just wedding jitters.  I do love your brother, but I'm in love 
             with Donny.
    **Frasier:** You're not just putting on a brave face?
     **Daphne:** No.  I'm a bit embarrassed now, making you worry for no 
             reason...
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's all right, Daphne.  It's what I do.
     **Daphne:** You've always been such a wonderful friend.  In fact, 
             I brought this for the honeymoon, [_takes the '45 Petrus 
             out of her bag_] but I'd like you to have it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne, I couldn't.
     **Daphne:** No, Donny and I aren't wine drinkers.
    **Frasier:** I wouldn't dream of it, really.
     **Daphne:** All right then, I'll keep it.
    **Frasier:**[_reaching out_] Oh, now I've hurt your feelings.  Here... 
             [_They laugh_] Oh gosh, Daphne.  I tell you what: I promise 
             that when I do drink this, I'll be thinking of you.
     **Daphne:** Oh, come here.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daph...  
    _As they hug, an elderly woman comes in behind them._
        **Mum:** There's my baby!
     **Daphne:** Mummy! 
    _She runs over and hugs her._
     **Daphne:** Mum, this is...
        **Mum:** Oh, I know who he is, love. [_To Frasier_] I want to thank you, 
             Donny, for rescuing my daughter from that horrible Dr. Crane.  
    **Frasier:** Well, actually...
        **Mum:** Every time I call her, I'm not on the phone five minutes, 
             before that tyrant is ordering her to hang up. [_To bartender_] 
             Cup of tea, please.  Thought my daughter might get me one, 
             but she didn't. [_She sits_] Oh, this seat's worse than that 
             Winnebago!  Though not half as uncomfortable as that sardine-
             tin of a room you arranged for me.  
    _Frasier brings her tea._
        **Mum:** Oh, God, can't bear the smell of that, take it away.  
             Reminds me of the salmon they served on that airplane. 
             Oh, if it doesn't have me hurling me guts out, it'll 
             be by God's own intervention.  Now, give your new mom 
             a kiss, Donny.
     **Daphne:** Actually, Mum, this isn't Donny.
      **Donny:**[_entering_] Oh, is this Mum?  
     **Daphne:** This is Donny!
      **Donny:** Hi!
        **Mum:** Well, come here, let's have a good look at you. [_To Frasier_] 
             We were starting to think our Daphne would never find herself 
             a young man. [_Looks at Donny_] And I see she hasn't.  But, 
             beggars can't be choosers. [_Gets up_] Well, I'm gonna see if 
             your father's stomach is feeling any better.  He keeps saying 
             it's tension!  What he's got to be tense about, I'll never 
             know.
    _She leaves, the others look at each other._
     **Daphne:**[_cheerfully_] I was worried she'd be in one of her dark moods.
    _FADE OUT._
    **THE REHEARSAL DINNER**
    _Scene Two - The Lounge - Evening
    
    FADE IN:
    Frasier is sitting at the bar.  Martin and Donny come in from the 
    dining area.  Other guests can be heard through the doors._
      **Donny:** Boy, Daphne's brothers know how to let loose, don't they?
     **Martin:** I'll say.  Now listen, about their names: the one who'll 
             eat anything on a bet, that's Nigel...
      **Donny:** No, no, that's Peter.  Nigel's the one whose band-aid he ate.  
             See you later.  
    _He leaves and Martin goes to the bar._
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras.  Had enough?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah.  I think I hit my limit when I looked down in 
             the middle of my toast and there was a man chewing on my 
             boutonni�re.
     **Martin:** Ah, God, it's been a hell of a week.  I STILL can't get over 
             Niles and Mel.
    **Frasier:** Didn't see that one coming.
     **Martin:** Well, at least he say she makes him happy.  So, there's 
             nothin' you can do about it, right?
    **Frasier:** Actually...
     **Martin:** Fras!  Don't even think about trying to talk him out of it.  
             He's married, end of story.
    **Frasier:** It's really not that simple Dad.  You see... Ah, I shouldn't 
             be talking to you about this.
     **Martin:** Is this about Daphne?
    **Frasier:** Why do you say that?
     **Martin:** Oh, come on.  I've got eyes, I know something's going on.  
             I've seen the way she's been looking at him.
    **Frasier:** She found out how Niles has felt about her all these years.
     **Martin:** You're kidding!  How'd she find out?
    **Frasier:** That's not important right now, Dad.  The problem is that she 
             told me she thinks she might have the same feelings for him.
     **Martin:** Oh, geez...
    **Frasier:** 'Course then Niles shows up married, now she says it's 
             just jitters.
     **Martin:** Well, you can't tell Niles all this, he says he's happy 
             with Mel.
    **Frasier:** She says she's happy with Donny.  But I'm not sure I believe 
             either one of them.
     **Martin:** Just remember Fras, there are two marriages on the line here.  
             So, before you get involved, you better make damn sure you 
             know what you're doing. 
    _They sit in silence for a moment._
     **Martin:** Who blabbed?  Roz?
    **Frasier:** Yes, but she feels terrible.
    _Simon enters with his sleeves rolled up.  He pats the boys on the back,
    also drying his wet hands on their jackets._
      **Simon:** Hello, boys!  Pack of smokes, please, barkeep.  Ah, lovely 
             spot, isn't it?  I just took a nice little stroll outside, 
             around the wishing well.
    **Barkeep:** That'll be four dollars, please.
      **Simon:** Oh, yeah, right. 
    _He pulls a bunch of coins out of his pockets and drops them on the bar._
      **Simon:** This oughta cover it.
    _Roz comes in from the dining room with a young man in tow._
        **Roz:** Tim!  What a surprise!  I had no idea you'd be here.  Simon?  
             Come here.
      **Simon:** Oh, showtime.  
    _He grabs Frasier's drink and goes over._
        **Roz:** Simon, this is my old friend Tim.  He's a computer programmer.
      **Simon:** Oh, what a coincidence, with me owning my own software company.
        **Tim:** Really?  What sort of applications are you focused on?
      **Simon:** Voice recognition, data encryption, a little something 
             I'm working on for NASA, can't discuss that one.
        **Tim:** Very impressive.  And Roz?  Are you still producing?
      **Simon:** Oh, I'll say she is! 
    _He gives her a smack on the behind.  She gives him a shocked glare and 
    they go into the dining area.  Tim goes out the front as Daphne and 
    Donny enter._
      **Donny:** Mind if we join you guys?
     **Martin:** Sure.
    **Frasier:** Please, there's plenty of room.
     **Martin:**[_to bartender_] Uh, give me a beer, please
     **Daphne:** Sorry we didn't get a toast out of you, Mr. Crane.
     **Martin:** Oh, I'm sorry.  I really wanted to, Daphne, but I just felt 
             kind of awkward.
     **Daphne:** Oh, It's all right.  Anyway, I should be toasting you.  
             I'm gonna miss you, you rotten old sod.
    **Barkeep:** Ballantine okay?
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, that's my beer!  
    _The bartender gives him a mug._
     **Martin:** Yes.  You know, I just found out they're gonna quit making 
             this stuff?
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** There's the end of an era.
     **Martin:** That's right.  It's gonna be one sad day when I get down to 
             my last one.  You know, it's funny.  You get used to having 
             something in your life.  It's part of your day, you just 
             take it for granted.  Then, suddenly it's gone and you 
             realize how much it meant to you.  
    _Daphne, moved, puts her hand on his arm, Martin makes a little 
    "Oh, go on" gesture.
    
    Niles enters from the dining area with Mel._
      **Niles:** Hey, guys!  Great party.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Mel, why don't you take my seat, I'm going to sit here 
             and just enjoy the music.
     **Martin:** I'll join you, Fras.  Take my beer over there?  I just 
             want to go to the rest room.
    _Frasier takes the beer to a table, as Martin exits._
      **Donny:** You know, seeing as how this is my last night as a carefree 
             bachelor, [_to Mel_] would you care to dance, Miss?
        **Mel:** I'd love to.
      **Niles:** Uh, oh. 
    _Mel and Donny go to the dance floor, Niles sits down next to 
    Daphne._
      **Niles:** Well, you certainly picked the perfect spot for your 
             wedding.
     **Daphne:** It is, isn't it?  We're doing the ceremony in the garden.
      **Niles:** Mmm, it'll be beautiful.
    _A moment of silence._
     **Daphne:** I love this song.
      **Niles:** Well, where are my manners?  Would you like to dance?
     **Daphne:** All right!  Give us a chance to keep an eye on those two.
    _They go to the floor and start dancing.  As the scene progresses 
    they get closer and smoother._
      **Niles:** Ahh, it's been a while since we danced together.
     **Daphne:** Yes, it has.
      **Niles:** Thanks for dinner.  It's been a wonderful evening.
     **Daphne:** It's one of those times you just don't want to end.
    _They end up cheek to cheek, almost melting in each others arms, 
    just as the number finishes._
      **Donny:** Excuse me, sir.  Mind if I cut in?
      **Niles:** Not at all.
      **Donny:** Thank you.  
    _He and Daphne begin to dance._
      **Niles:** Darling. 
    _He and Mel begin to dance.
    
    Frasier has been watching this and sees Niles glance at Daphne then, 
    as he turns away, Daphne look at Niles.
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT THREE
    
    ACT FOUR
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Hotel Room
    
    FADE IN:
    
    In Frasier's hotel room, which has connecting doors to those of 
    Donny/Daphne and Niles/Mel.  A draped door leads to a balcony.  
    There are twin beds with wing chairs at the foot of each.  The 
    door opens and Frasier and Niles come in._
      **Niles:** What in the world was so urgent that you brought me all the 
             way up here?
    **Frasier:** Niles, just sit down.  There's something I need to discuss 
             with you.  
    _They sit down on the beds facing each other._
    **Frasier:** I was watching you on the dance floor just now, and the look 
             in your eyes was unmistakable.
      **Niles:** Well, can you blame me?  Mel's quite the little dancer.  Of 
             course her vertigo rules out any serious twirling, but...
    **Frasier:** Niles, I'm talking about Daphne.  The way you were looking 
             at her... well, it just breaks my heart.
      **Niles:** Frasier, it was one thing when you were beating this drum 
             the other day, but I'm married now.  What's it going to 
             take to convince you that I am over her?
    **Frasier:** She knows.
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** Daphne knows that you have feelings for her.  She's known 
             for some time. 
      **Niles:** How?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a long story. but... I think Roz said something.  
             Anyway, she knows!
      **Niles:** I knew you thought my marriage to Mel was hasty, but to 
             poison it like this... [_He gets up and heads for the door_]  
             I'm not going to listen to this.
    **Frasier:** Niles, Daphne feels the same way about you!  
    _Niles turns, stunned._
    **Frasier:** At least I think she does.  She told me as much the other day 
             and then denied once you got married.  But I saw the way she 
             was looking at you downstairs just now.
      **Niles:** Oh, my God.
    **Frasier:** Niles, I'm not in the habit of breaking up people's marriages.  
             But how could I not tell you?  You're my brother, I love you.  
    _There is a knock at the door._
        **Mel:**[_from outside_] Niles, darling?
      **Niles:**[_opening the door_] Yes, honey.
        **Mel:** You left with our only room key.
      **Niles:** Here, I'll let you through this way.  I am so sorry.
        **Mel:** Oh, it's all right.  You have a whole lifetime to make 
             it up to me.
    _She kisses him and goes into their room.  Niles closes the door behind 
    her and begins gasping for air.  He is in full-blown, hyperventilating 
    panic-attack mode.  He staggers to a chair and sits._
      **Niles:** This is awful.  I love Mel.  It's just...
    **Frasier:** I know, I know...
      **Niles:**[_thinks for a moment_] I have to talk to Daphne.  Come with me.  
             Maybe while I'm speaking to her, you can find some way to 
             occupy - [_they open the door, revealing -_] Donny!  Daphne!
      **Donny:** Hey, doc.  Things are getting a little too wild for us down 
             there.
      **Niles:** Oh well, it's just as well.  We all have a very big day 
             tomorrow.  About that, Daphne could I have a word with you?
     **Daphne:** All right.
      **Donny:** Yeah, you go ahead.  I'm just gonna get out of these shoes 
             and I'll see you in a few minutes.  
    _He goes off to their room._
    **Frasier:** You know, I'll just brave the hordes, see if I can't get 
             myself a nightcap.  Uh, good night.  
    _He leaves, Daphne enters._
      **Niles:** So, Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Yes?
      **Niles:** May I offer you something to drink?
     **Daphne:** Um, no thank you.
      **Niles:** Oh, all right.  Anyway, Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Perhaps an Orangina.
      **Niles:** Oh, all right, maybe I'll join you.
     **Daphne:**[_sitting in one of the chairs_] Funny thing about Orangina: 
             I never buy Orangina at home, but whenever I'm in a hotel 
             and there's a mini-bar, it's the first thing I go for.  
             Orangina... 
    _Niles has gotten two bottles from the mini-bar and gives her one.  
    He sits in the other chair so they are side by side and not facing 
    each other._
      **Niles:** Anyway, I was just talking to Frasier about a conversation 
             you two had.
     **Daphne:** Oh, dear!
      **Niles:** No, no.  Don't get upset.
     **Daphne:** I specifically asked him not to say anything.  What was he 
             thinking? 
    _She gets up and goes to the desk by the main door._
      **Niles:**[_getting up to follow her_] No, I'm glad he told me.  
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes!  So we can have a big talk about it!  That's what 
             you psychiatrists always do, drag everything out into the 
             open so we can work through it.  No matter how awkward it 
             might be.  Well, I just don't see the point!
      **Niles:** No, Daphne, I'm glad he told me - because I love you.
    _Daphne is stunned.  Then Martin comes through the door, with 
    wet hair._
     **Martin:** Ah, excuse me.
      **Niles:** Dad...
     **Martin:** Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were in here with Frasier.  
             The boys are playing a game called "William Tell" with the 
             seltzer hose. 
    _He laughs, then finally sees Daphne._
     **Martin:** Oh.  Uh, well, anyway... why don't you two go on doing whatever 
             you were doing and I'll just, uh, I'll be down in the lobby.  
             By the fireplace.  
    _He leaves._
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, you shouldn't say such things.
      **Niles:** It's the truth.  Lord knows, I have tried to deny it, tried 
             to pretend that I am over you, but not a day has gone by 
             when I haven't thought of you.  Your smile, your beautiful 
             eyes, what it would be like to hold your hands and ask you 
             the question I never dared ask!
      **Donny:**[_coming through the connecting door_] What's the difference 
             between a blister and a boil?
     **Daphne:** Donny!
      **Donny:** God, I took my shoe off and it was like I was growing another 
             ankle bone down here.  Doc, you went to med school, what am I 
             supposed to do with this?  Lance it or something?
      **Niles:** Oh, well, I.  You know, as I recall the best thing for that  
             would be to soak it in tepid water for at least half an 
             hour.
      **Donny:** All right.   What luck!  Can you imagine a worse thing to 
             have happen to me on the night before my wedding? 
    _He leaves._
     **Daphne:** I don't understand!  How come you never said anything before?
      **Niles:** Daphne, I wanted to.  I just... the timing just never seemed 
             right.
     **Daphne:** Oh, and the timing's right now?  I'm twelve hours from the 
             altar and you're on your honeymoon!
      **Niles:** I would never have gotten married if I thought there was the 
             slightest chance that you shared my feelings.  Trust me,
             Daphne, say the word and I will leave Mel in a heartbeat.
        **Mel:**[_coming through HER connecting door_] Niles?
      **Niles:** Darling!
        **Mel:** I was just looking over these brochures for our honeymoon.  
             Hi Daphne! [_To Niles_] Now, the Denali has a step-down tub, 
             but the Greeley has the most romantic view of the Grand Canal.  
             What do you think?
      **Niles:** I think a woman with your exquisite taste can handle this 
             decision.
        **Mel:**[_to Daphne_] Oh, he says that now.  Wait 'til the honeymoon's 
             over.  
    _She leaves._
     **Daphne:** Don't the doors in this bloody place lock?!
      **Niles:** I'll get this one, you get that one.  
    _They lock the connecting doors, Niles locks the main door._
      **Niles:** Daphne?  It is not too late for us.  I meant what I said 
             when I said I would leave her.
     **Daphne:** That's crazy!
      **Niles:** No, no, it's NOT crazy.  Not if you feel the same way I do.  
             But I need you to tell me, and I can accept it if the answer 
             is "No."  How do you feel about me?
    _Simon comes in the main door._
      **Simon:** Pardon.
     **Daphne:** Simon!  How did you get in here?
      **Simon:** Well, Frasier loaned me his key, in a manner of speaking.  
    _He opens the mini-bar and begins grabbing bottles._
      **Simon:** I have to get some things from the mini-bar, here.  Don't 
             want to get caught empty-handed when last call comes.  
    _He looks from Daphne to Niles and back._
      **Simon:** You're not havin' a last call of your own in here, are you, 
             Stilts?
     **Daphne:** Of course not!
      **Simon:** Riiight.  This isn't the chap whose baby you're havin', is it?
      **Niles:** Excuse me?!
     **Daphne:** I'm not pregnant!
      **Nigel:**[_coming in the door_] Oi, Simon!  Bit o' bad news.
     **Daphne:** Nigel!
      **Nigel:** Peter's gotten sick into the piano, so we've been asked 
             to vacate the bar.
      **Simon:** Bloody hell, Daphne!  Nice hotel you picked!   Well Nigel, 
             I'm sure Daphne won't mind if we help ourselves to the 
             contents of her mini-bar.  'Way you go.
      **Nigel:** Right. [_Shouting down the hall_] Give us a hand, lads! 
     **Daphne:** Nigel-!
    _A veritable horde comes pouring through the door -- Daphne's brothers,
    followed by Mum and some other guests.
    _
     **Daphne:** Stephen, Peter, David, Michael, Billy!  What are you all 
             doing in here?
        **Mum:** So here you all are.  What is the point of bringing the party 
             down to the Winnebago when there's a perfectly nice room 
             right here?  
    _Niles slips out the balcony door._
     **Daphne:** You're not moving the party in here!  
        **Mum:** Oh, Daphne, don't get your blood pressure up!  You've got 
             your baby to think of.  Here, have a drink and relax. 
    _Daphne heads for the balcony.
    
    CUT TO: the balcony.  
    Niles is standing at the rail, looking out.  Daphne comes through 
    the door behind him._
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry about all that.
      **Niles:** I must be in love.  It doesn't even bother me that you come 
             with them.  Lovely night isn't it?
     **Daphne:** Mmm.
      **Niles:** The stars are out, nice breeze, [_he inhales deeply_] mmm, 
             night-blooming jasmine.  Of course there's the beautiful 
             girl...
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, I still haven't answered your question.
      **Niles:** Yes, I know.  That's why I keep talking.  In case I don't 
             get the answer I want, I can at least make this moment 
             last a little longer. [_Then, for a moment his old fussy
             self_] Not sure if it's jasmine or orange blossoms.  You 
             know, a lot of times...
     **Daphne:** Oh, for God's sake, Dr. Crane!  
    _She throws herself at him and kisses him deeply._
      **Niles:**[_as the kiss breaks_] I think you can call me "Niles" now.  
    _He leans in and they kiss again.  Then Daphne brings her hands down 
    and pushes back._
     **Daphne:**[_shaking her head_] No.  I don't think I can.  I do love you, 
             but I can't do this. 
      **Niles:** Wh-, whe-, uh... I know it will be difficult, but I will 
             get a divorce, and you can call off the wedding.
     **Daphne:** I can't!  Donny is a dear and wonderful man, and I made a 
             promise to him.  And Mel!  You made more than a promise to 
             her!  And we're supposed to forget that?  And for what?  
             We have no idea how we'd be together.  For heaven's sake, 
             we've never even been on a date.
      **Niles:** Daphne, take it from someone who knows: you don't want to 
             spend half your life thinking about a chance you didn't 
             take.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry.  My mind's made up.  I think we should say good 
             night now.
    _Niles obviously wants to say more, but knows it's too late._
      **Niles:**[_finally says_] Good night, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Good night, Dr. Crane.  
    _She goes back in, leaving Niles standing alone.  
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    Scene Two - The Winnebago.
    
    FADE IN:
    
    Niles, looking VERY dejected, is sitting in the driver's seat of 
    the Winnebago.  The door opens and Frasier and Martin come in._
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Don't tell me the ceremony's over already.
     **Martin:** Oh, no, it hasn't even started yet.
    **Frasier:** Actually, we saw you heading over this way and we thought 
             you could use some company.
      **Niles:** I just felt like some privacy.  This is one wedding I couldn't 
             see myself handling very well.
     **Martin:** Ah, lots of people cry at weddings.
      **Niles:** Yeah, but not so many end up wailing and rending their 
             garments.  I appreciate your coming over but I'd hate 
             for you to miss it on my account.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually it's been delayed a bit.  You see, the justice 
             of the peace started out asking the witnesses to step forward, 
             and three of Daphne's brothers just ran off into the woods.  
    _He chuckles.  There is a knock on the door._
    **Frasier:** Ah.  
    _He opens the door.  A waiter is there.  He is carrying a tray with the 
    '45 Petrus and three glasses._
    **Frasier:** Hello.
     **Waiter:** Here's your wine, sir.  
    **Frasier:** Yes, thank you very much, young man. [_tipping him_] And this is 
             for you.  Thank you.
    
    _The waiter leaves._
    
      **Niles:** What is this?
    **Frasier:** Well, I got to thinking about our old friend Morrie and 
             how he kept this bottle of wine his entire life, waiting 
             for a special occasion.  And then I thought, "What occasion 
             am I saving it for?"  And then I thought about what a 
             courageous thing you did last night, taking that chance.  
             And that's worth a toast. [_Starts to open the wine_]
      **Niles:** No, no, Frasier, don't...
    **Frasier:** No, too late, the foil is pierced.
     **Martin:** I know this thing between you and Mel seems kinda bad right 
             now...
      **Niles:** Oh, Dad, why do you say that?  Just because I spent the 
             third night of my marriage proposing to another woman?
     **Martin:** Well, I'm just saying a marriage can survive all kinds of 
             stuff.  You know?  You might still be happy.  Ten years 
             from now, this could all be ancient history.
      **Niles:** I hope you're right.
    **Frasier:** All right gentlemen, here we are now.  [_Passes out the wine_] 
             Dad, Niles, allow me. [_Raises his glass_] To better days. 
    _They clink glasses and sip.  All of them make confused, unhappy faces._
      **Niles:** Dad, where did Morrie keep this?
     **Martin:** In his wine rack.
    **Frasier:** Which is...?
     **Martin:** In the boiler room.
    **Frasier:** Oh, lord.  I'll just save this little treat for later.
      **Niles:** Yes, well, thanks for the thought.  You two should be 
             running along.  I'll be fine.
     **Martin:** All right.  Well, take care, Niles.
    **Frasier:** You know, I saw a waiter, passing champagne just outside.  
             I'll have him bring you a glass so you can...
      **Niles:** Get the taste out, yes.  Thank you, Frasier.
    _Frasier and Martin exit.  Niles leans back in the seat, once again 
    looking very melancholy.  There is a knock at the door._
      **Niles:** Come in.
    _The door opens and Daphne, in her wedding dress, steps in._
     **Daphne:** Hello.
      **Niles:**[_rising_] Daphne...
     **Daphne:** I was wondering... if you might be free for a date?
      **Niles:**[_rushing to embrace her_] Oh, my God, yes!
     **Daphne:**[_separating them_] There's plenty of time for that later.  
             Let's get this bloody boat moving!
    _Daphne rushes to the front passenger seat and Niles helps her with 
    the skirts and train of her dress._
      **Niles:** What, you mean now?
     **Daphne:** There's about a hundred people back there I'm not so keen on 
             seeing.
      **Niles:**[_giddy_] Well, all right, let's go then.
    _He sits in the driver's seat and starts the engine, then grabs for 
    the safety belt._
      **Niles:** Fasten your seat belt, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Fasten yours, Niles.
    _Niles looks at her, puts the Road Warrior in gear, grabs the wheel 
    and pulls away, as we:
    
    FADE OUT._
    [_N.B. Two alternate versions of this ending were written and filmed -- 
    the other going the opposite way.  Both were shown to the episode's 
    live studio audience, who, unsurprisingly, preferred this one._]
