    _ACT ONE
    Scene One -- Wine Club
    Niles, wearing his Corkmaster's ribbon, is at the podium as the members 
    finish applauding Reynolds, another member, holding a trumpet._
    
       **Niles:** Thank you, thank you, Brother Reynolds, for your inaugural ode, 
              and may I congratulate you on your ingenuity in rhyming 
              "Sauvignon" with "tie one on."
    **Reynolds:**[_with a sycophantic salute_] Sir.
       **Niles:** And now, as outgoing Corkmaster it is my privilege [_takes 
              ribbon off_] to bestow the sash of office upon the newly-
              elected Corkmaster... which would be me! [_puts ribbon back 
              on, to applause_] Thank you, thank you, thank you for your 
              support.  It humbles me, and I only hope to live up to the 
              shining example of my predecessor. [_laughter_] And of course 
              the example of my opponent, the other brother Crane, who so 
              graciously conceded after that fourth recount.  Is he - is he 
              here?  I guess he's not.  Well, I'm sure he's with us in 
              spirit.  Uh, if you'll indulge me, I've cobbled together a few 
              remarks to express what this moment means to me-
    _Frasier clambers down the stairs, acting embarrassed but obviously 
    making as much noise as he can._
    
     **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  Oh God, I'm terribly sorry I'm late!  
              Oh, it's just coming down in buckets out there!
       **Niles:** Hello, Frasier. [_resumes_] Just as the cork protects the wine, 
              as Corkmaster I hope to protect the wine club from the forces 
              of metaphorical oxidation-
     **Frasier:** Oh lord, Niles, are you in the middle of your inauguration 
              speech?  I'm so sorry.
       **Niles:** That's all right, that's all right.
     **Frasier:** It's just that I have an announcement of my own to make.
       **Niles:** Yes well, uh, new business is concluded, Brother Crane.
     **Frasier:** I move that we re-open new business.
    **Reynolds:** Second.
       **Niles:** Denied. [_bangs gavel_]
     **Frasier:** Point of order: once a motion has been seconded, there must 
              be a vote.
       **Niles:** Oh, all right, just tell us your new business.
     **Frasier:** To override procedure, there must be a quorum.
       **Niles:** Very well.  Move for a vote?
    **Reynolds:** Second.
       **Niles:** All in favor?
     **Members:** Aye!
       **Niles:** Motion carried. [_bangs gavel_] Secretary, make a note.
    **Reynolds:** Noted, Corkmaster.
       **Niles:** Thank you so much. [_to Frasier_] Proceed.
    **Endicott:**[_a member, to himself_] I remember when we used to come here 
              to drink.
    
    _Frasier stands next to the podium._
    
    **Frasier:** Corkmaster, members of the wine cabinet, esteemed brothers 
             and sisters, I come here tonight with a heavy heart.  You see, 
             I am resigning from the wine club.
    
    _There are gasps and moans of dismay._
    
       **Niles:** Frasier, this wouldn't have anything to do with my winning 
              the election, would it?
     **Frasier:** No, no, of course not, Niles, I couldn't be happier for you.  
              You see, I've been afforded a marvelous opportunity to pass 
              on what I've learned here to a much larger audience.  
              Starting next week I will be hosting a new feature on KACL, 
              called "the Wine Corner," just at the end of Gil Chesterton's 
              "Restaurant Beat." [_applause_] Thank you, thank you.
    **Reynolds:** Can't you do both?
     **Frasier:** Oh well, no, regrettably no.  You see, like this Camembert, 
              I am at my most delicious when I'm not spread too thin.  
              But this isn't goodbye by any stretch of the imagination.  
              Please, I invite each and every one of you to call into my 
              show, so that you can help me get Seattle hooked on our 
              sometimes whimsical, always enlightened brand of discussion.  
              But, I've taken enough time away from Niles.  After all, 
              this is his night.  He has been elected Corkmaster of this 
              fine club.
       **Niles:** Thank you, Frasier.  For a moment I thought you were settling 
              in for a long farewell speech.
    **Reynolds:** Second.
     **Frasier:** All in favor?
     **Members:** Aye!
     **Frasier:** Well, if you insist! [_takes podium_] It was a short seven 
              years ago, on a night very much like this one, a man had a 
              dream...
    _Niles, swept to the side, morosely caresses his Corkmaster medal.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **OENOLOGY FOR DUMMIES**
    
    _Scene Two -- KACL
    Frasier heads down the hall with Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, Roz, now this is a very different kind of show 
             we're going to be doing, so are you clear on the procedure?
        **Roz:** What's so hard?  You talk for a while, I screen calls, you 
             answer them, I look interested -- oh, I see the hard part.
    **Frasier:** Oh, ha-ha, very funny.  All right, now listen, this is a list 
             of the members of the wine club. [_hands it to her_] If any of 
             these names should happen to call, put them through 
             immediately, and then fasten your seat belt for an all-out, 
             free-wheeling symposium!
    
    _Kenny comes into the hall._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, there's my Renaissance man!
    **Frasier:** Ah, Kenny!
      **Kenny:** If he can't solve their problems with therapy, solve 'em with 
             drinking!
    **Frasier:** Yes well, let's just keep that out of the ads, shall we?
      **Kenny:** Heh-heh, too late! 
    **Frasier:** Kenny!
    
    _In the booth, Gil is doing his show with his new producer, 
    an effeminate slip of a lad called Lance._
    
        **Gil:** And finally, no review of Le Petite Oiseau would be complete 
             without a word about their decor: hideous!  I'll be back after 
             these messages.
      **Lance:**[_singsong_] And we're out!
    
    _Kenny brings Roz and Frasier into the producer's booth._
    
      **Kenny:** Hi, Lance.  This is Frasier, and this is Roz.  She'll be 
             producing the rest of the show.
        **Roz:** Hi. [_extends her hand_]
      **Lance:** Oh, my! [_ignores it_] Isn't that interesting?
        **Roz:** Yes well, Frasier wants me to produce his segment of the show.  
             We have to get the levels just right to accommodate the timbre 
             of his voice.
      **Lance:** Oh, my, my, my, isn't she the fusspot!
    **Frasier:** Actually, it was my idea.
      **Lance:** That's who I was talking about!
    
    _Frasier goes into the broadcast booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Listen, Gil, I-I hope you don't mind my doing this segment.
        **Gil:** Oh, perish the thought!  I'm ecstatic - as ecstatic as you 
             would be if someone hijacked the last fifteen minutes of 
             your show.
    
    _Roz comes in._
    
        **Roz:** Hey Gil, what is the deal with Lance?
        **Gil:** Oh, smitten already, are we, Roz?  Well, he's certainly catnip 
             to the ladies.
        **Roz:** No, that would- [_confused_] Really?
        **Gil:** Well, that's what he claims.  Of course, I've never actually 
             seen him with a woman.  Well, just between us I've always 
             thought he went the other way.
        **Roz:**[_more confused_] Which way would that be?
      **Lance:** And we're back!
        **Gil:**[_into mike_] Normally at this time I'd be doing my segment on 
             food for the calorie-conscious, "All Things Light and Edible."  
             But apparently health is going to take a backseat to the 
             random musings of a radio psychiatrist on wine.  So without 
             further ado, I give you "The Wine Corner," with your host, 
             Dr. Frasier Crane.
    
    _Gil slaps his headphones down on the console and leaves the booth 
    with Lance.  Frasier and Roz assume their positions._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Gil, for that gracious introduction.  And hello, 
             Seattle!  Welcome to "The Wine Corner."  I hope you're as 
             excited about this new program as I am.  I offer myself as 
             sherpa -- a guide, if you will, to lead you through the 
             labyrinth of vintages and wine lists, chateaus and bodegas, 
             and take you hopefully to a whole new level of sophistication...
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- Fifteen minutes later.
    Frasier is wrapping up his segment.  The wind has all but gone out 
    of his sails._
    
    **Frasier:** In summary, Linda, the year listed on the bottle is not an 
             expiration date.  So that wine from 1997 should be perfectly 
             safe to drink. [_disconnects_] Who else, Roz?
        **Roz:** We have ten seconds, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** In that case, this is Frasier Crane, reminding you that 
             a great wine is like a great woman: always intoxicating, 
             ever-surprising, and only getting better with age.
    
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes in._
    
        **Roz:** Aww, do you really believe that?
    **Frasier:** Oh, who cares, Roz?  I stopped listening to myself ten minutes 
             ago.  You're sure no one from the wine club called?
        **Roz:** I'm positive.  Don't feel bad, you got a lot of other callers.
    **Frasier:** It's just that I was hoping to provoke the same kind of
             spirited debates we have at the wine club!  No holds barred 
             free-for-alls!  Sometimes go into the wee hours of the night 
             and even spill out into the streets. [_mournful_] Oh, Roz, 
             we loved wine then.
    
    _Gil and Lance come in._
    
        **Gil:** Huzzah, Frasier!  I'm sure everyone who was listening is 
             hitting the bottle as we speak.  Well, Lance and I are going 
             for a boys' night out.
      **Lance:**[_with a twirly hand motion_] Lock up your daughters!
    
    _They leave.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Apartment
    Martin is in his Chair, reading the paper.  Frasier is at the dinner 
    table with a laptop and a bottle of white wine.  He carefully takes 
    a mouthful, swishes it around, then swallows and sucks in his breath 
    sharply.  Then he types._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, tell me if you think this is too subtle for my listening 
             audience. [_Martin puts his paper down_] "This delightful 
             offering is infused with the brooding, almost dangerous, 
             presence of vanilla."
     **Martin:** No, it's not too subtle.  Unless you want them to know what 
             the hell you're talking about.
    **Frasier:** Well, you don't think it's clear that I enjoyed the wine?
     **Martin:** I don't it's clear you're talking about wine.
    
    _Doorbell._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh lord, that'll be the new therapist.
     **Martin:** Oh, lucky me.
    **Frasier:** Oh now, behave yourself, Dad.  It's only until Daphne comes 
             back.  And besides, you have no idea how difficult it is to 
             find a therapist who can also cook.  Her name is Frederika.
     **Martin:** Oh, sounds German.  You know what that means -- she was 
             probably kicked off the shotput team for using steroids.
    **Frasier:** Now Dad, the Germans never threw anybody off the team for that.
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Frederika -- a strapping German woman with 
    blonde hair and a singsong accent._
    
      **Frasier:** Ah, hello.
    **Frederika:** Hi, I'm Frederika.
      **Frasier:** Won't you come in? [_she does_] Here, let me take your bag.  
               I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, and this is my father, Martin.  
               Here, let me take your coat. [_he does_]
    **Frederika:** Pleasure to meet you.
      **Frasier:** Listen, my father's been, well, letting his exercises slide 
               a bit.
    **Frederika:** Oh well, that's human nature, Dr. Crane.  People neglect 
               their exercising for many reasons -- holidays, travel, 
               illness, lack  of time, death... and there's only one of 
               those excuses that I accept: it's holidays! [_laughs_] 
               Oh, it's just your leg I'm pulling!
       **Martin:**[_laughs_] Oh, well, good one.  You know, I was worried that 
               you were going to be one of those drill-sergeant types.
    **Frederika:** You'll show me your exercise mat.
       **Martin:** That's my other leg you're pulling, huh?
    **Frederika:** Now!
    
    _Martin obeys, leading her to his room.  She follows with a strange, 
    undulating walk.  Frasier returns to the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes... [_sips, swishes, and sucks again; typing_] "But 
             discernible only to the educated palate is the hint of 
             violets that lingers like a haunting refrain..."
    _From Martin's room comes a howl of agony, as if from a heretic on the 
    Rack.  Frasier runs toward the hall when Frederika comes out._
    
    **Frederika:** Shame on you, Dr. Crane!  You really should have kept him 
               at his exercises.
      **Frasier:** Is he all right?
    **Frederika:** No, indeed!  He is shamefully out of shape!
      **Frasier:** But I meant-
    **Frederika:** But don't worry.  I got here just in time.  I'll shape him 
               up, or know the reason why!
    _She goes back into the hall.  Frasier, worried, is about to follow her, 
    but then the phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Oh yes, thank you for returning my call, Brother 
             Peabody.  Yes well, I'm just wondering, how come none of 
             the members have been calling my wine show? [_shocked_] No!  
             Well, just because Niles is Corkmaster, it doesn't mean he 
             has the right to dictate whom you may and may not call!  
             Good lord, the man is my own brother!  How can someone turn 
             his back on his own flesh and blood- [_Martin screams even 
             louder_] Someone on the phone here!
    _FADE TO:_
    **WHINE CLUB**
    
    _Scene Five -- Wine Club
    Niles is holding court._
    
    **Members:** Aye!
      **Niles:** It is so resolved, [_bangs gavel_] any other business?
    
    _Frasier storms down the stairs._
    
       **Niles:** Ah, former Brother Crane, what are you doing here?
     **Frasier:** You know very well.  How dare you instruct the members not 
              to call in to my radio show?
       **Niles:**[_indignant_] I simply directed their attention to Law 10-C, 
              which states that the club "shall not, through contract or 
              deed, endorse-"
     **Frasier:**[_with him_] "Any commercial endeavor," yes, yes, Niles, you 
              can hide behind some flimsy bylaw if you wish to for as 
              long as you like, but we both know the subtext behind this 
              pretext: vindictiveness!
       **Niles:** Oh!
     **Frasier:** In light of this abuse of power, I move that the Corkmaster 
              be stripped of his title! [_gasps from the members_] And that 
              some more well-deserving member be named in his stead!
       **Niles:** Oh, the motion fails for lack of a second.
    **Reynolds:** Second.
       **Niles:** Stop that!  Motion denied. [_bangs gavel_]
     **Frasier:** Point of order: a motion cannot be denied that has been 
              seconded!
       **Niles:** Yes well, the chair doesn't recognize motions from former 
              members, ergo there can be no second to a motion that 
              doesn't exist!
    **Endicott:** I move whatever it takes to get us to the bar!
    **Reynolds:** Second that.
       **Niles:** All right, the chair declares a state of emergency and a 
              five-second recess. [_bangs gavel_] Frasier, I want you out 
              of here.  It's bad enough you upstaged me the other night.
     **Frasier:** I did no such thing.
       **Niles:** Oh, _no_ , you could have picked any time to announce your 
              resignation, but you chose my inauguration to do it!
     **Frasier:** For God's sakes, Niles, will you listen to yourself!  
              This is just a wine club!
       **Niles:** "Just a wine club?"  That's not the platform you campaigned 
              on two years in a row!  Look, you can say anything you want 
              now, you know how important this place is to me.
     **Frasier:** Yes, and you know how important my radio show is to me.
       **Niles:** Oh well, I guess then we're even.
    
    _Beat._
    
    **Frasier:** So you admit it.  You have dishonored this club with your 
             selfishness!
      **Niles:** Yes well, at least I'm still _in_ the club!  You are a 
             trespasser!  Sergeant-at-Arms!
    _Virgil Hepplewhite, the club's elderly founder, rises slowly to his 
    feet and hobbles over to Frasier._
    
    **Hepplewhite:** We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
        **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] All right, call off your henchmen.
          **Niles:** Thank you, stand down, Brother Hepplewhite.
    
    _Hepplewhite sits down._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm just trying to save you from yourself, Niles.
      **Niles:** I see, well, goodbye, _former_ Brother.
    **Frasier:** You took the words right out of my mouth!
    
    _Frasier leaves.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Six -- Apartment
    Martin is tucking into a plate of German roast, with a glass stein of 
    beer next to his plate.
    
    Frasier shuffles in, seemingly at a loss._
    
    **Frasier:** Hi, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Anything good on TV tonight?
     **Martin:** I don't know, why?
    **Frasier:** Oh, got the night free.  Thought we might hang out together.
     **Martin:** Oh... that's nice.
    **Frasier:** Yeah, I usually have wine club on Wednesday nights.
     **Martin:** Oh.
    **Frasier:** What do you usually do Wednesday nights?
     **Martin:** Oh, just sit back, enjoy the silence.
    **Frasier:** Sounds good.
    
    _He sinks dolefully onto the couch._
    
    **Frasier:**[_checks his watch_] Seven-thirty... wonder what they're doing 
             at the wine club right now.
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez.  Are you gonna do this all night?
    **Frasier:** No, no, Dad, you're right, I-I'm sorry.  It's just that 
             I hate to see a once-proud institution making so many 
             foolish mistakes.
     **Martin:** Well, if it makes you feel any better, the club'll probably 
             fail without you.  It'll be no fun.  All the members'll 
             resign.  This time next month, they'll probably have torn the 
             building down.
    **Frasier:** I never know when you're being facetious.
     **Martin:** Yeah, you do.
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, let's talk about something else.  
             How's your physical therapy?
     **Martin:** Oh, it was the most painful afternoon of my life.  She did 
             things to me.  Bad things.
    **Frasier:** Well Dad, I suppose we could look for another therapist-
     **Martin:** Whup, hold on a second!  Here, [_takes a forkful of food from 
             his plate_] try this.
    
    _Frasier does -- it is delicious.  Martin laughs._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, that sauerbrauten is ambrosial!
     **Martin:** Oh, and wait 'til you wash it down with her papa's homemade 
             lager! [_takes a drink of beer_]
    
    _Frederika comes out of the kitchen._
    
    **Frederika:** How is everything?
      **Frasier:** Oh gosh, Frederika, I've never tasted anything so divine!
    **Frederika:** Oh, _ja_ , you see, Dr. Crane, I don't believe that fitness 
               depends on starving yourself.  The secret is exercise, hard 
               work, then good food and lots of it when you've earned it.
      **Frasier:** Oh well, this is fabulous food-
    
    _He reaches for another bite, but Frederika slaps his hand away._
    
    **Frederika:** You haven't earned it! 
    
    _Frasier is scared.  Then she laughs, and pinches his cheek._
    
    **Frederika:** That's just my way of having fun!  Of course you're welcome, 
               I'll get another plate.
      **Frasier:** Thank you.
    
    _She goes back to the kitchen.  Frasier is still rubbing his cheek, 
    trying to get some feeling back in it._
    
     **Martin:** We ought to get Niles over here, you know?  He'd love this 
             stuff!
    **Frasier:** Niles -- Dad, I told you Niles is no longer welcome in this 
             house. [_Frederika brings him a plate_] Thank you, Frederika.
     **Martin:** Oh son, why don't you just ask your brother to take you back?
    **Frasier:** I did.  I called him and I apologized.  He would hear none 
             of it.  All he did was keep quoting rules and bylaws.
     **Martin:** It's just like when you were kids with that fort!  You were 
             always making up these big fancy rules and titles for yourself 
             that always ended up in a fight!  I didn't like it then, and
             I don't like it now.
    **Frasier:** All right, Dad, then we just won't talk about it.  Besides, 
             I'm through with wine club.
     **Martin:** Good!  Why don't we just enjoy our Wednesday?
    **Frasier:** Second! [_to himself_] All in favor... aye... motion carried. 
             [_off Martin's look_] I'm done now.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven -- Wine Club
    Niles and other members are standing around, tasting wine._
    
       **Niles:** Mmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.  I'm getting oak with plummy overtones.
    **Endicott:** I'm getting screwed on alimony.
    
    _Martin comes down the stairs._
    
     **Martin:** Niles, I want to talk to you.
      **Niles:** Dad!  What happened, is there something wrong?
     **Martin:** You're damn right there is, it's about you and Frasier! 
             [_notices_] Good God, you wear a sash?!
      **Niles:** Frasier sent you down here, didn't he?
    **Frasier:**[_o.s. from above_] No!
     **Martin:** Frasier, get in here now!
    _Frasier shuffles in beside Niles.  The following scene is weirdly 
    similar to a father dressing down two toddlers -- a spectacle that 
    both Frasier and Niles are desperate to avoid._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, this isn't necessary.
      **Niles:** Yeah, we-we can talk about this some other time.
     **Martin:** Zip it up, both of you!  I just gave up the best meal of my 
             life to come down here, so listen up.  Niles, let your brother 
             play.
      **Niles:** Dad, this is not a game, this is a club, and Frasier broke 
             the rules!
    **Frasier:** Technically, I-
     **Martin:**[_silences him_] Well, then you write a new rule so that Frasier 
             can come back.
    **Frasier:** First, I want an apology-
     **Martin:** I said zip it!
      **Niles:** He did, I heard him!
     **Martin:** Don't get smart!  Now, are you gonna let your brother play?
      **Niles:** Dad-
     **Martin:** Are you gonna let your brother play?
      **Niles:** Why-
     **Martin:** Are you gonna let your brother play?
      **Niles:** I-
     **Martin:** Are you gonna let your brother play?
    
    _Niles has no choice._
    
      **Niles:** Fine.
     **Martin:** Am I gonna have any more trouble between you two?
    **Frasier/Niles:**[_humble_] No.
     **Martin:** No, what?
    **Frasier/Niles:** No, sir.
     **Martin:** Good.  Now shake hands. [_they do_] That's more like it.  Now if 
             you don't mind, I've got a big plate of _Gew�rzpl�tzchen_ waiting 
             for me at home with my name on it.
    
    _Martin leaves.  The whole wine club has watched this scene._
    
       **Niles:** Uh, well, [_chuckles_] let's get back to the wine, shall we?
    **Reynolds:** You got yelled at by your dad.
    
    _He giggles, and all the members laugh._
    
       **Niles:** Well, be that as it may-
    **Endicott:** Zip it!
    
    _Everyone laughs louder.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Eight -- Apartment
    Frasier opens the door to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.  I thought we could drive over to wine club 
             together.
    **Frasier:** Actually, I'm thinking about not going.
      **Niles:** Why not?
    **Frasier:** Niles, truth be told, my enthusiasm for the wine club has 
             started to turn.
      **Niles:** I know what you mean!  It used to be the wine club.  Now it's 
             just the teasing people club.
    **Frasier:** Then let's not go.
      **Niles:** Well, they'll put our names in the Absent bottle, we'll have 
             to bring the crackers next time.
    **Frasier:** What if there's no next time?
      **Niles:** What do you mean?
    **Frasier:** Niles, those people don't care about wine.
      **Niles:** Not the way you and I do, no!
    **Frasier:** So what's preventing us from starting a whole new club from 
             scratch?
      **Niles:** We could really get back to basics!
    **Frasier:** Something that's just about wine!  And a clear constitutional 
             procedure for enjoying it!
      **Niles:** Yes, only maybe this time the governing body could be 
             bicameral!
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know, Niles, there is something to be said for
             the parliamentary system!
      **Niles:** Well, either way we have to have a strong judiciary to keep 
             it in check.
    **Frasier:** God, I love wine.
    
    _END OF ACT TWO_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Apartment:
    Frasier and Niles are busy planning their new wine club.  Frasier has 
    even penned a charter on Constitutional parchment, with a quill pen.
    
    Niles has an idea that he wants to show Frasier.  He goes to the couch 
    and brings back a medal on a ribbon that looks suspiciously identical 
    to his old Corkmaster one.  Frasier wants to see it, but Niles won't 
    give it up.  They start to fight over it.
    
    Martin comes out of the kitchen angry.  He takes a pair of scissors 
    and cuts the ribbon in half, leaving Frasier with the medal and Niles 
    with the ribbon.  After he leaves, Frasier and Niles guiltily trade 
    off, and are happy at last._
