## Premise

    
    
     Frasier hires Ferguson, an authentic English butler, to take over 
     Daphne's household chores, improving both his lifestyle and his 
     stock in Seattle society.  However, Ferguson has some uncomfortable 
     insights about Niles and Daphne, even as it becomes clear that Mel 
     plans to string Niles along for as long as possible.

    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa
    FADE IN.
    Frasier is sitting at table reading the newspaper when Roz comes in.
    _
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, checking out the personal ads, huh?
    **Frasier:** Actually, I'm looking at the want ads.  I'm trying to find 
             a housekeeper.  Now that Daphne is Niles's girlfriend, it 
             doesn't feel right to ask her to pick up after me anymore, 
             so-
        **Roz:** Mmm.
    **Frasier:** Awfully difficult finding someone, though.
        **Roz:** It's hard getting what you want these days, isn't it?
    **Frasier:**[_a little wary_] Indeed.
        **Roz:** But you can still find convenience and value, if you know 
             where to look-
    **Frasier:** Dear God, what are you selling?
        **Roz:**[_produces a sample book of_] Wrapping paper!  It's a fundraiser 
             for Alice's school.
    **Frasier:** Well, at least it's a worthy cause.
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** All right, let's have a look. [_looks_] Oh, that one's 
             too garish... eh, don't like this one, either... ooh, 
             I'm certainly not crazy about bunnies...
        **Roz:** Oh, give me that! [_takes the book_] You're getting five rolls 
             of "Peace on Earth" and thanks for your support!
    
    _She leaves.  Niles comes in and goes to the counter._
    
      **Niles:**_Machiatto_... make it a _doup-iato._
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Niles please, whatever's wrong, the answer doesn't lie 
             at the bottom of an espresso cup.
    
    _He pulls Niles over to his table.  They sit._
    
      **Niles:** It's Mel again.
    **Frasier:** Oh, lord.  Still making you humiliate yourself at social 
             functions while she plays the long-suffering wife?
      **Niles:** I'm afraid so.  But she said a couple more weeks, and I'll 
             have my divorce.
    **Frasier:** She said that two weeks ago!  What was it this time?
      **Niles:** Well, we attended Colonel Turner's very large, very High 
             Episcopalian funeral, during the course of which my cell 
             phone rang repeatedly.  I was not allowed to answer it, 
             and Mel had set the ringer on "La Cucaracha."
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, I'm so sorry.
      **Niles:** Oh, it's all right.
    **Frasier:** No, I called you twice.
      **Niles:** Well, I ruined quite a sendoff, with an honor guard, 
             the colonel's butler seating people, _two_ archbishops-
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, did you just say "butler?"
      **Niles:** Oh yes, I know, an-an honest-to-goodness English butler.  
             The colonel was a bit of an anachronism.
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes.  That's amusing. [_they chuckle_] I suppose this butler 
             saw to the colonel's every need.
      **Niles:** Oh, oh - clipped his cigars, poured his scotch...
    **Frasier:** Laid out his clothes for him, and served him his meals...
    _Inspiration hits them together.  They stop talking and grab for their 
    cell phones._
    
      **Niles:** I saw him first!
    **Frasier:** You've had a gardener and a maid!
      **Niles:** Yes, but never a butler!
    **Frasier:** But it's my turn!
      **Niles:** But it's my dream!
    **Frasier:** Daphne won't have to clean anymore!
    
    _Niles smiles and folds his phone away._
    
      **Niles:** I tip my cap, sir.
    
    _Frasier smiles and dials his phone.  And we:
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Apartment - Morning
    FADE IN.
    Frasier is asleep in his bedroom, with a mask over his eyes.
    
    Ferguson, an English butler of about fifty, comes into the room with a 
    serving tray and opens the curtains, letting light in.  He then takes 
    a bottle of cologne and squirts a fine puff over Frasier's head.  
    As it settles on his face, Frasier wakes up._
    
     **Frasier:** Ah, Ferguson.  Is it morning already?
    **Ferguson:** Indeed, sir.  I trust you slept well?
     **Frasier:** Best sleep I've had in years.
    **Ferguson:** Excellent.  Your coffee, sir.
     **Frasier:**[_takes it_] Thank you.  To think I was skeptical when you said 
              these pillows could be better arranged.
    **Ferguson:** Yes, preparing a suitable sleeping environment is one of the 
              first tasks I learned at my father's knee.
     **Frasier:** Oh, your father also "butled?"
    **Ferguson:** Oh yes, sir.  Even my father's father was a gentleman's 
              gentleman.
     **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Oh, that's a good one, Ferguson.
    **Ferguson:** Thank you, sir, it's one of my staples.  Will it be breakfast 
              _en suite_ today, sir?
     **Frasier:** No, I believe I'll join the rest of the household.
    **Ferguson:** Very good, sir.
    
    _He helps Frasier into his bathrobe._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Ferguson.  Ah, you spoil me.  Keep it up.
    
    _CUT TO: 
    
    Frasier's Living Room:
    Daphne and Martin are eating breakfast in their bathrobes.  The table 
    is now covered by a fine lace cloth and set with elegant silverware.  
    Frasier comes out._
    
    **Frasier:** Morning, Dad, Daphne.
    **Martin/Daphne:** Fras./Morning.
     **Martin:** Where's Lord Weirdo?
    **Frasier:** Dad, his name is Ferguson.
    _As Ferguson comes out, the phone rings.  Frasier lets Ferguson answer._
    **Ferguson:** Good morning, Dr. Crane's residence.  Oh, good morning, 
              Dr. Crane.  Oh, thank you, sir, your phone manner is 
              also delightful. [_gives it to Daphne_] It's Dr. Crane 
              for you, miss.
      **Daphne:** Oh, thank you. [_gets up; into phone_] Hello, Niles.  Oh, yes!
    
    _She goes to the kitchen.  Frasier opens the newspaper._
    
     **Frasier:** Dear God!
      **Martin:** What's wrong?
     **Frasier:** That politicking Alan Murchie has just been elected president 
              of the opera board!
      **Martin:** Yeah, I'll never forget where I was when I heard the news.
     **Frasier:** This pinhead is president, I can't even get on the board!
    **Ferguson:** And what will you be sending to congratulate Mr. Murchie, 
              sir?
     **Frasier:** Curses and epithets is all he'll get from me!
    **Ferguson:** Quite right.  However, a well-chosen gift might draw the eye 
              of Mr. Murchie as he considers a replacement for his now-
              vacant seat on the board.
    
    _Martin gives Frasier a "not bad" look._
    
     **Frasier:** Well, if it'll make you happy, Ferguson, let's send him a 
              bottle of Chateau Belle Veux.
    **Ferguson:** If I may, sir, I'm overheard Mr. Murchie speak fondly of the 
              family villa in Umbria.  He may consider a wine from that 
              region especially thoughtful.
    
    _Martin gives Frasier another look._
    
    **Frasier:** It's a little on the nose, but fine.
    
    _Reset to Kitchen:
    Ferguson comes in to put breakfast away just as Daphne is finishing._
      **Daphne:** I love you, too.  Bye. [_hangs up_]
    **Ferguson:** Manchester, right?
      **Daphne:** Is it that obvious?
    **Ferguson:** To me it is.  My mum's from Manchester.  Used to scream her 
              lungs out for United.
      **Daphne:** Is that so?  My Uncle Jack once tried to get Bobby Charlton's 
              autograph, until Bobby cracked him over the head with a can 
              of lager.  Twelve stitches, and he still has the can!  Here, 
              let me give you a hand tidying up.
    **Ferguson:** Oh, thank you, miss.
      **Daphne:** You know, you needn't stand on ceremony for Dr. Crane's 
              father.  He prefers it if you're more informal.
    **Ferguson:** Oh, it's rather difficult for me.  I'm accustomed to 
              formality. 
    _Ferguson takes a fruit basket on the stove and begins polishing the 
    apples._
    **Ferguson:** Besides, I find it's more professional.  It helps draw the 
              line between a family and its servant.
      **Daphne:** Are you referring to Niles and me?
    **Ferguson:** Oh, that's none of my business.
      **Daphne:** No, it's all right.  We're together.  He told me he'd been in 
              love with me for seven years, and [_giggles_] I couldn't help 
              but fall head over heels.  It's like a fairy tale.
    **Ferguson:** Seven years?  He sounds shy.
      **Daphne:** Oh, he is.  He was also married for much of the time.
    **Ferguson:** Mm... but now your prince is free.
      **Daphne:** Almost.  He married someone else.
    **Ferguson:** I see.
      **Daphne:** No, you don't understand.  Once that divorce goes through, 
              we'll be together forever.
    **Ferguson:** Well, I hope it's moving swiftly through the course.
      **Daphne:** Oh, he hasn't filed yet.  
    _The ridiculousness of what she's saying is gradually becoming as clear 
    to her as it is to him._
    
      **Daphne:** But when his wife thinks the time is right, which is soon, 
              he will.  Well, not that she's in charge of us... [_flustered_] 
              Oh look, I'm giving you the wrong impression-
    **Ferguson:** Miss Moon, please understand that this is not meant to be 
              cruel.  But I've witnessed much heartbreak in my career, 
              and I've come to know that an employee-employer romance 
              has little chance of success.  The status relationship will 
              always exist.
      **Daphne:** Oh, thank goodness I'm not as cynical as you are!  True love 
              is stronger than status.  I don't care what anyone says or 
              thinks, Niles and I are in love. [_turns to go, then_] And 
              don't spread that around, it's a secret.
    
    _Ferguson smiles.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Apartment
    FADE IN.
    Martin is watching TV in his Armchair, hoisting a beer in one hand and 
    a sandwich in the other.  Ferguson stands beside him with the remote.  
    There are the sounds of horses whinnying._
    
     **Martin:** Next.
    
    _Ferguson changes the channel.  Dramatic music._
    
     **Martin:** Next.
    
    _Ferguson changes again.  Sci-Fi laser blasts._
    
     **Martin:** Next.
    
    _Ferguson changes._
    
     **Martin:** Ooh, Shark Week!  At ease.
    
    _Ferguson puts down the remote.  Frasier comes in the front door._
    
     **Frasier:** Good day, all!
      **Martin:** Hey, Fras!  How'd your lunch go with that opera guy?
     **Frasier:** Excellent!  Not only did Murchie rave on and on about the 
              bottle of Umbrian wine I sent, but he intimated that I was 
              "Opera Board timber!" [_chuckles_] Now all I have to do is 
              continue on my charm-offensive with the other board members.
    **Ferguson:** Then might I suggest a party, sir?
     **Frasier:** Oh, I'm way ahead of you this time.  I was thinking of a 
              little post-opera soiree next week after the opening of 
              _Turandot._
    **Ferguson:** If I may take the liberty, sir, perhaps holding the party 
              prior to the opera might be easier on the older guests.
     **Frasier:** That's good thinking.  Yes, yes, it's a very nice spin on 
              my initial, uh... insight of the party.
    **Ferguson:** You flatter me, sir.
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Ferguson opens the door to Niles._
    
     **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
       **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.  Ah yes, Ferguson!
    **Ferguson:** How do you do, sir?
       **Niles:** Very well.
    **Ferguson:** May I take your coat, sir?
       **Niles:** Certainly.
    _As Ferguson takes his coat, Niles and Frasier share a look, like boys 
    over a thrilling toy._
    
    **Ferguson:** Sherry, Dr. Crane?
       **Niles:** Oh, thank you, Ferguson, but even as we speak I have a bottle 
              of Veuve Clicquot chilling in my apartment, and you know the 
              old caution: "champagne after sherry makes tummy grow wary."
    **Ferguson:** You have your brother's wit, sir.
    
    _Ferguson goes to hang up Niles's coat.  Niles sits on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** So Niles, you're awfully chipper today.
      **Niles:** And why not?  Daphne and I are going out on a date!
    
    _Martin and Frasier exchange worried glances._
    
    **Frasier:** Wha-?  Niles, what if somebody sees you and reports back to 
             Mel?
      **Niles:** Mel be damned!  Daphne and I are going to have a romantic 
             evening together at _my_ apartment - not only that, she's going 
             in _my_ car, in _my_ backseat, under a pile of _my_ coats and 
             blankets!
    
    _From his coat, Niles's cell phone rings._
    
       **Niles:** Oh, cell phone.
    **Ferguson:** Shall I?
       **Niles:** Can he?
     **Frasier:** Uh, would you?
    **Ferguson:**[_answering_] Dr. Crane's line.
    _Niles mouths, "I love that!" to Frasier.  Daphne comes out in an 
    evening dress._
    
     **Daphne:** I'm ready.
      **Niles:** Oh Daphne, you look ravishing.
     **Daphne:**[_giggles_] Oh, thank you.
    
    _As they kiss, Ferguson holds out the phone._
    
    **Ferguson:** It's Mrs. Crane, sir.
    
    _Her name lands between Niles and Daphne like a brick wall._
    
      **Niles:**[_taking the phone_] Hello, Mel.  What?  Wait a minute, 
             I thought we agreed twenty-four hours' notice, you 
             can't just... all right, fine.  I'll see you then. 
    
    _He hangs up._
    
    **Frasier:** Everything all right, Niles?
      **Niles:** It's Mel, she's having tea with her sorority sisters and would 
             like me to show up - late, of course, and preferably boorish.
     **Martin:** Oh, for Pete's sake, I thought this was supposed to be over 
             by now.
      **Niles:** Yes well, so did I, but as Mel so politely reminded me, if I 
             want this divorce to be quick and simple, I have to dance to 
             her tune.
    
    _Daphne sits at the table.  Niles kneels in front of her._
    
      **Niles:** I'm sorry.  You understand, don't you?
     **Daphne:** I guess so.
      **Niles:** That's my girl. [_kisses her cheek_] I will make this up to you, 
             I promise.
     **Daphne:** You better get going.
    
    _Niles leaves.  Daphne goes into the kitchen, where Ferguson is._
    
     **Daphne:** You heard, didn't you?
    
    _Ferguson offers her his handkerchief._
    
      **Daphne:** No, I don't need that!  I mean, I know he loves me... 
              and it took him seven years to tell me.  His ex-wife 
              walked all over him, and now Mel's doing the same thing!  
              What, is it going to take another seven years before he 
              stands up for himself, or for us?
    **Ferguson:** Why do you suppose he hasn't?
      **Daphne:** I don't know.  For the first time I'm beginning to wonder 
              if... if maybe there are too many differences.  Maybe he 
              feels he has too much to lose.  Oh God, Ferguson, maybe 
              you were right.
    
    _She breaks down sobbing.  Ferguson, with his usual prescience, 
    spreads his handkerchief on his lapel just as she bows over and 
    cries on his shoulder.  He puts his arm around her.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **WHAT THE BUTLER SAW**
    
    _Scene Four - Apartment
    FADE IN.
    The Apartment is now decorated for Frasier's party.  A tasteful easy 
    chair stands in place of Martin's Armchair.
    
    As Ferguson pops champagne, Frasier comes out in his tuxedo._
    
    **Ferguson:** I hope everything meets with your approval, sir.
     **Frasier:** Oh yes, indeed, indeed. [_notices_] Where's Dad's chair?
    **Ferguson:** I took the liberty of removing it for the party.
     **Frasier:** But Dad'll be furious!  And I completely forgot: he'll 
              be here!  Swigging from a can and guessing women's weight, 
              I'll be blackballed!
    
    _Martin comes out in his letterman jacket._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, uh, listen, about tonight-
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, I'd love to hobnob and whatnot, but the Towncar's 
             waiting to take me to the game.  Thanks for the tickets, Fras. 
             [_clears throat_] Fergie?
    _Martin holds out his arms.  Ferguson places a paper bag in one hand, 
    and a giant foam "We're #1!" hand (with extended index finger) in the 
    other._
    
    **Ferguson:** Your meatloaf sandwich, sir, and your finger.
    
    _Martin goes out the door, and Ferguson closes it behind him._
    
    **Ferguson:** I hope you don't mind, sir.
     **Frasier:**[_still surprised_] Not at all.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Ferguson, positions.
    
    _Ferguson opens the door to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, what are you doing here?
      **Niles:** Oh Frasier, don't panic, I'm not crashing your party.   
             I'm here to pick up Daphne.  We're going to the mall.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, no chance of running into Mel there.
      **Niles:** It should be a night to remember.  We're going someplace 
             called "the Limited."  
    
    _Daphne comes out in her bathrobe._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne!  Why aren't you dressed?
     **Daphne:** I'm not sure if I'm up to going out tonight.  I really hate 
             all this sneaking around.
      **Niles:** It's not sneaking around!  We're going to be out in public, 
             at the Tacoma Mall!  But the most important thing is, we'll 
             be together.
    
    _He kisses her._
    
     **Daphne:** All right, I suppose that really is what matters.
    
    _She leads him to her room._
    
      **Niles:** All right, now tell me again, what are we going to eat?
     **Daphne:** Curly fries!
      **Niles:** Ooh...
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Ferguson opens the door to Roz._
    
    **Ferguson:** Good evening, and welcome to the home of Dr. Frasier-
     **Frasier:** Oh save it, it's just Roz. [_Roz is not flattered_] 
              What are you doing here?
         **Roz:**[_holds up boxes_] Um, your gift-wrapping came in.
     **Frasier:** I thought I just ordered a few rolls!
         **Roz:** You were more generous than you thought.
    **Ferguson:** I'll put it in your room, sir.
         **Roz:** You look like a gift-giver-
     **Frasier:** Roz, you put it in my room, he's working!
    _As he hustles her away, the doorbell rings a third time.  Ferguson 
    opens the door to Alan Murchie, his wife Diane, and Mr. Worth, a man 
    in his sixties._
    
     **Frasier:** Alan Murchie, lovely to see you!
     **Murchie:**[_shaking hands_] Likewise.  I don't think you've met my wife, 
              Diane.
     **Frasier:**_Enchant e._
     **Murchie:** And this is Henry Worth, another board member.
     **Frasier:** Ah, Henry, lovely to meet you.
    **Ferguson:** May I take your coats?
     **Murchie:** Oh, thank you.
    _As they enter, Ferguson takes their coats and goes to hang them up._
    
      **Diane:** Frasier, isn't that the colonel's old butler?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Ferguson.  My sense of duty compelled me to take him in 
             after the colonel passed.
    **Murchie:**[_amused_] Yes, we felt the same sense of duty toward his art 
             collection.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs nervously_] Oh, that's very droll... 
    
    _He turns and sees Roz standing with Mr. Worth at the bar._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me.
    
    _He rushes over._
    
        **Roz:**...collection.  And the family pack really is your best value-
    **Frasier:**[_grabs her_] Roz, what are you doing out here?  I'm sure 
             Mr. Worth isn't interested in gift-wrapping.
      **Worth:** Nonsense, she's delightful.  Now, what kind of deal would you 
             give me if I bought a hundred rolls?
        **Roz:** Oh, I'd take off twenty percent.
      **Worth:** And what would you take off if I bought five thousand rolls?
        **Roz:**[_unfazed_] Everything but my bracelets.
      **Worth:**[_laughing_] Yes, sir!
    _Frasier, shocked, turns away to see Ferguson open the door to a 
    second couple, Ted & Lois._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, Ted and Lois!  Oh please, come in.
       **Lois:** I hope you don't mind, but we had an extra ticket, so we 
             brought a friend.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course, the more the merrier!
    
    _As Ted and Lois come in, they part to reveal - Mel!_
    
        **Mel:** Good evening, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Mel... what a delightful surprise.  I had no idea you knew the 
             Fischers.
    
    _Niles and Daphne come out of the hallway, laughing._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, uh, look who's here!
      **Niles:**[_stops dead_] Darling!
        **Mel:** Niles, I didn't think I'd see you here tonight, I thought you 
             were working late... [_sweet_] Oh well, lucky me!
      **Niles:** No, [_kisses her_] lucky me!
    **Frasier:**[_before Daphne can scream_] Lucky all of us!  Please, won't you 
             sit down?
    
    _As the guests sit, Niles pulls Mel close and drops his voice._
    
      **Niles:** What, uh - what are you doing here?
        **Mel:** Look, I didn't know we were stopping by here on our way, 
             so just put on your party face and deal with it.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm sorry, I have plans.
        **Mel:** Yes, you do - to be by your wife's side.
    
    _Frasier, sensing trouble, rushes to calm them._
    
    **Frasier:** Everybody good?  Everybody happy?  Let's try to respect 
             the feelings and long-held dreams of others.
        **Mel:** Don't worry, Frasier, everything's going to be fine.
    
    _She moves off._
    
    **Frasier:** "Fine?"  Fine for whom?  Is that code, what does that mean?!
    
    _Niles rushes to Daphne._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne, Daphne, I'm so sorry.  Listen, this party can't last 
             more than an hour, after that we'll have the whole evening 
             together, I promise.
     **Daphne:** Please don't make any more promises you can't keep. 
        **Mel:** Oh, Niles!  Come over here and listen to Tedd's funny joke 
             about communists in heaven!
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm laughing already!
    
    _He goes over to Mel.  
    
    DISSOLVE TO: Later.
    
    Near the kitchen, Murchie is standing with Frasier._
    
    **Murchie:** Frasier, this party is a triumph!  I shouldn't be telling 
             you this, but if my straw poll is any indication, we may 
             be seeing you at the next board meeting.
    **Frasier:** Oh well, I-I hope you don't think that's why I did this!  
             But it's certainly a nice fringe benefit.
    **Murchie:**[_amused_] I'm no farmer, Crane, but I can smell manure a mile 
             away.  You'll be a welcome addition.
    
    _Frasier laughs, then catches Ferguson passing by._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Ferguson, Ferguson, listen, make sure that everyone 
             has champagne.  I have a little toast in mind that I 
             daresay will seal the deal.
    _Nearby, Todd and Lois are chatting with Niles and Mel.  Daphne, 
    whom Frasier has conscripted to serve hors d'oeuvres, is forced
    to stand right in front of them and play the mute serving girl._
        **Ted:** By the by, don't make any plans for New Year's Eve.  Lo and I 
             are having a blowout at our Mercer Island Place.
      **Niles:** Well, that's a very generous offer, but, uh-
        **Mel:** Oh, we'd love to.  It'll give you a chance to wear that 
             new Valentino I might be getting you-
    _Daphne, unable to take any more, puts down the tray and runs to her
    room, passing Ferguson._
    
    **Ferguson:** Miss Moon?
    
    _Niles sees her go._
    
      **Niles:** Uh, Mel, may I see you for a moment?
        **Mel:** Uh, well actually I-
      **Niles:** Yeah, thank you, thank you, excuse us, excuse us, just 
             one second.
    _He drags her into the kitchen, where Ferguson is refilling the glasses.  
    Ferguson sees them and makes a hasty exit._
    
      **Niles:** New Year's Eve with you?  Are you out of your mind?
        **Mel:** Keep your voice down!
      **Niles:** Look, I have gone along with this charade because I hurt you, 
             but now you're just dragging it out to be vindictive.  I'm not 
             going to tolerate it any longer.
        **Mel:** Oh, really?  And what are you going to do about it?
      **Niles:** Keep pushing me, you'll find out.
        **Mel:** Don't threaten me.  You made a promise, and you're going to 
             keep it!
    _In the living room, Ferguson brings an armful of coats and wraps to the 
    guests._
    
    **Ferguson:**[_handing Diane her wrap_] Your wrap, madam, Dr. Crane thanks 
              you for coming...
    _Frasier grabs him and pulls him aside._
     **Frasier:** Ferguson, Ferguson, what in blue blazes are you doing?
    **Ferguson:** Perhaps to spare you some embarrassment, sir, I took the 
              liberty.
     **Frasier:** Stop!  You're taking far too much liberty with the liberty-
              taking!  Please, just see that everyone has some champagne.
    **Ferguson:**[_obeying_] Sir.
    _He replaces the coats, and Frasier calls for attention and raises his
    glass._
    **Frasier:** There's no need to leave.  Uh, I would like to propose a toast...
    
    _From the kitchen, the voices of the happy couple burst out loud and clear._
    
      **Niles:** No Mel, why don't you listen for once?  I'm through!
        **Mel:**_I'll_ tell you when you're through, you spineless twit, 
             AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!
    _Frasier runs to the light switch and frantically flicks it on and off, 
    like the house lights at an intermission._
    
    **Frasier:** Opera time, opera time!  On to the show!
    _To no avail.  Everyone's attention is on the kitchen -- including Daphne, 
    who has entered from her room just in time to see Mel storm out of the 
    kitchen, followed by Niles._
    
      **Niles:** That's it, Mel, I'm sick of these games!
        **Mel:** Niles, don't make a scene.
      **Niles:** I don't care!  I love Daphne, and I'm not putting her through 
             this torture another second!  This sham of a marriage is OVER!
    _Angle on Daphne: "And the trumpets sounded for her on the other side..."
    
    For a moment, there is a standoff.  Then everyone from the board rushes 
    to comfort Mel._
    
      **Diane:** It's all right, dear, we've known for some time he doesn't 
             deserve you.
        **Mel:** Well, you've seen what I have to put up with.  I've tried so 
             hard, I really have.
       **Lois:** I don't know how you've put up with him this long.
        **Mel:** I just want out.
        **Ted:** Don't worry, I'll handle the divorce papers personally!  This 
             jackass will be out of your life by the end of the week!
      **Niles:** You mean it?
    _Everyone leaves.  Before he goes, Alan gives Frasier an amused look 
    that spells doom to his prospects for a board seat._
    
    **Murchie:** See you around, Crane.
    _Murchie and Diane leave.  Niles hasn't heard Daphne come up behind him._
     **Daphne:** I love you, too.
    
    _They hug.  Frasier is still crestfallen._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, come on, Frasier, you don't want to spend the evening 
             with those snobs anyway.
    
    _Worth sticks his head back through the door._
    
      **Worth:** Coming, Roz?
        **Roz:** Yeah, I'll be right there.
    
    _She gets up and goes to the door._
    
        **Roz:**[_off everyone's looks_] I'm just getting an early start on the 
             candy drive.
    
    _She leaves._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, I'm-I'm sorry I ruined your evening.
    **Frasier:** It's all right, Niles.  It's a small price to pay to finally 
             see you and Daphne together.
      **Niles:** It's true - we're free! [_Daphne laughs_] No more hiding!  
             Where do you want to go?  Dinner?  Dancing?  London?  Paris?
     **Daphne:** Why don't we go for a walk?
      **Niles:** Even better.
    
    _Ferguson appears with their coats._
    
    **Ferguson:** If you'll allow me.
       **Niles:** Thank you, Ferguson.
    **Ferguson:** My pleasure, sir.
      **Daphne:**[_with all her heart_] Thank you, Ferguson.
    **Ferguson:** It was my privilege, Miss Moon.
    
    _They leave._
    
     **Frasier:** All right, Ferguson, we got some fences to mend with 
              the board.  What do we send and to whom do we send it?
    **Ferguson:** Actually, sir, I regret to inform you that I must tender my 
              resignation.
     **Frasier:** Please, don't be upset that things didn't go so well this 
              evening.  I'll make it up to you - send yourself something!
    **Ferguson:** Thank you, sir, but it's not you.  It was your brother and 
              Miss Moon.  His willingness to break social rank has inspired 
              me.  And there's a certain Lady Westerfield whose acquaintance 
              I'd like to renew.
     **Frasier:** Ah.  True love and all that.  Well, [_extends his hand_] 
              good luck, Ferguson.
    **Ferguson:**[_shakes it_] Thank you, sir.
     **Frasier:** Now, if you'll excuse me, I've had rather a difficult evening.  
              Think I'll just go take a sad soak in the tub.
    **Ferguson:** Sir, after such an evening, it's not right for a man to 
              draw his own bath.  So, if I may take the liberty...
     **Frasier:** Carry on, Ferguson.
    _Ferguson bows and goes to the bathroom.  Frasier lets out a wistful 
    sigh._
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier's Room:
    Frasier is sleeping as before.  Suddenly Eddie comes in, yanks open 
    the curtains with his teeth, and jumps on Frasier's stomach.  Frasier 
    awakens violently.
    
    Martin comes in and chases Eddie around the room, finally herding him 
    out.  Frasier collapses back down and pulls the covers over his head.
