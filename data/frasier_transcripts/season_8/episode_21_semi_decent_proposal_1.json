Frasier says \"Nimm ihn einfach ncht zur Kenntnis\" which means \"Just ignore him\". Claire's response sounds like gibberish to me except for the \"Ja Ja\" (\"Yes yes\"). The way she pronounces \"Ja Ja\" and the way her face looks while saying it, she's actually saying something along the line of \"whatever you say, I don't take you seriously, I ignore what you're saying and my answer is condescending just to shut you up\".  Also Frasier doesn't seem to know that in Germany at this point of a relation and in this situation he wouldn't say \"Nimm ihn einfach nicht zur Kenntnis\" but \"Nehmen Sie ihn einfach nicht zur Kenntnis\". The difference is the social situation. The formal you (Sie) maintains some kind of distance between persons so it's usually used when adults are talking business for example in a shop or in the workplace. Adults who are familiar with one another and have agreed on using the familiar you (du or Du at the beginning of the sentence) would say \"Nimm ihn einfach nicht zur Kenntnis\". The same applies for adults talking to children and adolescents under the age of 18. Parents and their children usually talk to one another using the familiar you. Children and adolescents also use the familiar you when they're among themselves. In public schools for example children and adolescents address adults using the formal you unless the adults allow a familiar you. So they would say \"Nehmen Sie ihn einfach nicht zur Kenntnis.\"_]  ",
