    _Act 3
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Niles and Daphne are sitting on the couch, Frasier is on
    the arm of Martin's chair talking to them._
    
     **Daphne:** Explain to me again how you and Mel masquerading as husband
             and wife is a good thing?
      **Niles:** Well...
    **Frasier:** If I may?  Uh, Daphne, it's basically to give Mel a little
             wiggle room so she can get out of this debacle with her
             dignity intact.
    
    _Daphne reaches over and takes Niles' hand._
    
     **Daphne:** And what about Niles' dignity?
    **Frasier:** Well, Maris got that in the divorce. [_laughing_] Sorry, Niles. 
             [_rising_] Would you like some sherry?
      **Niles:** Uh, yes, thanks.
    **Frasier:** Daphne?
     **Daphne:**[_rising_] Yeah, all right, I'll get your precious wedge of brie 
             and your water crackers.
    **Frasier:** No, I meant would you like some sherry?
     **Daphne:**[_stunned_] Oh, love some, thanks.  [_She sits back down._]
      **Niles:** Listen, Daphne, I know this is all very awkward, but if it
             speeds up the divorce process and avoids the misery I went
             through with Maris, isn't it worth it?
     **Daphne:** Well, I...
      **Niles:** Oh, come on, Schnookums, we can get through this together.
             What do you say?
     **Daphne:** What did you just call me?
      **Niles:** Schnookums.
     **Daphne:** Schnookums...
      **Niles:** It was an attempt at a pet name.
     **Daphne:** Well, if it's all the same to you, can we keep looking?
      **Niles:** Absolutely, there's no rush whatsoever... Truffles. [_an 
             awkward pause_] It's the chocolate, not the fungus. [_another
             pause_] It's a work in progress.
     **Daphne:** Yes.
    
    _Frasier returns with the sherry._
    
    **Frasier:** Here we are.
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** For you... here it is: To better days.  For all of us.
     **Daphne:** Why, what happened to you?
    **Frasier:** Well, I went down to talk to Donny, try to convince him to
             drop his lawsuit against you.  Instead, he's now suing me 
             as well for the part I played in getting you two together.
     **Daphne:** Well, I am so sorry, Dr. Crane.  This is turning into such
             a horrible mess!  Not that I expected it to be a bed of
             roses, mind you, but it's gotten so you're wonder what
             God-awful calamity's going to befall us all next.
    
    _Simon comes in the front door._
    
      **Simon:** Something smells in your elevator.   Oh, now it smells in here,
             too.  I'm beginning to think this is not such a ritzy building
             after all.
    
    _He heads for the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** Did you get my wedding gifts down to the post?
      **Simon:** As we speak, they are winging their way towards their rightful
             owners.
     **Daphne:** Thank you, Simon.
    
    _He returns with a beer and sits in Martin's chair._
    
      **Simon:** And in a totally unrelated matter, I am pleased to announce
             that the Winnebago is now fully equipped with a state of the
             art DVD, complete with surround sound.
     **Daphne:** I don't believe this!
      **Simon:** Tonight's feature is "Braveheart", starring Australia's
             favorite son, Mr. Mel Gibson.  Showtime is at eight sharp,
             everyone is invited.
     **Daphne:** As tempting as that sounds, I have a date.  Niles is taking
             me to dinner and dancing.  At least this day will end on a
             high note.
      **Niles:** I guess I can't avoid telling you this any longer...
    
    _Martin comes from his room._
    
     **Martin:** I just want you to know, I'm attending this wedding reception
             under protest.
     **Daphne:** Wedding reception?
      **Niles:** Thanks, Dad.  Yeah, well, you know those social obligations
             I was talking about?  One of them is tonight.
     **Daphne:** A wedding reception?  For you and Mel?
      **Niles:** It's at the equestrian center.  It's nothing major, it's very
             impromptu.  Champagne, cake, we pet the horses, we're out of
             there by eleven!
     **Daphne:** But what about our...
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh, Niles, look at the time.  I'm sorry Daphne, but
             we've got to get cross town in an hour.  You better get home
             and get changed.
    
    _Niles and Daphne stand up._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, don't forget to wear that watch Mel gave you.
    
    _He and Frasier exit to the bedrooms._
    
     **Daphne:** Watch?
      **Niles:** Thanks again, Dad!  I can explain that.  I, I can explain
             everything.  Tomorrow.  It's just a twenty-four hour delay.
             [_He heads for the door._] I switched all the reservations.
             Dining, dancing, everything.  I promise I will make it up to
             you... pookie. [_pause_] Even I hate that one.
    
    _He leaves._
    
     **Daphne:** But what about our date?
    _She sits on the couch and begins to cry.  Simon goes over to comfort 
    her._
      **Simon:** Now, now, now, Daphne.  Don't cry, don't cry.  It's all right.
             This sounds like a job for Braveheart.
    
    _Which just makes her cry harder.  FADE OUT._
    
    **MUCKING ABOUT WITH
    THE HORSEY SET**
    
    _Scene 2 - The Equestrian Center
    Fade in.  Frasier and Martin are standing at the bar in the club area._
     **Martin:** Don't look now, but there's a guy over there in a bow tie
             who's been checking me out for the last twenty minutes.
    **Frasier:** Oh, one of Mel's colleagues.  I met him earlier.
     **Martin:** What's he keep staring at me for?
    **Frasier:** Well, he's a plastic surgeon.  Maybe he's looking at your
             eyelids and planning his next trip to Maui.
    
    _Niles, over with Mel, lets out a very loud, forced laugh._
    
    **Frasier:** Good lord!  Look at him, over-acting.  Trying to convince
             everyone he's happily married.  Have you ever seen anything
             so pathetic in your life?
     **Martin:** How 'bout you and Lilith?
    **Frasier:** It was a rhetorical question!
    
    _CUT TO: Mel and Niles meeting with people._
    
      **Niles:** Thank you.
        **Mel:** Niles, I'd, I'd like you to meet Adrianna Pettibone.
      **Niles:** Hello.
        **Mel:** Adrianna stables General Prescott, our current grand champion
             right here at the Equestrian Club.
      **Niles:** Wonderful!  Speaking of grand champions, how about this little
             filly, hmm?  I didn't even have to check her teeth!
    
    _Adrianna walks away with an odd look.  Mel stares at Niles._
    
        **Mel:** What are you doing?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.
    
    _Roz walks up, limping._
    
        **Roz:** Well, I'm here.  Congratulations and all that BS, where's the
             bar?
      **Niles:** Roz, what are you doing here?
        **Mel:** I invited her.  Your side of the guest list looked a little
             sparse.
        **Roz:** Well, forgive me if I'm not in the spirit of this - wink, wink -- 
             "happy occasion," but I'm in a very crappy mood.
      **Niles:** Are you limping?
        **Roz:** Yeah.  I twisted my ankle on the stairs.  You know how that
             happened?  I couldn't find the shoes that went with this dress,
             so I had to wear these stupid three inch spikes.  And the
             "check engine" light on my dash keeps coming on.
      **Niles:** What does that have to do with your ankle?
        **Roz:** Nothing, it just really ticks me off!  The bar, the bar! 
             [_Niles and Mel both point._] Thank you!
    
    _She limps off._
    
      **Niles:** That was so sweet of her to come.
        **Mel:** Niles, this is important.  If anyone should ask about the
             honeymoon, we're flying to Paris, then we're taking the Orient
             Express to Venice, where we'll spend two weeks at the Monsarta
             Palazzetto suite at the Cipriani.
    
    _Niles stares at her for a moment._
    
        **Mel:** What's the matter?
      **Niles:** Sounds like a wonderful trip.
        **Mel:** It's not my fault we're not going.
      **Niles:** I know.
    
    _A photographer comes over._
    
    **Photographer:** Ah, here's the happy couple.  All right, you two, show me 
                  those pearly whites.
    
    _They pose for a shot._
    
    **Photographer:** All right, now how 'bout a kiss?
           **Niles:** All right, I hardly know you, but...
    
    _He takes a step towards the photographer with a laugh, Mel puts her
    hand on his arm._
    
      **Niles:** Here we go.
    
    _He kisses Mel on the cheek._
    
    **Photographer:** Come on, Doc, this is your wife, not mine.
           **Niles:** All right, well...
    
    _He puts his arms around her and they kiss.  Everyone makes an "Aww"
    sound and claps._
    
        **Mel:** Thank you.
      **Niles:** Yes, I'll, uh, I'll go check on Dad and Frasier.
    
    _CUT TO: the bar, where Frasier is talking to a couple._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, they do make a lovely couple.
      **Woman:** Don't they?  I'm sure they'll be happy together for many 
             years.
     **Martin:** Well, you never know.
    **Frasier:** Dad?
     **Martin:** Well, you don't, do you?  I mean, I'm just saying you never
             know.
      **Woman:** No, I... guess you don't.
    **Frasier:** Lovely talking with you.  Enjoy the party.
    
    _The couple walks away._
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell's wrong with you?
     **Martin:** In a few weeks, I'm gonna look like a genius.
    
    _Roz comes over to them._
    
        **Roz:** Well, I really feel stupid.  I just came on to the guy in the
             tux.  They really should make waiters wear name tags.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, Roz.  Carrying trays and taking drink orders leaves
             so much room for ambiguity.
        **Roz:** Shut up!
    
    _Niles comes up._
    
      **Niles:** Well, well, I think it's going pretty well.  Don't you?  
             You think anyone's suspicious?
     **Martin:** No, no.  It's the greatest phony reception I've ever been to.
             So, how you holdin' up, son?
      **Niles:** Oh, well, if I have to stretch my muscles into a smile one
             more time, I think my face may crack...
        **Mel:** Niles?
      **Niles:**[_smiling big_] Yes, Darling!
        **Mel:** It's time to cut the cake, so why don't you just gather
             everyone around?
      **Niles:** OK.
        **Mel:** All right. [_He moves off, she turns to Martin._] Um, excuse me, 
             I need to borrow Frasier for just one moment.
     **Martin:** Sure.
    
    _Martin and Roz move off._
    
        **Mel:** Uh, Frasier, I had an interesting little phone call from
             Donny this afternoon.
    **Frasier:** Oh?
        **Mel:** Yes, he said you'd been by to see him earlier today.
    **Frasier:** I may have done so.
        **Mel:** Yes, he said you were a busy little bee before the wedding.
             First buzzing in Niles' ear, and then you were buzzing in
             Daphne's ear...
    **Frasier:** Let me explain Mel.  You see...
        **Mel:** Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz...
    **Frasier:** Just stop that, please!
        **Mel:** You see, I've been torturing myself trying to figure out how
             this all happened so quickly, and now I know.  I won't forget
             about this.
    
    _She walks away and Martin returns._
    
     **Martin:** What was that all about?
    **Frasier:** Donny talked to Mel.
     **Martin:** Told you not to go down there.
    **Frasier:** Oh, just stop that!
    
    _Mel clinks a spoon against a glass, calling for silence._
    
        **Mel:** Attention everyone!  Before we cut the cake, Niles' brother,
             Frasier, would like to make a toast in our honor.
     **Martin:** I didn't know you were doin' this.
    **Frasier:** Neither did I.
    
    _He gets a glass of champagne and composes himself._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, ah...  Love...is an awesome force.  It can make us do
             things we never imagined possible.  For you see, we don't
             actually choose love, it chooses us.  And once it has, we are
             powerless to do anything about it.  Ladies and gentlemen,
             raise your glasses with me in toasting my brother... and the
             love of his life.  
    
    _Mel understands what Frasier is doing, and hides her fury._
    
    **Frasier:** For she is truly the woman of his dreams, and my father and I 
             could not be more thrilled with his choice.  To the happy 
             couple!
    _Everyone makes "Hear, hear" comments and drinks.  Niles begins cutting
    the cake._
    
        **Mel:** Well, wasn't that clever of your brother?  It's only too bad
             your little English muffin couldn't be here to enjoy it as
             well.  Which reminds me: you do realize that while we are
             pretending to be married, you absolutely cannot be seen in
             public with Daphne?
      **Niles:** I, I...
    
    _She cuts him off by shoving the piece of cake in his mouth._
    
        **Mel:** I love you too, honey!
    
    _She turns and smiles for the photographer.  FADE OUT._
    
    _End of Act 3
    
    Act 4_
    **ACTUALLY A GOAT GOT
    MOST OF THE HOT DOG**
    _Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Simon comes through the front door._
    
      **Simon:** Hello?  Hello, is anybody home?
     **Martin:**[_from the kitchen_] Hey, Simon.  Just making coffee, you want
             some?
      **Simon:**[_lying down on the couch_] Ahh, I was thinking of something
             colder with a bit more of an amber hue.
     **Martin:** Beer?
      **Simon:** Brilliant! if you aren't the finest detective in Seattle,
             I am the Prince of Wales.
     **Martin:** How did Eddie like his walk?
    
    _Simon looks around nervously and gets up._
    
      **Simon:** The little nipper loved it.  I think nature's callin' him
             again.  His bladder's worse than mine.  I'll be back in a 
             flash.
    
    _He leaves.  Martin comes in and sits in his chair as Frasier enters
    from the bedrooms, putting his tie on._
    
    **Frasier:** Was that Simon's voice I heard just now?
     **Martin:** Yeah, he just took Eddie on a walk for me.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's about time that chowder made himself useful.
     **Martin:** Ah, don't be so hard on him.  He tries.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, if you're talking about my patience, he certainly
             does.
    
    _He opens the door to reveal Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, Niles, come on in.
      **Niles:** Frasier.  Oh, hey Dad, about a block from here, I saw a dog
             that looked remarkably like Eddie tied up outside a bar.
     **Martin:** Impossible, he was just here.
      **Niles:**[_sitting on the couch_] Oh.  So, uh, did you say anything to
             her?
    **Frasier:** No, no, you told us not to.
     **Martin:** You want us out of here when you drop the hammer?
      **Niles:** No, I think I'll be safer with witnesses.
    
    _Daphne comes from her room._
    
     **Daphne:** Niles.  I didn't hear you come in.
      **Niles:**[_rising_] I just got here.
     **Daphne:** Hey.
      **Niles:** Hey.
    
    _He goes to her.  They lean to kiss each other, but again are
    uncomfortable with the others watching, so they kiss on the 
    side of the mouth._
    
      **Niles:** How are you today?
    
    _They go to sit on the couch.  Frasier sits at the dining table._
     **Daphne:** Wonderful.  I realize that postponing our date one day
             doesn't really amount to much in the great scheme of things.
             So how was your wedding reception?
      **Niles:** Oh, it was your average night in hell.
     **Daphne:** Well, that's behind us, now.  We have a wonderful evening to
             look forward to.  I bought a new dress.  It's much too 
             expensive, but you're worth it.  And I'm getting me hair done 
             and me... [_to Frasier_] Why are you looking at each other like 
             that?
    **Frasier:** We're not looking at each other like that.  Like what?  What,
             like anything.
     **Martin:** Uh-uh.
     **Daphne:** Yes you were.  Those darting little glances mean something's
             up.  Niles?
      **Niles:** About tonight...
     **Daphne:** I hate the way this is starting.
      **Niles:** Mel feels that as long as she and I are acting to be married,
             you and I can't be seen together in public.  So that means...
     **Daphne:** I know what that means.
      **Niles:** But it's just until the divorce.
     **Daphne:** Whenever that bloody is.
      **Niles:** Daphne...
     **Daphne:** If you'll excuse me, I have a splitting headache.
    _She gets up and heads for her room, Niles following.  Frasier gets up
    and moves over to the couch to be out of the way._
    
      **Niles:** You know, if you look at it from Mel's point of view, it really
             does make a lot of sense.
    
    _Daphne stops and slowly turns around._
    
    **Frasier:** He came so close.
     **Daphne:** What did you say?
      **Niles:** I said "Damn that Mel!"
     **Daphne:** No you didn't.  You should have, but you didn't.  It sounded
             to me like you were taking her side.
      **Niles:** All right, all right.  Can we just turn the clock back two
             minutes and pretend this conversation never happened?
     **Daphne:** Why don't we just it back to ten minutes before my wedding
             and save everybody all this trouble?
    
    _She heads back to her room._
    
      **Niles:** What are you saying?
     **Daphne:**[_stopping again without turning_] What do you think I'm saying?
      **Niles:** It sounds like you're saying you're sorry you did this.
     **Daphne:**[_turning to him_] Maybe that's what I'm saying.
     **Martin:** Oh, boy.
    **Frasier:** Now listen, before anyone says something they'll regret...
     **Daphne:** Butt out!  If you hadn't opened your big mouth we wouldn't
             be in this mess!  Donny wouldn't be suing me and everyone
             else in sight and I wouldn't be out two weeks salary for a
             dress I'm apparently never going to wear, [_to Niles_] and you 
             wouldn't be kowtowing to that shrew of a wife of yours!
    **Frasier:** This is all _my_ fault?!
      **Niles:** Oh shut up, Frasier!  The only thing more hollow than your
             protest of innocence is your big fat head!
    **Frasier:** I AM WOUNDED!  I intervened only out of love for the two 
             people who are most important to...
     **Daphne:** Oh, put a sock in it! I am sick and tired of listening to you
             yammering on about everything under the sun!
      **Niles:** Daphne...
     **Daphne:** And I'm sick of listening to you, too.  You got anything to 
             say, old man?!
    _Martin, wide-eyed, says nothing and holds his hands up placatingly._
    
     **Daphne:** Good!
    
    _She storms off to her room._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm waiting!
      **Niles:** For what?
    **Frasier:** An apology.  For that unprovoked broadside you leveled at me.
      **Niles:** You expect me to apologize to you?
    **Frasier:** Expect it, sir, and demand it!
      **Niles:** Well, then, here's my answer: No!
    **Frasier:** No?!
      **Niles:**[_heading for the door_] No!  And furthermore, why don't you
             take your broadside, stuff it in a chair, and keep your
             unlimited supply of opinions, suggestions, proposals and
             recommendations to yourself?!
    **Frasier:** Well, I never!
      **Niles:** No, you always!
    **Frasier:** GET OUT!
    
    _Niles leaves, slamming the door._
    
     **Martin:**[_rising_] How's a corned beef sandwich sound?
    **Frasier:** I am appalled!
     **Martin:** Well, no problem, there's some smoked turkey in here, too.
    
    _He goes into the kitchen.  
    
    Reset to: the kitchen as he enters.  He goes to the refrigerator and 
    starts pulling things out.  Frasier comes in._
    
    **Frasier:** What is my offense?  What egregious sin have I committed,
             that I should be so maligned?  Was I to just sit idly by 
             and watch these two misguided souls embark on doomed
             relationships?  Would they have thanked me for that?  Not
             very likely, I dare say.
     **Martin:** Who moved the mustard?
    **Frasier:** Top shelf, door.
     **Martin:** Bingo.
    **Frasier:** And then, when they were perched on the very brink of 
             disaster, I snatched them from the gaping maw and placed  
             them gently into one another's arms.  But am I accorded a 
             hero's welcome for my troubles?  Am I hoisted on their 
             shoulders and paraded about the room?
    
    _Martin turns and hands him a jar._
    
     **Martin:** I don't have my glasses, what's the expiration date?
    **Frasier:** Last week.
     **Martin:** I'll chance it.
    **Frasier:** No!  Those two ingrates turn on me like vipers, and make me
             the villain of the piece.  Well, hear me now, this day
             forward, Frasier Crane will not interfere with those two!
             This is it!  Finished, finito!  _Non quam postea_!  
             [_N.B. Latin, "never again"_]
     **Martin:** Uh-huh.
    **Frasier:** I know I've made declarations like this before, but I tell
             you what, Dad, you mark the calendar!  You note the time on
             your watch! [_points to his own_] This - Is - It!
     **Martin:** Well, if you figure out a way to get them back together, 
             I'll be in my room if you need any help.
    
    _He leaves._
    
    **Frasier:** Have you been listening to me?
     **Martin:**[_from the living room_] Well, I tried not to, but some of it
             still got through.
    _Frasier starts putting everything away.  Daphne comes into the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Making yourself a sandwich?
    **Frasier:** No, Dad did.
     **Daphne:** Hope he didn't use the mayonnaise, I meant to throw it out.
    **Frasier:** I've seen him eat worse.
     **Daphne:** I'll say.  Remember when he dropped his hot dog at the
             petting zoo?
    
    _Frasier wipes down the counter._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry I said those things about you!
             I didn't mean them.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I know, Daphne.  Come here.
    
    _They hug._
    
     **Daphne:** I guess this all finally came crashing down on me.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know. It's perfectly understandable.  Listen, I know
             you can't go out on your date with Niles tonight, but what's
             to stop two friends from going out to dinner?  My treat, you
             can even wear that new dress of yours.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.  That's a lovely offer, but I, I think I'll just
             stay home tonight, have a quiet night.
    **Frasier:** I understand.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.
    
    _They exit.  
    
    Reset to: the living room as they come out._
    
    **Frasier:** Sure you won't change your mind?
     **Daphne:** Positive.
    
    _Simon comes in with Eddie._
    
      **Simon:** Hello, all.  My furry friend and I have just concluded our
             daily constitutional, with young Edward here dropping a few
             amendments along the way.  So what's on the docket tonight, 
             eh?
    _Frasier puts on his coat, gets his briefcase and goes to the door._
    
     **Daphne:** All I want is a quiet night at home.
      **Simon:**[_lying on the couch_] Oh, Stilts, you and I are of one mind.
             I'll hoist a beer while you get dinner started, and then when
             our bellies are full and you've done the dishes, we will
             adjourn to the Winnebago where Mr. Jean Claude van Damme, 
             the "Muscles from Brussels", will ply his trade against 
             the forces of evil.
    **Frasier:** Ready at eight?
     **Daphne:** Make it seven-thirty.
    _Frasier leaves.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment
    Fade in.  Martin and Niles are leaving the apartment to the hallway._
      **Niles:** Good idea, Dad.  An evening out, just the two of us.  I had no
             idea you enjoyed the Natural History Museum.
    
    _Martin hits the button for the elevator._
     **Martin:** Oh, sure.  And that documentary on the rain forest is supposed
             to be great.
      **Niles:** That's what I hear.
     **Martin:** Hope it has pygmies, I like pygmies.
      **Niles:** I know you do.  So, where's um...
     **Martin:** Oh, she went out with Frasier to a restaurant for dinner.
      **Niles:** Oh.  She happen to ask about...?
     **Martin:** Sorry.
    
    _The elevator arrives and they get in.  
    
    Reset to: the interior of the elevator.  
    Martin pushes a button and they start moving._
      **Niles:** Dad, we're going up.
     **Martin:** Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  Well, we'll just have to take the long
             way.
    _They ride up for a beat.  Niles begins to get suspicious._
      **Niles:** Why do you like pygmies so much?
     **Martin:** They're short and they blow darts.  What's not to like?
    
    _CUT TO: the roof of the Elliot Bay Towers.  
    Martin comes out the access door._
     **Martin:** Come on, come on up here.
      **Niles:** What could possibly be so important for me to see up here?
     **Martin:** The guy in 1708 got some homing pigeons.  He built a coop up
             here for them.
      **Niles:**[_coming up_] Pigeons?  I don't like pigeons, they have no
             respect for public art.
     **Martin:** Trust me, you're gonna like this.
      **Niles:** Dad, I don't think I handled things very well today.  Do you
             think Daphne will ever forgive me?
     **Martin:** Why don't you ask her for yourself?
    _Niles leans past the door to see Daphne.  She is sitting at a table
    set up for a dinner.  There are candles all around.  Frasier pours the
    champagne, then starts some music._
    **Frasier:** Your table is ready, sir.
      **Niles:** You look stunning.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.  You look dashing.
    **Frasier:**[_holding a chair for Niles to sit_] I trust this will be to
             your liking?
      **Niles:** Everything is to my liking.
     **Daphne:** Looks like we're having that first date after all.
      **Niles:** You went to so much trouble!
     **Daphne:** It wasn't me, it was your brother.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know me, I hate to butt in.
      **Niles:** Oh...
    **Frasier:** I had planned to take Daphne to dinner, when suddenly 
             inspiration struck.  Since you two couldn't go to Au Pied 
             du Cochon this evening, my faithful companion [_Martin bows._] 
             and I would bring it to you courtesy of their caterer.  If
             dancing at the Starlight Room was impossible, we'd give you
             the real thing.
     **Daphne:** It's all so overwhelming.
      **Niles:** Frasier, Dad, I don't know what to say.  You even got that
             man to move his pigeons.
     **Martin:** There were no pigeons.
      **Niles:** Ohhh...
     **Daphne:** How can we ever thank you two?
    **Frasier:** Just have a beautiful evening.
      **Niles:** I think we can do that.  And Frasier, listen...
    
    _Martin and Frasier head for the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Apology accepted, Niles.  Oh, just remember to give the
             lingonberry sauce a little stir...
     **Martin:** They can figure it out.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    
    _He follows Martin inside._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne, about today...
     **Daphne:** Let's just forget about that.  Why don't we start from here?
      **Niles:** I would love that.  To us!
     **Daphne:** To us.
    
    _They touch glasses and drink, then they lean in and kiss._
    
     **Daphne:** I'm usually so nervous on a first date.  But not tonight.
      **Niles:** Would you like to dance?
     **Daphne:** I'd love to.
    _They get up and start dancing.  Slowly the camera rises from the room 
    and backdrops them against the Seattle night._
    
      **Niles:** So where you from?
     **Daphne:** Manchester, England.
      **Niles:** Oh, my.  Big family?
     **Daphne:** Hideously.  And you?
      **Niles:** I'm from a small mountain village in Tibet.
    
    _She laughs._
    
      **Niles:** Tenzing Norgay used to carry me to school.
    
    _She laughs again._
    
      **Niles:** You know what I've always wondered?
     **Daphne:** I think I can guess.
      **Niles:** Yeah...
    
    _FADE OUT._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Simon comes up to the roof and sits at the table, tucking a napkin into
    his collar.  He scrapes the leftover food onto one plate and pours the
    champagne into one glass.  He polishes a fork on his shirt and finishes
    off the champagne in one drink.
