    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_
    _Fade in.  Frasier is sitting at the dining table, reading.  Daphne and
    Niles come in the front, wearing athletic clothes._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello
      **Niles:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Ah, the weekend warriors have returned.
     **Daphne:** Yeah.  You better watch out, Dr. Crane, I'm getting pretty
             good at kickboxing.
    
    _She does a high kick at him._
    
      **Niles:** It's true.  She hits so hard they're calling her "The British
             Pound."
     **Daphne:** You hit pretty hard yourself there, "Nails." [_She kisses him._] 
             I'm going to hop in the shower.
    
    _She heads for her room._
    
    **Frasier:** "Nails"?
      **Niles:** Oh, you scratch one guy... Oh, my electrolytes are plummeting.  
             Care to join me in a sherry?
    **Frasier:** Ah, actually, I'd love to, Niles, but I'm off to see Dr.
             Tewksbury.
    
    _He gets up and puts the book away._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, I didn't realize your mentor was still in town.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and because of it, I've been the fortunate recipient of 
             some informal therapy.  It's really been quite enlightening.  
             You know, I consider myself lucky to be in the hands of such 
             a master.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm happy for you, Frasier.  He is a gifted psychiatrist, 
             even if I don't share your god-like worship of him.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I simply have a healthy respect for the man, Niles.  
             It's hardly worship.
      **Niles:** Oh, please.  You're one step away from seeing his image appear 
             in a tortilla.
    
    _Daphne comes hurrying from her room in her bathrobe._
    
     **Daphne:** Niles, thank heavens you're still here!
      **Niles:** What's wrong?
     **Daphne:** You can't go to Nervosa today.
      **Niles:** Why not?
     **Daphne:** I just had a psychic vision that something bad's going to
             happen to you.
      **Niles:** Oh, come on, Daphne...
     **Daphne:** Niles, I'm serious!  I know you don't believe in visions, 
             but it's important to me.  Promise me you won't go.
      **Niles:** All right, if it means that much to you, I won't go.  I'll go
             straight home.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.  I feel much better. [_She gives him a kiss._] I'll
             see you later.
    
    _She heads to her room again.  Frasier opens the door and Niles turns
    to leave with him._
    
    **Frasier:** Wow, that was scary.
      **Niles:** Don't tell me you believe in that stuff...
    **Frasier:** No, I meant the way she can manipulate you like that.
      **Niles:** Oh, please, I was just being diplomatic.
    **Frasier:** Tell me, is it difficult to kickbox without a spine?
      **Niles:** You're gonna find out.
    
    _They exit.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 2 - Cafe Nervosa
    
    Fade in.  Frasier is sitting at a table, drinking coffee and reading.
    Roz comes in with some bags._
    
        **Roz:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Roz.  Oh, been on a shopping spree, I see.
        **Roz:** Yes, Alice is been visiting her grandmother for the week.
             So, I finally have some time to myself.  I tell you, it's
             great shopping without her pulling down a display rack.  Not
             only that, I actually woke up today without someone jumping
             on the bed and sticking her little fingers up my nose.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Roz:** And I didn't have to spend half the morning combing knots out
             of that little girl's curls...
    **Frasier:**[_hands her his cell phone_] Give Alice my love.
        **Roz:**[_getting up_] Thank you, I will.
    
    _Roz goes off to make her call.  Niles steps into the doorway._
    
      **Niles:** Psst, Frasier.  Can you get me a latte?
    **Frasier:** Why don't you just get it yourself, Niles?  Oh, that's right:
             it's bad moogambo for you to enter.
      **Niles:** You know I promised Daphne.
    **Frasier:**[_rising_] Yes, yes, and woe betide he who disobeyeth the oracle!
      **Niles:** All right, all right, wait.  Maybe if I get it to go, and
             don't sit down, I won't actually be breaking my promise to
             Daphne.
    **Frasier:** Step aside everybody, big set of onions coming through!
    
    _Niles gives him a dark look as he steps to the counter._
    
      **Niles:** Latte to go, please.
    
    _Frasier sits back down.  Dr. Tewksbury comes in._
    
    **Tewksbury:** Hello, Frasier.
      **Frasier:** Dr. Tewksbury.  Well, gosh, this is quite a surprise.  What
               are you doing here?
    **Tewksbury:** Well, I've heard you mention how good their coffee is here,
               I thought I'd give it a try.  May I join you?
    
    _As he sits, Roz and Niles both come over._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh, yes, of course.  I'm terribly sorry.  Oh, Roz, meet Dr.
               Tewksbury.  Dr. Tewksbury, this is my producer Roz Doyle.
               And my brother Niles.  Niles, Dr. Tewksbury.
        **Niles:** Hello, how do you do?
    **Tewksbury:** I don't believe we've ever met, but I seem to recall
               reading a fascinating paper of yours recently.
    
    _Niles seems flattered and reaches for a chair._
    
        **Niles:** Oh, yes, it was probably the one about phobias.  Oh, can't
               sit, can't sit.
      **Frasier:** It's a long story.  Anyway, Dr. Tewksbury, I was just 
               wondering, did you happen to read the article on behavior
               modification in...
    **Tewksbury:** Now, Frasier, let's not talk shop.  You don't want to bore
               Roz.
          **Roz:** Oh, it's all just white noise to me, now. [_Tewksbury laughs_]
      **Frasier:** Yes, all right.  Niles, please, would you stop hovering and
               please sit down?
        **Niles:** All right.  What could it hurt?
    
    _He sits down just as Daphne comes in the door._
    
     **Daphne:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Daphne!
    
    _He jumps up, banging his knee on the table._
    
     **Daphne:** How could you come down here?  You broke your promise!
      **Niles:** And my patella!
     **Daphne:** Well, nothing bad would have happened if you'd paid attention
             to my premonition!
      **Niles:** Well, actually, nothing bad would have happened if you hadn't
             shown up.
     **Daphne:** Well, it wouldn't have not happened had I not shown up.
      **Niles:** Well, it wouldn't not have happened if you hadn't not shown
             up!
     **Daphne:** And I wouldn't have shown up had I not known that you wouldn't
             have been able to not come down here!
      **Niles:** Well, I'm not... not... not... what?
     **Daphne:** My point exactly!  You don't listen.
    _She rushes out. Niles tries to follow her but stops from the pain._
    
        **Niles:** Daphne!
      **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, you all right?
        **Niles:** Oh, no, I've aggravated my old bossa nova injury.
      **Frasier:** Well, perhaps I better drive you.  I'm sorry, Dr. Tewksbury.
    **Tewksbury:** I understand.  
      **Frasier:** Bye, Roz.
          **Roz:** Bye! 
    
    _Frasier helps Niles out the door._
    
    **Tewksbury:** Well, what was that all about?
          **Roz:** Well, she thinks she's psychic, but he doesn't believe her.
    **Tewksbury:** Well, no matter who's right or wrong, Niles needs to set up 
               stricter boundaries with his patients.  I learned that from 
               years of practice.
          **Roz:** No, no.  She's not his patient, she's his girlfriend.
    **Tewksbury:** Oh, well in that case, no matter who's right or wrong, 
               HE's wrong.  I learned that from years of marriage.
    
    _Roz laughs.  FADE OUT._
    
    **DON'T FORGET
    THE GEIGER COUNTER
    AND THE DIVINING ROD**
    
    _Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    _Fade in.  Niles is on the couch, Frasier is by the bookcase._
    
    **Frasier:** Is there anything I can get you, Niles?  Perhaps a cold pack,
             perhaps?
      **Niles:** No, no.  If Daphne ever comes out of her room, I'll just use
             her icy stare.  Frasier, if you don't mind, I'm going to have
             to cancel on the opera tonight.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, you know I hate going to the opera alone.
             Throwing a woman's shawl over the seat next to me and
             glancing expectantly back at the ladies room all night.
      **Niles:** You do that?
    **Frasier:** No!
      **Niles:** Hey, why don't you ask Dr. Tewksbury if he'd like to go?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no.
      **Niles:** Oh, come on.  Ever since his divorce I'm sure he's anxious
             to get out of the house.
    **Frasier:** Well, we're in a quasi-therapeutic relationship right now.
             Truth be told, I was actually a little uncomfortable
             socializing with him at Nervosa.
      **Niles:** Oh, I understand.  You don't want to see the wizard behind
             the curtain.  Everyone needs an idol, someone who represents
             a higher plateau of truth and knowledge.
    **Frasier:** Very insightful, Niles.  For so many years I must have
             represented that plateau to you.
      **Niles:** Thank you, Frasier, laughter is indeed the best medicine.
    
    _They share a chuckle.  Daphne comes in from her room._
     
      **Niles:**[_rising_] Oh, Daphne.  My knee's feeling much better.
     **Daphne:**[_deadpan_] Oh, good.
    
    _She goes into the kitchen._
    
      **Niles:** Well I hope she doesn't expect me to run in there after her.
    **Frasier:** Good for you, Niles!
      **Niles:** With this knee I can only hobble.
    
    _And he proceeds to hobble in there after her.  
    
    Reset to: the kitchen as he enters._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne, I'm sorry.
     **Daphne:** Are you sorry for breaking your promise or for not believing
             me?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry for breaking my promise.
     **Daphne:** So you still don't believe I had a premonition?
      **Niles:** Well, it wasn't a premonition...
     **Daphne:** It certainly was!  I told you if you went to Nervosa, something 
             bad would happen, and you hurt your knee.  What more proof do 
             you need?
      **Niles:** Something a little more scientific than that, I'm afraid.
     **Daphne:** You need scientific proof?  Well, I think we can do something
             about that.
      **Niles:** What do you mean?
     **Daphne:** There are people around who do this sort of research.
      **Niles:** Are those people here now?
    
    _He smiles and she smacks his arm._
    
     **Daphne:** No!  I'm talking about legitimate professionals.
      **Niles:** All right, all right.  But it has to be a real scientist.  
             Not some huckster who comes here with crystals and a ghost-
             o-meter.
     **Daphne:** As long as you have an open mind.  And it's pronounced
             "ghost-ah-meters".
      **Niles:** I'm glad we worked this out.
     **Daphne:** Me too.
      **Niles:** And now that we've made up, maybe we could...
    
    _He grins suggestively._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I guess we know who's not psychic.
    
    _She walks out as Niles bemoans another lost moment.  FADE OUT._
    
    **THE DOCTOR MAKES
    A HOUSE CALL**
    
    _Scene 4 - Roz's Apartment -- a few days later_
    
    _Fade in.  There is a knock at the door.  Roz, in her nightgown and
    robe, opens the door to reveal Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier!  I thought you were the pizza guy.
    **Frasier:** I thought we were writing promos tonight.  You forgot, didn't
             you?
        **Roz:** NO!  Yes.  I'm sorry.
    _Dr. Tewksbury comes in from the other room wearing one of Roz's short
    silk robes._
    
    **Tewksbury:** Pizza!  We're gonna have pizza!  We... [_stops and puts on 
               his glasses_] Frasier!  Hello.  What are you doing here?
      **Frasier:** Oh, just, ah... wearing clothes.
    **Tewksbury:** Oh, right.
          **Roz:** Frasier brought over some work from the office.
    **Tewksbury:** Ah.  I'll just... go get dressed.
    
    _He hurries off to the other room.  Roz turns back to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** I've gone blind.  And ten seconds too late.  So, since when
             have you and Dr. Tewksbury been seeing each other?
        **Roz:** Well, uh, the other day at Nervosa we really hit it off after
             you left and he asked me out for dinner and... we've been out
             every night since.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, I must say I'm a bit surprised.
        **Roz:** Why?  He's smart, very insightful. and he's such a great
             listener.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I'm happy for you, Roz.  It's just a little
             difficult imagining the two of you together.
        **Roz:** You don't think I can appreciate a sophisticated man?  You
             know, it's not just about sex for me, Frasier.
    
    _Dr. Tewksbury comes back in._
    
    **Tewksbury:** Uh, do you have a stepladder?  My pants are stuck in the
               ceiling fan.
    
    _Roz and Frasier share a look and, realizing neither is really the
    winner, Frasier walks off and Roz closes the door.  FADE OUT._
    
    _Scene 5 - Dr. Tewksbury's Office_
    _Fade in.  Frasier is settling down with Dr. Tewksbury for a session._
    **Tewksbury:** Frasier, listen.  Before we begin, I hope it wasn't too
               awkward seeing me with Roz last night.
      **Frasier:** Not at all.  Well, it was just a little... jarring to see 
               you out of context that way.  But your personal life is 
               your business.  Speaking of which, let's, let's get down 
               to business: The Crane mind!
    **Tewksbury:** Yes, let us.
    _Looking at Dr. Tewksbury, Frasier gets a flash of him in Roz's robe._
    **Tewksbury:** Now, last time we had just broached the subject of your
               father's expectations and their effect on your early 
               adulthood.
    _Frasier tries to control his upset at the image of the robed doctor,
    unsuccessfully.  He grows more uncomfortable as Tewksbury sits on the
    desk and puts a hand behind his head._
    
    **Tewksbury:** As we know, the internalization of a parent's moral code is 
               crucial to the development of a superego.  And considering 
               the strict nature of your father's strictness...  Frasier, 
               is everything all right?
    
    _Frasier again sees Tewksbury in his suit._
    
      **Frasier:** Yes, yes, of course.  Please, continue.
    **Tewksbury:** Well you must admit that having a father whose very job 
               is the enforcement of the moral code, would lead to an 
               overdeveloped superego.
    
    _As he leans across the desk, the image of him in the robe once again
    appears to Frasier._
    
    **Tewksbury:** I believe I have a paper on this subject.
    
    _He goes to a filing cabinet and leans down to the bottom drawer,
    making Frasier VERY uncomfortable._
    
    **Tewksbury:** It's right here.
    
    _Frasier tries to look away and back, but the image won't go away.
    FADE OUT.
    
    End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    _Fade in.  Martin is sitting in his chair, reading.  Frasier comes in
    the front door._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** How was your day?
     **Martin:** Why don't you just tell me what happened to you?
    **Frasier:** What are you talking about?
     **Martin:** Well, you know how my day goes: play with Eddie, watch TV,
             do my stretches.  You only ask so I'll ask you about your
             day, so I'm askin'.
    **Frasier:** I am hurt.  You're my father, of course I care about your day.
    
    _He sits on the couch._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, well, uh, I played with Eddie, watched TV, did my 
             stretches.
    **Frasier:** Oh, good.
     **Martin:** So, how was...
    **Frasier:** I just came from Dr. Tewksbury.  Throughout the entire session, 
             I just couldn't focus on anything he was saying.
     **Martin:** Wasn't he talkin' about you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, but recently I saw him in... well, a less than
             dignified light.  And ever since, I've just found it
             impossible to take him seriously.
     **Martin:** I know exactly what you're talking about.  In Korea, I had
             this commanding officer, Lieutenant Franks.  I would have
             followed that guy into the gates of hell.  I saw him a few
             years later, he was flippin' hamburgers in a fast food place.
             That was hard to handle.  I mean this guy took me under his
             wing and molded me.
    **Frasier:** Like a mentor?
     **Martin:** Yeah, exactly.  He always used to say that one day he'd be
             takin' orders from me.  I just never thought it'd be for
             extra onions.
    **Frasier:** So how did you handle it?
     **Martin:** Well, I just realized it was my problem, not his.  And I
             wasn't gonna let it erase all that he'd meant to me.  So 
             I marched right back into that kitchen and saluted him.  
             And after we were talkin' a while, I realized nothin' had 
             changed.  He was still the same hard-chargin' man's man 
             who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty.  Which is why I 
             never ate there again.
    
    _Frasier and Martin share a laugh.  Daphne and Niles come in from 
    her room._
    
      **Niles:** Uh, if you two don't mind, Daphne's psychic evaluator is on
             the way over and we'd like to use the living room.
     **Martin:**[_rising_] Ooh, fine by me.  That stuff creeps me out anyway.
    **Frasier:** Niles I still can't believe you ever agreed to this.  Those
             tests are based on nothing more than subjective evidence and
             lucky guesses.
     **Daphne:** Yes, nothing at all like the subjective evidence and lucky
             guesses psychiatry is based on.
     **Martin:**[_smugly_] Thank you.
    
    _He goes off to his room._
    
      **Niles:** Don't worry, I will thoroughly appraise the examiner and his
             testing methods.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Good luck.
    
    _He leaves._
    
      **Niles:** That'll be him.
    
    _Niles opens the door.  The researcher is there._
    
      **Niles:** Come in.  I'm Dr. Niles Crane, this is Daphne Moon.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
      **Morey:** Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Morey.
      **Niles:** Oh, doctor?  Doctor of...?
      **Morey:** Spookology! [_then_] Kidding.  That's just what most people 
             expect.  Actually I'm a professor of psychiatry at Seattle 
             University.
      **Niles:** Really?  Please, have a seat.
      **Morey:** Thank you.
      **Niles:** So, hmm, you're more of a debunker.
      **Morey:** Well, no, not at all.  Actually, I apply scientific principles
             to the search for paranormal phenomena.  Believe me, nothing
             would make me happier than discovering a legitimate psychic.
    
    _He sits._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, so, then you've never found one.
      **Morey:** Well, if by "psychic" you mean people with above-normal
             prescience, then a few.  If you mean somebody who could 
             beat the house in Vegas, then no.  I thought I had one 
             for a while, but, uh... no.
      **Niles:** So, Daphne, do you still want to go through with this?
     **Daphne:** I'm ready if you are.
      **Niles:** All right, Doctor, she's all yours.
      **Morey:** Great.  Now, I've got a card...
     **Daphne:** Ace of spades!
      **Morey:**...with my office and fax number on it.
     **Daphne:** And your address!
      **Morey:** Correct.
    
    _He hands the card to Niles.  
    
    DISSOLVE TO: later, 
    
    Daphne and Morey are at the dining table and he's giving her a standard 
    test with cards._
    
     **Daphne:** Star...  Circle.
      **Morey:** And finally?
     **Daphne:** Circle.
      **Morey:** That's it.  That was your final test.
     **Daphne:** And I'm psychic, right?
      **Morey:** Well, first we have to compare your results to those of the
             rest of the control group.  It'll just take me a few minutes
             to run these numbers, okay?
    
    _Daphne gets up and goes over to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** So?  How do you think you did?
     **Daphne:** I think I did pretty well on the cards.  The premonition test
             was a little tricky, but all in all I was in the zone.
      **Niles:** Well, we'll soon find out.
      **Morey:** You know, Daphne, I'm always curious: when was it that you
             first suspected you had psychic ability?
     **Daphne:** Oh, years ago, when I was a little girl.  Grammy Moon first 
             saw the gift in me.  See, I was a girl in a house full of 
             boys, which I hated, until Grammy told me that only Moon women
             had second sight.  She had it, her mother had it and so on.
             After that, I noticed I could sense things before they
             happened, sort of like a secret power.  Anyway, it's just
             always been a part of who I am.
      **Morey:** I see.  Well, we have your results.
     **Daphne:** All right.  I don't know why I'm a bit nervous.
      **Morey:** So, Daphne, from what I see here...
      **Niles:** Wait, uh...  Wait.  I don't think we should this, I don't want
             to know.
     **Daphne:** What do you mean?
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I think this was a bad idea.
     **Daphne:** Well, I thought you wanted scientific proof.
      **Niles:** I changed my mind.  I don't need a stranger telling me...
             anything about who you are.  I want us to get to know each
             other on our own.  Over time.
     **Daphne:** I knew you were going to say that!
      **Niles:** You did?
     **Daphne:** No, but I loved hearing it.
    
    _She kisses him._
    
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, Dr. Morey, we wasted your time.
      **Morey:** It's okay.  The dog told me a couple of funny jokes while we
             were waiting.
    
    _Niles and Daphne look unsure about this._
    
      **Morey:** I'm kidding.  They weren't that funny.
    
    _Daphne and Niles aren't quite sure how to react.  FADE OUT._
    
    **THE BIG CITY PROVES
    TOO MUCH FOR PETERSON**
    
    _Scene 2 - Tewksbury's Office_
    
    _Fade in.  Frasier is again sitting in front of Tewksbury's desk,
    receiving analysis._
    
    **Tewksbury:** All right, Frasier, let's start with our last session.  
               As I recall, you were having difficulty getting rid of 
               a certain image in your mind?
      **Frasier:** That is correct.
    **Tewksbury:** Well, perhaps we should confront that.
    
    _He pulls out the robe._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh, dear lord, I assumed that was Roz's.
    **Tewksbury:** It is.  I was at her apartment this morning, I started
               thinking about your issue with the robe, and I decided 
               to bring it with me. [_He puts the robe on._] Now Frasier,
               you consider me a competent psychiatrist, don't you?
      **Frasier:** Of course I do.
    **Tewksbury:** Does seeing me dressed like this diminish that?
      **Frasier:** No, of course not.  It's just, well... I know, on a conscious 
               level, that the garment does not change who you are.  But 
               on, on an unconscious level, I'm all weirded out!  You're 
               my mentor, and you're wearing Roz's robe.
    **Tewksbury:** I'm still the same person.
      **Frasier:** Yes, but, it's Roz's robe.
    **Tewksbury:** And what does Roz's robe signify to you?
    
    _Tewksbury begins to pace._
    
      **Frasier:** Roz.
    **Tewksbury:** Then maybe this isn't about you and me.  Maybe this is
               about your relationship with Roz.
    
    _While Tewksbury's back is turned, a student comes in the door._
    
    **Tewksbury:** Seeing me dressed like this brings up deep feelings.  Don't
               be afraid of those feelings, go with them. [_He notices the
               student._] Ah, Peterson.  Here for your make-up test?
     **Peterson:** I was.  But I'll just take the D.
    _He leaves.  Frasier and Tewksbury both realize there's not a lot they
    can say.  
    
    FADE OUT._
    
    Scene 3 - Roz's Apartment
    
    _Fade in.  There is a knock at the door, Roz answers it to reveal
    Frasier._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** You got a minute?
        **Roz:** We're not supposed to be working, are we?  'Cause I'm kinda
             busy right now.
    **Frasier:** It's not about work.
        **Roz:** Oh, come on in.
    
    _He enters._
    
        **Roz:** Have a seat.
    **Frasier:** Thanks.
    
    _They sit on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Listen, uh, something's been troubling me ever since I saw
             Dr. Tewksbury in your robe and, uh, at first I thought it was
             about the toppling of a hero, but I've since discovered that
             it's really about you.
        **Roz:** Let me guess: I'm not good enough for your precious mentor.
    **Frasier:** No, that's not it, Roz.  Uh...  When you were describing what
             attracted you to Dr. Tewksbury, I couldn't help thinking
             "That very well could have been me."
        **Roz:** So?
    **Frasier:** So, Roz, I've known you for, what, eight years now.  And in
             that time I've seen you date hundreds of...
        **Roz:** Careful!
    **Frasier:** All right, dozens of men.  Yet you never showed any interest
             in me.  Well, except for that one drunken flirtation at the
             station retreat.
    
    _The laugh at the memory._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, anyway, I assumed it was because I wasn't your type.
             Then I see you drawn to someone who's similar to me.
        **Roz:** You're jealous?
    **Frasier:** Well, no, not jealous, not exactly.  It's more along the
             lines of "Why everybody else and not me?"
        **Roz:** Frasier, did you ever stop to think there may be something
             special about not being picked?
    **Frasier:** Roz, that didn't work when I was cut from pee-wee football,
             it's not gonna work now.
        **Roz:** Okay, I'll be honest with you.  When we first started working
             together, I had a little crush on you.
    **Frasier:** Really?
        **Roz:** Yeah, sure.  I mean, you were handsome and sophisticated and
             you had your French suits and your Italian shoes...
    **Frasier:** Actually, it was vice-versa, but go on, go on.
        **Roz:** But you were coming off this divorce, and you were my boss,
             and the whole thing was just too weird, so I never acted on
             it.
    **Frasier:** And you were right.  You were.  Anyway, it's nice to know how
             you felt.  Thanks.
        **Roz:** Sure.
    
    _They hug._
    
    **Frasier:** So, just for the record, though: you did have the hots for
             me?
        **Roz:** Yes, yes.
    **Frasier:** You're not just saying that?
        **Roz:** No.  But, can you imagine the two of us together?
    **Frasier:** Oh, gosh, no. [_rising_] Strange idea, isn't it?
        **Roz:** Really strange.
    **Frasier:** Gosh, it's really hard to picture, isn't it?  Of course, I
             mean, it wouldn't be your problem.  It would be all me, trust
             me, all me.  I mean, you're a perfectly wonderful person.
        **Roz:** What are you doing?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm just saying how great you are.
        **Roz:** No, you're giving me the "It's not you, it's me" speech.  If
             anyone should be giving that speech, it's me, not you.
    **Frasier:** Well, whatever you have to tell yourself, Roz.
        **Roz:** All right, get out!
    **Frasier:** Sounds to me like somebody still has a soft spot for the ol'
             boss man.
        **Roz:** OUT!
    
    _She pushes him out and slams the door.  FADE OUT._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Roz is sitting with Tewksbury on her couch, he's in her robe again.
    She hands him a gift bag.  Looking in, he pulls out a nice man's robe.
    He thanks her, then sets it aside and goes back to watching television
    in her robe.  Roz seems a bit disturbed by this.
