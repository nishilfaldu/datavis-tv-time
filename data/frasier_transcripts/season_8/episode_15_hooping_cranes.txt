    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Apartment
    Frasier opens the door to Roz, holding an envelope._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, to what to I owe the pleasure?
        **Roz:** A messenger delivered this for you after you left.  It's 
             marked "Personal and Confidential."  I thought it might be 
             important.
    
    _He holds the letter up to the light, trying to see through it._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, I already tried that, forget it.  We could use some 
             brighter bulbs at the office.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, a brighter bulb wouldn't have admitted it. [_opens 
             the envelope_] Let's see - oh!  "Dear Dr. Crane, enclosed are 
             four tickets to tonight's Sonics game as thanks for your advice 
             on today's show.  Sincerely, Allen from Earlemont."
        **Roz:** That is gonna be a great game!  You should take your dad 
             and have a boy's night out.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually Niles and I are already having a boy's night 
             out.  We're gonna go see the Northwest Chamber Ensemble's 
             Spring Sing.  After that, a late dinner at Le Cigare Volant!
        **Roz:** Ooh, throw in a couple of strippers and that still sounds 
             boring.
    **Frasier:** And to think I was going to offer you these basketball tickets.
        **Roz:** Well, can't use 'em anyway.  I have a date with this French 
             guy.
    **Frasier:** So that's it, huh?  No Americans left.
        **Roz:** That's very funny.  You know, I hope it goes well, because 
             he doesn't speak any English, and the only French I know is 
             _"oui"_ and _"non."_
    **Frasier:** I suppose you'll just be using one of those.
        **Roz:** Before you get too clever, you're the one who's going out 
             with his brother.
    **Frasier:**[_can say nothing but_] Have a nice date, Roz.
    
    _She leaves.  Martin comes out._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad, I've got something here that I think you might be 
             interested in.
     **Martin:** Whoa-ho!  Sonics tickets, how about that!  Well, looks like 
             I owe you an apology!
    **Frasier:** An apology?
     **Martin:** Well, last October you said we would go to a game together, 
             but I thought that was just a lot of talk.
    **Frasier:** Well, listen Dad, I intended to-
     **Martin:** Well, it doesn't matter how long it took.  You came through, 
             that's what's important.
    **Frasier:**[_trapped_] Glad to see you're so excited.
     **Martin:** Well, who wouldn't be? [_checks the tickets_] Oh, look where 
             we're sitting!  Oh Frasier, you're the best!
    **Frasier:** Listen Dad, there's something you should know-
    
    _Martin hugs him joyfully._
    
    **Frasier:** You're paying for the snacks.
     **Martin:** All right!  Well, we'd better get going!  Who are the other 
             tickets for?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, [_the doorbell rings_] they're for, uh, Niles and 
             Daphne, of course.  But, um, I made the arrangements so 
             long ago I didn't anticipate Daphne going for her master's 
             degree at the Fat Academy.
    
    [_N.B. Jane Leeves does not appear - Daphne is away at "reducing" camp._]
    _Martin puts on his letterman jacket._
    
    **Frasier:** But, uh, you know, Dad, uh, why don't I let Niles in, and then 
             you can go get ready, all right?
     **Martin:** I am ready.
    **Frasier:** Don't you want to take your big foam finger?
     **Martin:** Well, I got some nacho cheese on it last time, it smells 
             kind of funky.
    
    _The doorbell rings twice._
    
    **Frasier:**[_tries to sound cheerful_] This is gonna be fun!
    
    _He opens the door to Niles._
    
      **Niles:** Oh good, for a moment I'd thought you'd left.  You have the 
             tickets?
     **Martin:** Right here, we're good to go!
      **Niles:** Dad's going with us?
    **Frasier:** Yes, all three of us!
     **Martin:** Well, we'd better get a move on, I'd like to get there early 
             and see the players warm up.
      **Niles:** Hey, me too! [_to Frasier_] What a surprise this is!
    **Frasier:** Yes, just you wait!
    
    _They head out the door.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **HOOPING CRANES**
    
    _Scene Two - Stadium
    The stadium is packed with roaring fans, and the game is in full swing.  
    Frasier and Niles come down to four empty seats next to the aisle._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, here we are, Row four.  Here look, why don't we let Dad 
             sit between us?
      **Niles:** Good idea.
    
    _Frasier takes the aisle seat, Niles takes the second one over._
    
    **Announcer:**[_over P.A._] Now entering for the Sonics, Number Thirty-One, 
               Brent Barry!
    
    _The crowd cheers._
    
      **Niles:** It's like those family road trips Dad used to drag us on.  
             Uncomfortable seats, sticky floors, underlying threat of 
             violence.
    **Frasier:** However did we get through those?
      **Niles:** Games, mostly.  License plate spotting, I Spy, throwing up.
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, that wouldn't be so much a game as an 
             activity.
    
    _Martin comes down with three large beers on a tray._
    
     **Martin:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Dad.
     **Martin:** I sold the other ticket.
    **Frasier:** Oh good, what'd you get for it?
     **Martin:** Oh, these three frosty fellows and a chili dog that didn't 
             make it.
    **Frasier:**[_takes a beer_] Thank you.
     **Martin:**[_sits in the middle seat_] Oh great, I didn't miss much.
    _As he watches the game, Frasier and Niles revert to habit, annoying him._
    **Frasier:** I spy, with my little eye, something beginning with "V."
      **Niles:**[_looking around_] Vagabond.
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** Vittles.
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** Vienna sausages.
    **Frasier:** Where do you see Vienna sausages?
      **Niles:** Well, I thought maybe that vendor might - oh, oh!  
             "Vendor, vendor!"
    **Frasier:** Excellent, Niles!  Your turn.
      **Niles:** I spy, with my little eye-
     **Martin:** Would you cut it out, I'm trying to watch the game!
    **Frasier:** We're just playing I Spy, Dad.
     **Martin:** I know, and it's distracting.
      **Niles:** Well, we used to do it all the time on family vacations.
     **Martin:** And it was distracting then, so cut it out, or it'll end up 
             like our family trip to Arizona.
      **Niles:** You mean you'll turn around in your seat and almost drive the 
             arena into the Grand Canyon?
    **Frasier:** Tell you what, Dad, here. [_getting up_] Why don't you switch 
             seats with me, and that way we won't disturb you?
     **Martin:** All right, OK.
    _They switch, putting Martin in the aisle seat, and Frasier between him 
    and Niles.  A heavyset woman wearing a Sonics windbreaker and baseball 
    cap comes down with a large beer, and shuffles past them into the seat 
    next to Niles._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, here's the lady who bought my ticket.  I see you got 
             yourself some suds there, huh?
        **Fan:** Oh, you know it!  You can't watch the Sonics without a beer 
             or two! [_to Niles_] Especially this season, you know what I'm 
             saying, huh?
      **Niles:** Yes, might I. [_to Frasier_] I spy-
        **Fan:** COME ON, BEECHAM, MOVE THAT SIDE OF BEEF DOWN THERE 
             AND PLAY SOME DE-FENSE!
    _Niles rears back like a man trapped in a cave with an as-yet distracted 
    lion._
    
        **Fan:** Come on, come on... YEAH-AAAAAHHHH!
    _She turns to Niles and throws up her hand for a hi-five, causing him 
    to gasp and cringe.  He weakly slaps her hand, then turns to Frasier._
      **Niles:** Switch seats with me.
        **Fan:** COME ON, HUSTLE!  LET'S SEE SOME BALL MOVEMENT!
    **Frasier:**[_no fool_] I'm going to say no.
      **Niles:** Well, there's no way I'm enduring this for... however long 
             this thing lasts!  Uh, Dad, Dad, I'm sorry, eh, my leg is 
             getting a little stiff.  Would you mind switching seats with 
             me so I can stretch it out?
     **Martin:** Oh, stiff leg, huh?  Must have been that bullet you had pumped 
             into you while stopping a robbery.  Oh no, wait, that was me!
      **Niles:** Dad?
     **Martin:** Oh, all right, all right, but this is the last time I'm moving.
      **Niles:** All right, just uh, you go in there, and I'll step through 
             here.
    
    _Niles and Martin get up and awkwardly shuffle past each other.  
    Now Niles is in the aisle seat._
    
      **Niles:** Ow, oh, my leg's very tender. [_sits down_] Oh well, better!
    **Frasier:** Niles, my legs are much longer than yours.
      **Niles:** So?
    **Frasier:** So I should be sitting in that seat.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm not switching.
    **Frasier:** It was mine to begin with.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm still not switching.  I spy, with my little eye-
    **Frasier:** I'm not playing.
      **Niles:** Fine.
    **Frasier:** Fine.
    
    _Niles opens his mouth and stretches his lips like a fish._
    
    **Frasier:** Now what are you doing?
      **Niles:** I'm staving off chapping.  It's very dry in here, and I don't 
             have any lip balm.
    **Frasier:**[_takes out a little jar_] I do. [_Niles reaches for it, but he 
             pulls it away_] Switch seats with me.
      **Niles:** My integrity is not for sale.
    **Frasier:** Suit yourself. [_takes some balm and slowly applies it to his 
             own lips_] Oh my, these rich, waxy emollients are delightfully 
             soothing...
      **Niles:** All right, you can have the seat, for goodness's sake, here!  
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
    
    _They switch, putting Niles in the second seat from the aisle._
    
        **Niles:** Give me that. [_takes the balm and starts applying it_]
    **Announcer:** Ladies and gentlemen, check your seat number!  At half-time, 
               one lucky fan will be taking your Northwest Cable's half-
               court shot!  Are you ready?  If your seat is Section 101-
    
    _Martin and the Fan sit up, excited._
    
    **Announcer:** Row 4-
    
    _Even more excited._
    
    **Announcer:** Seat 2, congratulations!
    _On the huge roof-mounted TV screen, there is a shot centered on Niles, 
    obliviously balming his lips, framed by the flashing message, "WE GOT
    A SHOOTER!" As Martin slaps his back and points up towards the camera, 
    he slowly raises his head.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Three - Stadium
    Niles is standing up, next to a P.R. Woman with a clipboard 
    and a basketball jersey._
    
    **Frasier:** Good luck, Niles.
      **Niles:** Thanks, Frasier.
     **Martin:** Praying, Niles.
      **Niles:** Thanks, Dad.
      **Woman:** Come on, right this way. [_holds up clipboard_] Now, we need you 
             to sign this release form.
      **Niles:** Why, what happened?
      **Woman:** No, it's just so we can use your image on television. [_points_] 
             Right there is fine. [_he signs it_] OK, now I need you to put 
             this on.
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, OK, sure, uh, let me just- [_takes off his suit jacket_] 
             Can I undo this?
      **Woman:** Absolutely.  Are you OK?
    _Niles wrestles his arms and head through the jersey, a garment about as 
    familiar to him as a brassiere._
    
      **Niles:**[_tangled_] I just haven't done a lot of basket-balling.  
             I'm just a bit nervous.
      **Woman:** Ah, don't worry.  Nobody makes the shot.
      **Niles:** Yes, well I'm not even sure I can roll it that far...
    
    _Just as Niles almost has his head through, a loud buzzer sounds, 
    making him jump._
    
      **Niles:** What's that?!
      **Woman:** Oh, that's nothing.  It's just half-time.
    _He finally gets the jersey down over his head, and she leads him down 
    to the court._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank God we switched seats, that could be me down there!  
             Poor Niles!
     **Martin:** What do you mean?  Every guy dreams of a chance like this.
    **Frasier:** Dream or not, Dad, eventually he's going to try to take that 
             shot.  You know how Niles throws!
     **Martin:** Yeah, and you're Pete Maravich.
    **Frasier:** I don't know what that means.
     **Martin:** Well, it means instead of criticizing him you might be a 
             little more supportive.  Because, no matter what happens 
             down there, he's still your brother and my son.  
    
    _Niles and the Woman reach the court._
    
     **Martin:** Whoops, here we go.  Hand me his beer, I'm going to need it.
    
    **Announcer:** Ladies and gentlemen, here to attempt your Northwest Cable's 
               half-court shot, from right here in Seattle - Niles Crane!
    _Applause.  The stadium lights go out, except for two spotlights: 
    one on Niles, in the center of the court, and the other on the 
    basket, fifty feet away.  The P.R. Woman hands him a basketball._
    
      **Woman:** There you go, Niles.  Good luck.
    _She walks away.  Niles looks out at his invisible audience, and bows.
    
    The scene goes into SLOW MOTION, and the Chicago Bulls' intro music 
    begins to play over the soundtrack: 
    
    Niles dribbles the ball once, and it bounces back up into his hands.
    
    He flashes a grin at the stands.  Frasier and Martin are there, 
    cheering and holding up their thumbs.
    
    Niles dribbles the ball again.  It bounces away, and he lurches after 
    it.
    
    Frasier and Martin put their hands over their eyes.
    
    Niles gets the ball back, and tries several ready positions, holding 
    the ball behind his hip like a shot-putter, then over his shoulder like
    a quarterback.  Finally, he bows over, holds the ball between his legs,
    looks at the basket, takes a deep breath..._
    [_FULL-COURT SHOT - the camera wides to include both Niles and 
    the basket, meaning the following cannot be faked:_]
    _And does a full-body, underhand heave that sends the ball in an arc 
    towards the basket and swishing right through the string mesh.
    
    The crowd erupts into applause.  In the stands, Martin nearly has a 
    heart attack.  
    
    As Niles stands there stunned, the Sonics' Cheerleading Squad runs out 
    onto the court and mobs him.
    
    Martin and Frasier trade a look of amazement, then they rise with the 
    rest of the crowd, cheering.
    
    The camera revolves around Niles.  As the cheerleaders dance around
    him, his stupor gives way to realization, and then triumph.  
    He raises his arms in victory, and the applause becomes thunderous.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Apartment
    The Crane boys come back from the game._
    
    **Frasier:** Now entering the apartment, a 5'9'' psychiatrist from Seattle, 
             Niles Crane!
     **Martin:** Yahoo! [_as Niles hangs up his coat_] He shakes, he bakes, 
             he drives to the coat rack, he takes an arm out of the 
             sleeve, he puts it up... and IT'S GOOD!
      **Niles:** Thank you, Dad.
    **Frasier:**[_pouring sherry_] Glass of sherry, Niles?
      **Niles:** Please.
     **Martin:**[_as Niles takes the glass_] He holds the glass, goes up to the 
             sherry... IT'S GOOD!
      **Niles:** OK, Dad!
    **Frasier:** Gosh, Niles, you making that basket tonight was truly 
             astonishing.  And what's even more unbelievable is that 
             you are now the proud owner of a rugged, ram-tough, 
             all-terrain pickup truck.
      **Niles:** It occurred to me we could use it to go antiquing.
    **Frasier:** Ah! [_clinks his glass against Niles's_]
     **Martin:**[_checks the answering machine_] Whoa, fourteen messages, 
             new record! [_presses button_]
       **Duke:**[_on machine_] Hey Martin, it's Duke.  Was that Niles on Sports 
             Center, or am I drunk?  Call me. [_beep_]
      **Frank:**[_on machine_] Marty, it's Frank.  Bad news, Stosh had another 
             heart attack... he saw your son make that basket, it's the 
             greatest thing I've ever seen!  Uh, give me a call. [_beep_]
      **Stosh:**[_on machine_] Hey Marty, it's Stosh.  Bad news-
      **Frank:** I just did that one!
      **Stosh:** Oh, sorry.  Make sure you catch Sports Center!  Congrats. 
             [_beep_]
     **Martin:**[_stops the tape_] We'll listen to the rest of them later.  
             Oh Niles, I can't tell you how great you were tonight!
      **Niles:** Well, thanks Dad, but I wasn't great.  I just walked out on 
             the court and heaved the ball as hard as I could and the rest 
             was just luck.
    **Frasier:** Well, that may be so, Niles, but still and all you did go down 
             and do it.  Not many people could have done that.
     **Martin:** I know I always told you boys that sports aren't important... 
             but they are!  And what you did tonight out there makes me 
             really proud.
      **Niles:** Thanks.
    
    _Frasier is beginning to feel left behind and runs to catch up._
    
    **Frasier:** Good thing I wangled those tickets, eh, Dad?
     **Martin:**[_looks at the TV_] Oh look, Niles is on TV!  Oh, I can't 
             believe it, he made Player of the Week!  We've got us a 
             real-life celebrity in our own home! [_watching the replay_] 
             It's up... and IT'S GOOD!
    
    _Niles raises his arms in another victory gesture while Frasier 
    continues to stew.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **FRENCH KISS-OFF**
    
    _Scene Five - Caf e Nervosa
    Frasier is sitting at a table.  Niles comes in wearing a Sonics 
    letterman jacket._
    
      **Niles:**[_to counter person_] Excuse me, nonfat latte to go, please.  
             Hey Frasier, mind if I join you?
    _By now, Frasier is in familiar sibling-rivalry mode.  He slowly lowers 
    his newspaper, looks at Niles over the top of it, and purses his lips 
    at his jacket._
    
    **Frasier:** Are you sure?  The jocks usually sit over at that table.
      **Niles:** Oh, this thing, yes, well, this was just part of a gift package 
             the Sonics sent over.  
    
    _Before he sits down, he makes sure to turn around, showing "CRANE" 
    stenciled on the back._
    
      **Niles:** I just didn't want to seem ungrateful.  Not that I owe them 
             anything; after all, I'm the one that drained it from way 
             downtown.
    **Frasier:** Yes, so we've been hearing.
      **Niles:** Oh Frasier, don't grouse.  I've earmarked a pair of practice 
             pants for you.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Niles, but I'd like to think I've already mastered 
             pants.  I assume you're going to select a more appropriate 
             jacket for this evening's concert?
      **Niles:** Oh yeah, about that - Dad wants me to go with him to McGinty's 
             so he can have me tell the tale.
    **Frasier:** But Niles, we've already rescheduled the concert once!
      **Niles:** Well, that was because of you.
    **Frasier:** Well, not because of me, it was because of Dad.
      **Niles:** Well, so is McGinty's.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not the same!  We had an agreement!  If you 
             should choose to dishonor it, there will be consequences.
      **Niles:** Why don't we compromise?  
    **Frasier:** Hmm?
      **Niles:** Let's say we go and have a drink with Dad at McGinty's, 
             and then afterwards proceed along to the concert?
    **Frasier:**[_fumbling_] Well, I just don't, I don't, uh, well, I - 
             all right, fine.
      **Niles:** I'll see you later, Frasier.
    
    _As he gets up, Roz comes into the caf e._
    
        **Roz:** Wow, Niles!  You finally made varsity after thirty years, huh?
      **Niles:** Yes, but it's not a real varsity jacket, Roz, so you're under 
             no obligation to sleep with me.
    
    _She smiles - "touch e."_
    
        **Roz:** See you around.
      **Niles:** Take care.
    
    _Niles leaves._
    
        **Roz:** Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** You may join me if you wish, Roz.  Be forewarned, I am feeling 
             a bit peevish.
        **Roz:**[_sitting_] Oh, for God's sake, you're like Goldilocks with that 
             latte.  "This foam is too hard, this foam is too soft"-
    **Frasier:** No, this is not about latte foam, Roz!  Ever since Niles made 
             that basket, his head's been getting bigger and bigger.
        **Roz:** Well, you have to admit it was pretty amazing.
    **Frasier:** Amazingly lucky!  To hear Niles tell it, it all started with 
             a little rubber factory in Sumatra, where an unsuspecting 
             basketball began a journey that would lead to greatness.
        **Roz:** So he's milking it a little bit, you'd do the same thing!
    **Frasier:** I would not!  I would treat it as the chance occurrence it 
             was... like finding a terrific parking spot in front of the 
             opera house.
        **Roz:**[_pouncing_] You bragged about that for weeks!
    **Frasier:** Well, it was right in front of the steps, Roz!
        **Roz:** You know what I mean, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I suppose I do.  Guess I'll just have to grin and bear it 
             for a little while longer.
    
    _Jean-Pierre, Roz's French boyfriend, comes into the caf e._
    
        **Roz:**[_gasps_] There's Jean-Pierre.
    **Frasier:** Oh, your French beau.  How's that going?
        **Roz:** I'm breaking up with him.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry.
        **Roz:** Actually, you're going to do it for me.
    **Frasier:** What?!
        **Roz:** I don't speak French!  I need you to translate-
    **Frasier:** For God's sake-
        **Roz:** Pleeease?
    **Frasier:** Well, all right!
    
    _Roz motions Jean-Pierre over to their table._
    
        **Roz:**[_cups a hand and yells in his ear_] We're having coffee!  
             Sit down!
    **Frasier:** I can't imagine why this isn't working.
    _Jean-Pierre sits at their table.  The substance of his and Frasier's 
    conversation appear in English subtitles at the bottom of the screen.
    
    Update 2010/8/8: Thanks to William Melvin for transcribing the
    French conversation between Frasier and Jean-Pierre and also 
    providing a literal translation, which differs from the subtitles._
            **Roz:** Jean-Pierre, this is Frasier.
        **Frasier:**[_shaking hands_]
                 Uh, C'est un plaisir de faire votre connaissance.
                 [subtitle: It's a pleasure to meet you.]
                 [literal: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.]
            **Roz:** Now I want to do this gently, so will you tell him that 
                 I think he's a really nice guy.
        **Frasier:** Uh-huh. Roz trouve que vous etes genial.
                 [subtitle: Roz thinks you're a great guy.]
                 [literal: Roz thinks that you're fantastic.]
    **Jean-Pierre:** Elle veut rompre avec moi, n'est-ce pas?
                 [subtitle: She wants to break up with me, doesn't she?]
                 [literal: She wants to break up with me, is that it?]_Frasier shrugs and nods._
    **Jean-Pierre:** Tant mieux! Elle n'est pas mon type. Ça fait quelque temps
                 que je cherche a m'en debarrasser.
                 [subtitle: Thank God, she's not my type.  I've been
                            looking for a way out for days.]
                 [literal: All the better! She's not my type. It's been a
                           while that I've been trying to get out of it.]
        **Roz:** What'd he say?
        **Frasier:** Um, he said that he-he's very fond of you too.
            **Roz:** OK, now tell him that these past few weeks... have been 
                 really fun.
        **Frasier:** You can go faster, Roz.
            **Roz:** Let me do this my way.  Tell him!
        **Frasier:** Uh, Voyez… elle a tout arrange. Si ça ne vous derange pas
                 de la laisser faire.****             [subtitle: Look… she's got all this worked out, if you
                            don't mind indulging her.]
                 [literal: Look… she's worked it all out. If it doesn't
                           bother you to let her do it.]
    **Jean-Pierre:** Je comprends. Dites-moi, ou peut-on manger un bon bifteck?****[subtitle: I understand.  Listen, where's a good place to
                            get a steak?]
                 [literal: I understand.  Tell me, where can you eat a
                           good steak?]
    _He reaches out and tenderly caresses Roz's cheek._
        **Frasier:** He says, what are you trying to say?
            **Roz:** OK.  Tell him, in another time, in another place, we might 
                 have a shot, but this just isn't working for me.
        **Frasier:** Les «Cinq Couronnes» sont excellent pour filet - la carte
                 des vins n'est pas mal non plus.
                 [subtitle: The Five Crowns has a great filet, and the
                            wine list isn't bad either.]
                 [literal: The "Five Crowns" are excellent for their
                           filet - the wine list isn't bad either.]_He looks at Roz._
        **Frasier:** Faire semblant de triste.
                 [subtitle: OK, look sad.]
                 [literal: Try to look sad.]
    _Jean-Pierre takes on a grave face.  Roz grimaces sympathetically._
    **Jean-Pierre:**[_sadly_] Est-ce qu'on peut fumer au restaurant?
                 [subtitle: Can you smoke in there?]
                 [literal: Can you smoke in the restaurant?]
        **Frasier:** Is there any chance you'd reconsider?
            **Roz:** I don't think so.
        **Frasier:** Oh. Vous pouvez fumer dans le patio.
                 [subtitle: You can smoke on the patio.]
                 [literal: You can smoke in the patio area.]
    _They rise._
            **Roz:** Is he OK?
        **Frasier:** Yes Roz, he'll be fine.  But, you know, I think for his 
                 sake we should wrap this up. [_they get up_]
            **Roz:** Jean-Pierre...
    **Jean-Pierre:** Roz... 
    
    _They embrace._
    
    **Jean-Pierre:**[_over her shoulder, to Frasier_]
                 Merci pour le conseil, je meurs de faim!
                 [subtitle: Thanks for the tip. God, I'm starving!]
                 [literal: Thanks for the advice, I'm dying of hunger!]
        **Frasier:** He says that he'll-
            **Roz:** Please, Frasier.  Some things don't need to be translated.
    
    _She kisses Jean-Pierre.  They exchange a faraway look, and 
    Jean-Pierre leaves.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - McGinty's
    Niles and Martin are seated at the bar, surrounded by appreciative 
    barflies.  They are watching a video of Niles's shot.  Frasier sits 
    behind Niles, writhing in envy._
    
    **Bartender:** So at this point, what were you thinking?
        **Niles:** Stop tape, please. [_the bartender does_]
       **Martin:** Boy, I'd be thinking about that sweet truck.
       **Barfly:** Yeah, me, too.
        **Niles:**[_chuckles_] Not me.  If you're focusing on the reward, that's 
               energy you're not using to make the shot.
       **Martin:** And you know what else?  He's donating that truck to the 
               Police Activities League!
        **Niles:** I just want the kids to know it's about the play-offs, 
               not the pay-offs.
       **Martin:** Is this a great boy, or what?  You sure I can't pay you for 
               this beer?
    **Bartender:** Hey, your money's no good here.  "Half-Court" Crane's dad 
               doesn't pay for drinks.
      **Frasier:** Excuse me, Niles, but we have a concert to make.
        **Niles:** Oh, I know, soon, soon.  I can't leave the fellas hanging, 
               Frasier.  Ah, back to the tape.  Now, that's about forty-
               five feet to that basket.  You see, I used my whole body, 
               form is everything.  You've already made or missed the shot 
               even before you release the ball.  And of course, we all 
               know the rest of the story.
      **Frasier:**[_can take no more_] Yes, yes!  The story is, "once upon a 
               time, Niles Crane accidentally made a basket, The End!"
    
    _Martin and the barflies react._
    
        **Niles:** I don't deny there was some luck involved, but as we all 
               know, luck is the residue of design.
    
    _The barflies nod sagely._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh, please!  Somehow managing to hurl a ball forward is 
               hardly design!
        **Niles:** You're just jealous because I have game and you don't.
      **Frasier:** Oh, please!  So you think you have game?
        **Niles:** I do, yea.
      **Frasier:** Oh-
    **Bartender:**[_to Martin_] Think they're gonna fight?
       **Martin:**[_wearily_] I got news for you, they are fighting.
      **Frasier:** We'll just see about that!  Barkeep!
       **Martin:** What are you doing?
    
    _Frasier puts a twenty-dollar bill on the bar and points to the 
    Mini-Hoop machine in the corner._
    
      **Frasier:** I am going to challenge Niles to a game of One-on-One 
               on that contraption over there.
       **Martin:**[_alarmed_] What do you want to do that for?!
      **Frasier:**[_to bartender_] Twenty dollars of your cleanest quarters!
       **Martin:** Well, whoa, what about your concert, you guys better 
               get moving, tick-tock!
        **Niles:** All right, Frasier, game on!
    _Frasier gets his change.  As they head over to the machine, 
    the barflies all watch with anticipation - except Martin, 
    who knows all too well what's going to happen._
    
       **Martin:** Oh wait, it's not worth it!  Sports aren't everything!
    
    _Frasier puts a quarter in, and receives a miniature basketball._
    
      **Frasier:** All right, hotshot, after you. [_Niles takes the ball_]
    **Bartender:** Let's go, Half-Court!  Put it up, baby! [_the barflies cheer_]
    
        **Niles:** Thank-thank you, I appreciate the support, but I think 
               I might throw better with fewer voices.
    _The barflies fall into a reverent silence.  While Frasier stands next 
    to the machine, Niles faces the basket, cocks his arm... and awkwardly 
    jerks the ball forward, missing the machine's cage entirely and bouncing 
    the ball off Frasier._
    
        **Niles:** Well, obviously I'm accustomed to shooting from further 
               back.
      **Frasier:** Yes, and just once!  Allow me.
    _Frasier takes the ball, stands in front of the cage, aims... and throws 
    just as awkwardly, missing the basket.  Martin puts a hand over his 
    face._
    
      **Frasier:** All right, your turn.
        **Niles:** All right, I believe I'm warmed up now.
    _He takes the ball again, and raises his leg to rest it on the front 
    of the machine.  He throws the ball and stumbles to the floor._
    
        **Niles:** Wait, yeah, I hit the round part, and that's worth, uh, 
               a half a point!
       **Martin:** I think I could use another beer.
    **Bartender:** That'll be $2.95.
    
    _Martin looks devastated.  He glares towards the boys as he angrily 
    yanks his wallet from his pocket.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **INSERT:**
    _We see a series of abortive takes of Scene Three, revealing that 
    it actually took David Hyde Pierce twenty-seven tries to make the 
    basket.  The shot was filmed on location at Los Angeles's Staples 
    Center on January 9th, 2001._
     
    **Credits:**
    
    The bar is now empty except for Frasier and Niles, still trying to 
    make one basket, and Martin, who is still at the bar.
    
    Niles tries winding up like a baseball pitcher before heaving the ball.
    As Frasier starts to take his shot, Niles fights with him, trying to 
    pull the ball away.  Frasier fights him off.
    
    The bartender puts a fresh beer in front of Martin.  He reaches for it, 
    but the ball flies over his shoulder, knocking the glass off the bar.  
    The bartender calmly refills the glass while Martin angrily yanks out 
    his wallet again and slaps some money down on the bar.
