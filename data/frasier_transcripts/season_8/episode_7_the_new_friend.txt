    **Skyline:** The full yellow moon rises over the skyline.
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - Restaurant
    Frasier is sat at a table in a crowded restaurant.  Several waiting 
    diners are standing around, glaring at him.  His cell phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Niles, you're forty minutes late!  Listen, I've just 
             finished my third basket of bread, and there is an angry mob 
             breathing down my neck.  What?  Oh, you've torn your trouser 
             cuff, I'm _so sorry_.  For God's sakes, will you hurry it up!  
             More hemming, less hawing!  All right, I'll hold our table.
    _Roz comes in wearing a slinky evening dress, accompanied by her new 
    boyfriend, Luke._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, Roz Doyle!
        **Roz:**[_to Luke_] I'll be right back. [_goes over to Frasier, nervous_] 
             Hi, Frasier.  I'm on a date, please don't screw it up.
    **Frasier:** No, I won't.  Niles is running a little late, and I-I was just 
             hoping maybe I could join you and your lucky chap for a drink 
             while I wait for him?
        **Roz:** I-I really don't think so, it's kind of a romantic evening, 
             and-
    **Frasier:** Roz, this crowd is starting to get ugly, would you please just 
             let me come over there till Niles gets here, please?
        **Roz:** Oh, all right!  Come on.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
    _Roz goes to join Luke.  As soon as Frasier moves, people start to look 
    at his table.  He hurriedly takes off his jacket, drapes it over his 
    chair, and sweeps the room with the protective glare of a lioness 
    guarding her cubs (that's how he would describe it, anyway).
    
    He sits with Luke and Roz._
    
    [_N.B. Gary Cole appeared in "In The Line Of Fire" with John Mahoney._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hi.
        **Roz:** Luke Parker, Frasier Crane, he's joining us for a quick drink.
       **Luke:** Oh, great!  I've heard your show, nice to meet you.
    **Frasier:** Oh, likewise.  So, uh, well, how did you two kids meet?
       **Luke:** Actually I just moved to Seattle a month ago.  I live on a 
             boat, and as I was pulling into the sloop, Roz was standing 
             right there on the dock.
    **Frasier:** Right there on the dock, you say?  Well...
        **Roz:** I do live next to the marina!
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes, yes, yes.  So Luke, you're a boat enthusiast?
       **Luke:** You know anything about boats?
    **Frasier:** Well actually, on my show I sometimes compare the human psyche 
             to a sailboat that's borne along the surface of the conscious 
             mind, while the deeper waters of the subconscious navigate the 
             rudder.
       **Luke:** So I guess the answer would be "no."
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    
    _Roz's pager beeps._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, my babysitter!  I'll be right back.
    **Frasier:** Right, of course.
    
    _Roz gets up and leaves the table._
    
       **Luke:** So...
    **Frasier:** So... you know, uh, actually I'm-I'm not a total stranger 
             to the old H20.  I did row Crew at Harvard.
       **Luke:** I went to Harvard!
    **Frasier:** Ah, Harvard.  Mmm, God, those were the best years of my life.  
             You know, there's nothing quite like that sense of accomplishment 
             you get when they actually hand you that diploma, is there?
       **Luke:** I dropped out.
    **Frasier:** Well, you didn't miss much.
       **Luke:** I just got frustrated reading about other people's experiences 
             and never having any of my own.  So I dropped out, I built my 
             own boat, and sailed around the world.  Yeah, sometimes there's 
             more adventure than I bargained for.  Like, uh, twenty-foot 
             seas off the Hebrides, or the time pirates rammed my boat and 
             robbed me at gunpoint.
    **Frasier:** Oh yeah, those guys can be pretty rough.
       **Luke:** Oh, you've had experience with pirates?
    **Frasier:** No, I, uh, saw a special once on "60 Minutes."  You know, you 
             should really write down some of these stories.
       **Luke:** Yeah, I've thought about it, but I'm not much of a writer.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't let that stop you.  All you got to do is just get 
             it down on paper, then sort it out later.  You know, I'd be 
             happy to lend a critical eye.
    
    _Roz comes back._
    
       **Luke:** Thanks.  Might take you up on that.
    **Frasier:** OK.
        **Roz:** I have to go, Alice got a bead stuck up her nose.  There's got 
             to be some way to baby-proof her nostrils!  I'm sorry, Luke, 
             we have to go.
    **Frasier:** You know, I-I could drop him off.
        **Roz:** Well, Frasier, that's very nice, but-
       **Luke:** No, no, it's fine.  You go take care of Alice and, uh, I'll 
             hang out with Frasier.
        **Roz:** Yeah well, don't you have to meet Niles?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he's had a tailoring emergency, it could be hours.
        **Roz:** Well, I'll call you tomorrow, Luke.
       **Luke:** OK.
    
    _She bends down and kisses Luke on the cheek._
    
        **Roz:** Bye.
       **Luke:** Bye, Roz.
    
    _She bends down to kiss Frasier._
    
        **Roz:**[_whispering_] He thinks I'm thirty-one and I was in a Whitesnake 
             video.
    
    _Roz kisses Frasier on the cheek and leaves.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Apartment - Kitchen
    Daphne and Martin are in the kitchen, cleaning fish.  Frasier comes in.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hey Dad, welcome home.
     **Martin:** Oh, Fras!  Didn't hear you come in.
    **Frasier:** How was the fishing trip?
     **Martin:** Oh, it was great.  The worst day of fishing beats the best day 
             of working.
    **Frasier:** Well, now that you've proven it, can we take the sign out of 
             the bathroom?
    _They go out into the living room.  As Martin settles into his armchair, 
    Frasier pours himself a sherry._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, uh, Fras, you had a phone call a little while ago.  Some 
             guy by the name of Lou, or maybe-
    **Frasier:** Luke.
     **Martin:** Yeah, Luke, that's it, yeah.  Said he'd call back later.  Real 
             friendly guy, who is he?
    **Frasier:** Roz's new boyfriend.  They're getting quite serious, and 
             actually he and I have hit it off as well.
     **Martin:** Oh, that's great.
    **Frasier:** Actually, it is.  You know, with Niles spending more time with 
             Daphne, I-I don't have anybody to pal around with.  And he's 
             a really interesting guy.  He sails around the world, locating 
             shipwrecks and salvaging treasure.
     **Martin:** Oh!
    **Frasier:** God, you know, he tells some incredible stories!  Yeah, it's 
             refreshing, really - usually I'm the cool friend.
     **Martin:**[_biting his tongue_] Sounds a little free-wheeling for you.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  Well, he's planning to salvage a French trader 
             off the coast of British Columbia next, and he's invited me 
             along.
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier goes to answer it._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, that should be fun.  You need a Dramamine patch just to 
             get into the bathtub.
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Niles, with Eddie on a leash._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello!  Behold, the prodigal pup returns!
     **Martin:** Oh-ho, look who's here!  Come on, boy!
    
    _Niles lets go and Eddie jumps up into Martin's lap._
    
     **Martin:**[_cuddling_] Yeah, there you go, oh yeah.  Thanks for taking  
             care of him while I was gone, Niles.
      **Niles:** You're quite welcome.
     **Martin:** It was very thoughtful of you, unlike some people I know!
    **Frasier:** Dad, it was absolutely essential that I have my floors 
             refinished, thanks to Edward Scissor-Paws there!
    
    _The phone rings.  Niles picks it up and hands it to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh thank you, Niles. [_into phone_] Hello?  Yes, this is Frasier 
             Crane.  What?  I never touched your wife!  Never!  But I've 
             never even heard of... oh Luke, [_laughs_] you got me again!  
             You know, that's six to one!  I did so get one!
    _Frasier goes to his room.  Daphne comes out of the kitchen, still 
    wearing her bloody apron and dishrags._
    
     **Daphne:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hello, my love.
     **Daphne:** Oh I'm sorry, I must look a mess.  I've been cleaning fish all 
             afternoon.
      **Niles:** Oh please, your beauty cannot be obscured by mere entrails, 
             [_looks her over_] or scales, or... is that an eye?
     **Daphne:** I'll go wash up. [_gives him a kiss_]
      **Niles:** If you like.
    
    _As soon as she turns away, he puckers his lips in horror._
    
     **Martin:** Hope Eddie wasn't a lot of trouble.
      **Niles:** Please Dad, he was the perfect houseguest.
     **Martin:** Well, give me the details.  Did he eat?
      **Niles:** Oh, like a horse!
     **Martin:** Slept well?
      **Niles:** Like a log!
     **Martin:** Was he regular?
      **Niles:** We're done here, Dad.
     **Martin:** Just want you to know I really appreciate what you did for me.
      **Niles:** Please, it was my pleasure.  I'm really gonna miss the little 
             guy.  We actually started to bond. 
    
    _He affectionately strokes Eddie's head with a finger._
    
     **Martin:** Ha-ha, that's great.
    
    _Out of his sight, Niles wipes his finger._
    
     **Martin:**[_noticing_] What's this tag?
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, that's nothing.  That's, uh, they put that on at the 
             park.
     **Martin:**[_reading_] "Bark Avenue?"  That's a kennel!  You dumped him off 
             at a kennel?!
      **Niles:** No, no, Dad, actually it's more of a spa than a kennel.
     **Martin:** I trusted you with Eddie and you betrayed that trust!  Why'd 
             you do it, son?
      **Niles:** Well Dad, it took Italian artisans three weeks to stain my 
             Venetian umbrella stand and it took Eddie about twenty seconds!
     **Martin:**[_getting up_] If I wanted him in a kennel I would have put him 
             in one myself!
      **Niles:** Well Dad, uh, I'm sorry.
     **Martin:** Well, so am I.  Come on, Eddie, I'll give you a bath.  
             Who knows what you picked up in that flea trap!
    
    _As he and Eddie leave, the doorbell rings._
    
     **Niles:** Well, it was a lot nicer than that place you made us stay at 
            Yellowstone!
    
    _Frasier opens the door to Roz, looking distraught._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** I need a drink and I need it fast!
    **Frasier:** I'll get the sherry.
        **Roz:** Don't waste your time, I've got grown-up problems!
    _She rushes past him into the kitchen.  When he gets there she is 
    pouring a glass full of expensive scotch._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, the twenty-five year-old Glen Farcas.  Excellent choice, 
             no sense going for the twelve-year old stuff.
        **Roz:** Luke's a slime bag!
    **Frasier:** Oh, what happened?
        **Roz:** I saw him sitting in a cafe with his arms around some blonde.  
             They were all over each other!  I told him off, and we're 
             through.
    **Frasier:** I'm so sorry, Roz. [_hugs her_]
        **Roz:** I really liked him.
    **Frasier:** I know.
        **Roz:** And I thought he liked me.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Gosh, you know, I just got off the phone with him.  He 
             didn't even mention it!  He can't possibly think I'd still be 
             his friend after he treated you this way.
        **Roz:** Well, I'm really glad to hear you say that, Frasier.  I mean, 
             you were my friend first.
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.  Oh come on, [_hugs her again_] I'll get you 
             through this.
        **Roz:**[_sniffles a little_] Thank you, Frasier.  You know what?  I'm 
             feeling better already. [_notices her drink_] Oh, maybe I don't 
             even need this.
    _She throws the scotch into the sink, causing Frasier to gasp.  
    She walks out of the kitchen as he stares, aghast, into the drain.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Boat
    Luke is sitting in the salon of his boat, reading over some notes.  
    Up on the deck, Frasier tries to drop a parcel on the step and leave, 
    but it clatters down the stairs, causing Luke to look up._
    
       **Luke:** Frasier? [_Frasier comes down_] What are you doing?
    **Frasier:** Uh, I was just returning your "Chapman's Nautical Guide" 
             there.  Uh, I-I just wanted to drop it off, actually.
       **Luke:** Without saying hello?
    **Frasier:** Well, I had a talk with Roz.
       **Luke:** Oh, I see.  Well look, if it makes any difference, that woman 
             was an old girlfriend.  She came to town, invited me to lunch, 
             we ordered martinis, and the next thing you know, she was all 
             over me!  You know how it is.
    **Frasier:**[_covering_] Of course, I mean... But Roz is my friend.  
             Take care.
       **Luke:**[_shakes his hand_] You too, Frasier.
    
    _Frasier turns to leave._
    
       **Luke:** By the way-
    **Frasier:** Hmm?
       **Luke:** Thanks for your advice.  I, uh, I started writing down some 
             of those stories.
    **Frasier:** Oh?
       **Luke:** Yeah, I wrote the one about the pirates, and the South 
             American one.
    **Frasier:** Oh great, don't forget the one about the giant squid!
       **Luke:** That was just a joke.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Gosh, you did it again, didn't you?  Oh, you know, 
             I'm gonna miss that.  Ah, see you around.
    
    _He turns to go again, but stops._
    
    **Frasier:** Say Luke, uh, you know, here's a tip: you might try writing 
             in the present tense.  It has a way of giving things a sense 
             of urgency.
       **Luke:** That's great!  I'll try it.
    **Frasier:**[_thoughtful_] Of course, if you hadn't been so thoughtless, 
             we'd be heading for that sushi bar right now and be reviewing 
             those notes.
       **Luke:** Yeah, and that waitress would be there.  I think she likes you.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckles_] Oh, she does not.
       **Luke:** You know what's ironic?  
    **Frasier:** Hmm?
       **Luke:** If I had met you separately from Roz, this wouldn't even be 
             an issue.
    **Frasier:** No, it wouldn't.  You know, the truth is our friendship does 
             exist independently of her.
       **Luke:** That's true.  I mean, if you take Roz out of the equation, 
             does our friendship disappear?
    **Frasier:** It shouldn't.  Of course, for Roz's sake, we'll have to keep 
             this between ourselves.
       **Luke:** No need to rub it in her face.
    **Frasier:** Agreed.  But, uh, for the record, I do not condone your 
             behavior.
       **Luke:** I wouldn't expect you to.
    **Frasier:** I hope they haven't run out of Yellowtail.
    
    _They laugh and head out together.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **A DOUBLE LIFE**
    
    _Scene Four - Apartment
    Frasier and Roz have finished a casual dinner together._
    
        **Roz:** Well, thanks for dragging me out of the house.  It's been a 
             rough week, and it sure helps to have a friend like you.
    **Frasier:** Yeah.  Roz, trust me, you will eventually get over Luke.
        **Roz:** Well, he's not having any trouble getting over me.  I saw him 
             leaving his boat last night with someone.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Did you, uh, get a good look at them?
        **Roz:** Only from behind.  Some fat chick.
    **Frasier:** Fat?  Well, it was kind of cold out last night, there may have 
             been layers involved.
        **Roz:** Yeah, layers of fat. [_checks her watch_] Frasier, it's getting 
             so late, I should go!
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh, right, OK.
        **Roz:**[_getting her things_] Thanks for listening.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course, Roz.
        **Roz:** You ever see me falling for some creep like that again, 
             smack me.
    **Frasier:** Don't give it another thought.  You know, I think he's not 
             worth it, all right?
        **Roz:** Good night.
    **Frasier:** Good night.
    _Roz leaves.  As Daphne comes out to tidy up, Frasier dials the phone._
    **Frasier:** Luke?  It's Fras.  Yeah, uh, listen, I'm free, and I thought 
             maybe I'd swing by.  We can, uh, go over and catch Marsalis 
             at the jazz cafe, because "thar he blows!" [_laughs_] No, no, 
             it just came to me.  All right, Luke, I'll see you soon, bye. 
             [_hangs up_]
     **Daphne:** Some friend you are!  How can you be with that rutting pig 
             after what he did?
    **Frasier:** I don't see what's so wrong about being friends with Roz's 
             ex-boyfriend!
     **Daphne:** Well, if you think there's nothing wrong with it, why are you 
             hiding it from Roz?
    **Frasier:** Well, because I, um, uh- [_Martin comes out_] Dad!  A man has a 
             right to choose his own friends, doesn't he?
     **Martin:** Sure!  'Course, I think you're a rotten Judas for stabbing Roz 
             in the back this way. 
    
    _He goes to the kitchen.  Frasier gets his coat._
    
    **Frasier:** You hear that?  He said "sure!"
    
    _Daphne gives him a look.  He leaves.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Caf e Nervosa
    Frasier is sat at the table by the window, with a small gift box.  Niles comes in._
    
      **Niles:** Guess what I have?  Two tickets to the Orpheus Chamber 
             Orchestra!
    **Frasier:** The Orpheus!  Oh Niles, nobody handles Handel like they handle 
             Handel! [_they laugh_] But wouldn't you rather take Daphne?
      **Niles:** Oh, she wouldn't enjoy it.  I took her to the opera last week.  
             Halfway through _"Das Rheingold"_ she fell asleep.
    **Frasier:** Astonishing!
      **Niles:** Yes, well, it gets worse.  She snorted in her sleep, 
             and startled Wotan, causing him to drop his spear on 
             an unsuspecting gnome.  So, are you free tonight?
    **Frasier:** Gosh Niles, I'm sorry, I've got plans with Luke.
      **Niles:** Oh yes, your much-ballyhooed new best friend.  Is that who 
             the gift is for?
    **Frasier:** Uh, no, no, this is for Roz.
      **Niles:** Oh, a guilt offering!
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose there's some truth to that.  You know, frankly 
             I'm torn.  Part of me thinks I should tell her, but I just 
             know it would devastate her.  She's a broken woman.
    
    _Outside the caf e, it seems Roz has mended, as she is locked in an embrace with Luke._
    
       **Luke:**[_as they break_] I'm glad I bumped into you yesterday.
        **Roz:** And twice this morning.
    
    _They kiss again._
    
       **Luke:** Buy you coffee?
        **Roz:** Sure.
    
    _As they turn to go in, she sees Frasier._
    
        **Roz:**[_gasps_] Oh my God, Frasier's in there!  He can't see us, 
             I don't want him to know we're back together!
       **Luke:** Oh, I don't think he'd really have a problem-
        **Roz:** No, you don't know him.  He's been very supportive, and if he 
             sees us together again, he'll just think I'm weak!  Which I 
             am. 
    
    _She kisses him again.  Inside the caf e:_
    
      **Niles:** Come on, there are no pirates!
    **Frasier:** Sure there are!  Luke was pillaged!
      **Niles:** That is so cool!
    
    _Roz comes in alone._
    
        **Roz:** Hi, guys.
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Roz.
      **Niles:** Hey, Roz.
    **Frasier:**[_she sits down_] I have a little something for you. 
             [_gives her the box_]
        **Roz:** For me?  Oh, what's the occasion?
    **Frasier:** Oh, why do I need an occasion, Roz?  I'm just trying to show 
             a good friend that I'm thinking of her in her time of crisis.
        **Roz:**[_guilty_] Oh, Frasier, I don't deserve your friendship.
    **Frasier:** No, I do not deserve your friendship.
      **Niles:** I deserve my own table, excuse me.
    
    _He goes to the table by the counter._
    
        **Roz:** You know what?  I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.
    **Frasier:** Tonight?
        **Roz:** Yes, you've been so great about this whole Luke thing.  
             I mean, the least I can do is buy you a meal.
    **Frasier:** Well, all right, Roz, I accept. [_takes out his cell phone_] 
             Uh, would you excuse me?
        **Roz:** Sure.
    _Frasier dials his phone and moves over to the counter, behind Niles._
    **Frasier:** Luke-o, F-Man. [_Niles's ears prick up_] Yeah, listen, uh, 
             something's come up tonight and I won't be able to make it, 
             all right?  Great, bye.
    
    _He hangs up and goes back._
    
    **Frasier:** So Roz, where would you like to go tonight?  Chez Henri has 
             the most splendid ox-tail suree-
    
    _Roz's cell phone rings._
    
        **Roz:** Excuse me. [_answers_] Hello?  Oh, hi.  Just a sec. [_to Frasier_] 
             I really need to take this.
    **Frasier:** Of course.
    
    _She takes her phone over to the counter._
    
       **Roz:** Hi, Luke. [_Niles looks up again_] Oh damn, I just made plans...  
            Well, if you put it that way, how can I say no?  I'll see you 
            at eight, OK.
    
    _She hangs up and goes back._
    
        **Roz:** Bad news, Frasier.  My babysitter's all booked up, so can we 
             rearrange dinner?
    **Frasier:** What a shame. [_takes out his phone_] Excuse me.
    
    _He goes his phone to the counter._
    
    **Frasier:** Yeah Luke, it's Fras again.  Listen, um, my plans just got 
             canceled and I was thinking maybe we could... oh, really?  
             Well, that's-that's kind of quick, wasn't it? [_Niles nods to 
             himself_] Well, no problem.  All right, yeah, I'll talk to you 
             tomorrow, bye.
    
    _He goes back.  Roz is opening her gift._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, this is the bracelet I wanted!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I remembered.
        **Roz:** Oh, you're such a good friend.  You're so caring and thoughtful 
             and... loyal.  I got to make a phone call, I'll be right back!
    
    _She goes to the counter.  Niles gets up and heads for the door._
    
        **Roz:** Luke, it's Roz again.  Bad news...
    **Frasier:**[_as Niles goes by_] Oh Niles, listen, as it turns out I am 
             available for that concert tonight-
      **Niles:** No you're not.
    
    _He exits, leaving Frasier confused.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **WITH APOLOGIES TO 
    MR. VONNEGUT**
    
    _Scene Six - Apartment
    Frasier comes out in his jacket.  Daphne is dressed in a somewhat 
    billowing evening dress._
    [_N.B. Here are the first obvious signs of Jane Leeves's pregnancy; 
    she definitely fills out the dress, and her cheeks are glowing._]
    
     **Daphne:** Going out with Luke, I suppose?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I'm having dinner with Roz.  And I will 
             have a clear conscience, because first I am going to stop by 
             Luke's and end our friendship.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I guess our little chat had an impact.
    **Frasier:** So it did.
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
     **Daphne:** Imagine that - me giving advice to a psychiatrist.  Maybe I 
             should be on the radio and you should do the laundry.
    **Frasier:** Yes, what a merry time of misrule that would be.
    _He opens the door to Niles, carrying two parcels: one that's small and 
    daintily wrapped, and one that's large and wrapped in brown paper._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, what are you doing here?
      **Niles:** Well, I'm taking Daphne to the concert.
     **Daphne:** Yes, he said he'd rather go with me than anyone else.
    **Frasier:** Indeed. Well, sweet dreams.
    
    _Frasier leaves._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, sweetie.
      **Niles:** Hello.  This is for you.
    
    _He hands her the smaller parcel - chocolates._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, truffles, [_kisses him_] my favorite!
      **Niles:** Oh, you are so sweet, you say that about everything I bring.
    
    _She sits down and opens the box.  Martin comes out._
    
     **Martin:** Oh Daph, you look great.
     **Daphne:** Thanks.
    
    _Seeing Niles, he turns and walks toward the door._
    
     **Martin:**[_frosty_] Niles.
      **Niles:** Dad, I know you're still peeved about me taking Eddie to the 
             spa-
     **Martin:**[_not stopping_] Kennel.
      **Niles:** Anyway, I-I brought a little peace offering-
     **Martin:** Bribe.
      **Niles:** Dad, it's from Smokey Mountain Farms!
    
    _Martin stops and turns around._
    
      **Niles:** Five different meats in one big box!
     **Martin:**[_disbelieving_] Not the "Slaughterhouse Five."
      **Niles:** They don't make a Slaughterhouse Three.
    
    _Martin delightedly unwraps the large parcel._
    
      **Niles:** Dad, I'm so sorry.
     **Martin:** Oh well, I was disappointed, but-
      **Niles:** I don't want you to think you can't trust me.  I will never 
             let you down again.
     **Martin:** Well thanks, Niles. Listen, I'm taking Eddie out for a walk.  
             Why don't you come along, we can shoot the breeze.
      **Niles:** Oh, uh...
    
    _He looks at Daphne, who is well into the chocolates._
    
     **Daphne:**[_mouth full_] Go on, I need a few more minutes to get ready. 
             [_unwraps another_]
    
      **Niles:** Well, uh, once around the block.
     **Martin:** Come on, Eddie.
     **Daphne:** Take your time!
    
    _They go out into the hall, and Martin calls the elevator._
    
      **Niles:** Dad, thanks for not holding a grudge.  I know how much Eddie 
             means to you.
     **Martin:** Oh, I forgot my jacket.  Here, [_hands Niles the parcel_] hold 
             on to this, put the leash on him and I'll be right back.
      **Niles:** All right, all right.
    _Martin goes back inside.  Niles bends down to attach the leash to 
    Eddie's collar.  The elevator comes, full of people._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, uh, it's all right, I'm waiting for someone.
    _Someone pushes a button.  Just as the elevator doors close, Eddie bolts 
    from Niles's grasp and onto the car.  Niles throws himself against the 
    doors, frantically pushing the button, whispering urgent prayers of 
    "stop!", "come back!", etc.
    
    The doors open again, and someone hands Eddie back to him._
    
      **Niles:**[_breathless_] Thank you, thank you.  It's OK, it's OK...
    _He attaches the leash.  Martin comes back out wearing his jacket._
    
      **Niles:** Come on, slowpoke!
    
    _Martin smiles and follows him.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Boat
    Roz comes down the stairs into the empty salon._
    
        **Roz:** Luke?  Surprise, it's Roz!  Luke?  Luke, are you home?  I got 
             an hour to kill before dinner.
    
    _She looks around, then picks up a pen and starts to write a note, 
    then hears voices from outside._
    
       **Luke:**[_o.s._] Come on board, I'll pour you a drink.
      **Woman:**[_o.s._] You really live here?  I think boats are so sexy.
    _Roz desperately looks around for a place to hide, sees a large closet, 
    flings it open - and shrieks when she sees Frasier standing there._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** What are you doing here?!
    **Frasier:** Well, I stopped by to see Luke, I heard you coming, and I 
             came inside and hid-
       **Luke:**[_o.s._] Watch your step.
    _Roz shushes Frasier and jumps into the closet with him.  As they close 
    the doors, Luke comes in with a blond woman.
    
    Inside the closet, the following is conducted in whispers:_
    
        **Roz:** After everything he did to me, you stayed friends with him, 
             didn't you?!
    **Frasier:** Well, you started seeing him again without telling me!
    _Through the slats in the door, they see Luke put on romantic music and 
    sit down with his date._
    
       **Luke:** You have the most incredible eyes.
        **Roz:** That bastard!  He told me I had the most incredible eyes! 
    **Frasier:** Roz, Roz, we can't let him know we're here!
      **Woman:** What are all these pages?
       **Luke:** Oh, writing a book.  But I'm having a little trouble... 
             maybe you could be my inspiration.
    **Frasier:** That bastard!  He told me I was his inspiration!
        **Roz:** Shh!
    
    _Luke and the Woman embrace in a passionate kiss._
    
    **Frasier:**[_sighs_] We may as well make ourselves comfortable.
    
    _They quietly sit down._
    
        **Roz:** I guess I should have told you we got back together.
    **Frasier:** No, I should apologize, actually.  After the way he treated 
             you, I shouldn't have been hanging around with him.
        **Roz:** You liked him.
    **Frasier:** Truth be told, I don't really make friends very often.  
             In fact, the last true friend I made was you.
        **Roz:** Oh, yuck.
    **Frasier:** Too much?
        **Roz:** No, I'm sitting in something wet.
    **Frasier:** Well, just get up.
        **Roz:** I can't, I'm caught on something.
    **Frasier:** Here, all right, give me your hand.
    _He takes hold of her and yanks her up.  Suddenly there is the hissing 
    of an air pump and something rises into the camera in front of them._
        **Roz:** Uh-oh... 
    _A split-second later the closet bursts open and the inflatable dinghy 
    ejects Frasier and Roz into the salon, surprising Luke and his date._
    **Frasier:**[_taking the offensive_] You've got a lot of explaining to do!
    
    _FADE OUT._
    **Credits:**
    
    Apartment:
    
    Daphne is sitting in Martin's Armchair.  She has polished off the 
    chocolates and is now looking around for something more.  She sees 
    Martin's meat basket next to her, but as soon as she picks it up Eddie 
    jumps up.  She hugs it possessively, but then Martin comes in and 
    snatches it away.  As she grabs for it, he hugs it just as closely._
