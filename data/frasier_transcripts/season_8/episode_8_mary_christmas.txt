    _Act One._
    
    _Scene One - Radio Station.
    KACL is decorated for the Christmas season as "The Dr.  Frasier Crane 
    Show" airs.  Frasier takes a call as Roz sits in her booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, we've got just about a minute before we go to the news.  
             I understand we have Tom from Freemont on line one. [_presses 
             button_] Go ahead, Tom.
        **Tom:**[_v.o._] I don't want to be squeezed into a minute, I will go 
             on after the news.
    
    _Frasier and Roz look surprised._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, why don't you tell me your problem now and then I can 
             give you my reply when we come back.
        **Tom:** No, I'll wait.
    **Frasier:** Very well. [_presses button_] Roz, who else do we have?
        **Roz:** We have Brian on a car phone.
    **Frasier:** Ah! [_presses button_] Go ahead, Brian, I'm listening.
      **Brian:**[_v.o._] For what?  Thirty seconds?!  I'll wait too!
    
    _Frasier and Roz begin to get annoyed._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, then.  I guess I'll just use the time myself.  
             [_presses button and picks up a clipboard, he reads_] "Giddy 
             up, giddy up, let's go" - to the Seattle Christmas Parade 
             this Saturday, broadcast live on Channel 6 TV and hosted by 
             Kelly Kirkland of Channel 6's Kelly and Carol Show.  You know, 
             I must say that Kelly Kirkland is a real treasure.  She's 
             sincere and charming and... well, just about as likeable as 
             sunshine! [_smiles_] We'll be right back. [_presses button_]
    
    _As they go off the air, Roz enters his booth._
    
        **Roz:** Are you okay?
    **Frasier:** Hm? Well, of course, why?
        **Roz:** Oh, I was afraid with all that sucking up you might have 
             burst a lung!
    **Frasier:** That's very funny, Roz.  You see, Kelly's looking for a new 
             co-host for the parade this year and I was hoping it might 
             be me.  You know, I've watched that parade since I was a 
             child and this is my chance to become a part of it.
        **Roz:** Oh, I thought she did that parade with her husband.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I guess you haven't heard.  You see, she's discovered 
             that Carol's been having an affair with her cue card girl.  
             [_laughs_]
        **Roz:** How did she catch him? She find a giant love letter in his 
             pocket?!
    _Frasier laughs.  Mary Thomas then enters the booth, the warm but 
    loquacious woman from last season's "There's Something About Dr.  
    Mary."  She is carrying three books._
    
       **Mary:** Hey, Frasier, guess who?
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Mary Thomas, oh.  Hello, Mary.  Roz, you remember 
             Mary, she and I briefly co-hosted my show last year.
        **Roz:** Of course, I remember.  I listen to your show on KEZW all the 
             time.  
       **Mary:** Oh, well, thank you so much and just for that, here's a copy 
             of my new book and Frasier, here's one for you too.
    
    _Hands them over._
    
        **Roz:**[_reading cover_] "Warm Bread for the Soul" by Dr. Mary!
    **Frasier:** I see you're still identifying yourself as a doctor.
       **Mary:** But now it's true.  You read the inside cover.
    **Frasier:** Eh? [_reads_] Dr. Mary has healed thousands of Seattle radio 
             listeners and is a _summa cum laude_ graduate of the School of 
             Hard Knocks.
       **Mary:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** Mary, I hate to quibble about things like accreditation and 
             such...
    
    _Kenny enters._
    
      **Kenny:** Woh, it's like the American Medical Association in here! 
             [_laughs_] So, isn't this great? Dr.  Mary's coming back to 
             KACL!
        **Roz:** Oh, hey, congratulations!
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, congratulations, indeed.  I... I must have missed 
             that memo! 
      **Kenny:** Yes, she was doing so great in the ratings we had to steal 
             her back.  Now, I thought your doctors took an oath not to 
             hurt anybody, you are killing us!
       **Mary:**[_laughs_] Oh, you.  You give me some sugar!
    
    _Mary hugs Kenny._
    
       **Mary:** Oh, Frasier, I hope you're all right with this.  I know last 
             time you weren't thrilled about us working together.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, this time we'll have separate shows.  It's not like 
             we're going to be sharing a mike! [_to Kenny_] Er, we won't be 
             sharing a mike, will we?
      **Kenny:** Of course not, we're giving Mary the morning drift shift.  
    **Frasier:**[_covering jealousy_] Oh, well, the shift with the biggest 
             audience and the best demographics.  
       **Mary:** Don't you worry, I'll be promoting your show every single 
             day.
      **Kenny:** Is this woman not generous?!  Give me some sugar.
       **Mary:**[_laughs_] No, baby, you've already got yours but here's a 
             book for you. [_hands it over_] And Merry Christmas to all!
      **Kenny:**[_emphatic_] Merry Christmas!
    
    _Mary exits._
    
        **Roz:** What the hell's wrong with you?!
    
    _Kenny looks wistful as Roz exits to her booth.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier seems to have had his way once again this year as his home is 
    aptly decorated in a stylish manner for Christmas.  Frasier answers 
    the door to Niles who is holding a gift._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh.
      **Niles:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** Niles. [_laughs_] I hope you had the presence of mind to bring 
             presents of mine! [_laughs_]  
      **Niles:** I haven't heard that line since last year!
    
    _Niles places the present under the Christmas tree._
    
      **Niles:** But then again, Christmas is the season for chestnuts! 
             [_laughs_]
    
    _Niles notices various bowls of food around the room._
    
      **Niles:** What's all the food for?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, Kelly Kirkland's coming over, I'm trying to 
             make a good impression.  You see, I was doing my best to 
             charm my way into that parade job.
      **Niles:** What is it with you and this parade?
    
    _They sit on the couch._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, don't you remember when we were kids? We'd sit on 
             the couch and cradle our cocoas and stay up late to watch 
             our holiday hosts, Bob Vernon and Sergeant Michelle - the...
       **Both:**...traffic lady!
    
    _Their memories take over._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, I haven't thought about them in years!
    **Frasier:** You know, to me, that was always the official beginning of 
             Christmas and now this is my chance to usher in the season 
             for a whole new generation.
      **Niles:** I loved Sergeant Michelle! To this day, every time I cross 
             against the light, I feel like I'm letting her down!
    
    _Niles smells the air._
    
      **Niles:** All right, what is that fetid smell?
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, that's the food.  I'm preparing dishes that have been 
             featured on Kelly's show.
    
    _The oven pings._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Lord, that'll be my hobo casserole!
      **Niles:** Hobo!  That's the smell!
    _Frasier exits to the kitchen.  Daphne enters from her room and notices 
    Niles._
    [_N.B. Jane Leeves' pregnancy is more covered in this episode, however 
    her eating storyline is still being shown.  Daphne is seen to be eating 
    food whenever she is on screen._]
    
     **Daphne:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_stands and greets her_] Hello, Daphne.
     
    _They kiss._
    
     **Daphne:** So, where are we going for dinner tonight?
      **Niles:** Well, er, it's your pick.  All though, word on the street has 
             it that "Chez Du Mont" has the most delectable Hudson Valley 
             foie gras.  
     **Daphne:** Niles, you're spoiling me!  All this rich food's gonna start 
             catching up with my figure!
      **Niles:** Oh, not you my little hummingbird, never!
    
    _Daphne picks up some food from the dishes and begins to eat._
    
     **Daphne:** You're as sweet as a chocolate souffle.  Let's get some of 
             those, tonight.
    
    _Martin enters from the front door with Eddie._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, that's it!  I know I should have stocked my old Ballantines 
             as soon as they stopped making it.  Now, I can't find a single 
             can.  
    
    _Frasier enters._
    
     **Martin:** Christmas is ruined!
     **Daphne:** Christmas is about more than beer, Mr. Crane!
      **Niles:** Yeah, and this year's extra special because Daphne and I are 
             together.
     **Martin:** Well, that's true. [_thinks_] No more Mel, no Maris, no Lilith...  
             maybe I won't need beer this Christmas!
    
    _Martin exits to his room as the doorbell sounds._
    
    **Frasier:** That's Kelly.  Showtime!
    
    _Niles sticks his thumb up at him as he opens the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Hi, Kelly.
      **Kelly:** Hi, Frasier.
    
    _They hug and kiss a greeting._
    
    **Frasier:** Gosh, you know, I haven't seen you since the "Broadcasters 
             Against Litter" march!
      **Kelly:** I think we really made a difference.
    **Frasier:** Indeed we did.  Now, please, come on in.  I'd like you meet my 
             brother, Niles, and his girlfriend, Daphne.
    
    _They ad-lib hellos._
    
      **Kelly:** Do I smell Hobo Casserole?
      **Niles:** Yes, close your eyes, it's like you're under a railroad bridge!
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Yes, off you go.
    
    _Frasier gives a stern look at Niles and Daphne who abruptly exits to 
    Daphne's room._
    
    **Frasier:** So, you know about Hobo Casserole?
      **Kelly:** Oh, I make it on my show.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I get so many of my recipes from your show that I've 
             forgotten which are mine and which are yours!
      **Kelly:**[_laughs, then sees bowl_] Ah, now don't tell me that's potato 
             chip salad?!
    **Frasier:** Uh-oh, [_obvious acting_] this is embarrassing.
      **Kelly:** So, you really are a fan of the show, huh?
    **Frasier:** Guilty.  I especially admire your work on the Christmas Parade.
      **Kelly:** You really want this, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, Gosh, I do.  I really do.  I must admit.  In fact, you 
             know, I'd be willing to audition for you right now.
      **Kelly:** Oh, Frasier, now that's not necessary.
    **Frasier:** Please, I'd like to.  Now, I've examined the parade schedule 
             and I have taken a liberty of preparing a few ad-libs.  If 
             you would indulge me in one or two?
    
    _Frasier picks up a script as Kelly agrees.  They begin to read:_
    
    **Frasier:** Hey, Kelly.  Have you ever seen eighty beavers march in 
             perfect rhythm?
      **Kelly:** Oh, Frasier, everyone knows beavers can't march.  
    **Frasier:** Oh, they can, when they're the marching beavers of the 
             Riverside High School Band!
      **Kelly:** Hey, you tricked me.
    **Frasier:** Sorry, Kelly, but how about those incredible formations.  
             They're so precise.
      **Kelly:** Well, that doesn't surprise me, Fras, after all, the beaver 
             is nature's first ENGINE-er!  [_laughs_]
    
    _The put the script down._
    
      **Kelly:** That's nice banter.
    
    _Frasier looks gleeful.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Radio Station.
    Frasier is rounding up his show as Roz reads Dr.  Mary's book in her
    booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Seattle, thank you for your calls.  
    _Frasier knocks on the window to Roz who is immersed in the book.  
    She carries on reading._
    
    **Frasier:** Seattle, thank you for your calls!
        **Roz:**[_monotone and bored, still reading_] Hey, Frasier, what are 
             you doing over the Christmas weekend?
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz, if you insist on interrogating me, I'll be co-
             hosting the Seattle Christmas parade tomorrow night...
    _Roz begins nonchalantly ringing some Christmas bells whilst still 
    reading.  She is obviously not too fussed about Frasier's plans for
    finishing the show._
    
    **Frasier:**...on Channel 6 with the lovely and talented Kelly Kirkland.  
             I hope it will be the beginning of a new holiday tradition.  
             Good mental health, see you at the parade.
    
    _Frasier presses the button to go off-air.  Roz quickly throws down 
    her bells and carries on reading.  Kenny enters._
    
      **Kenny:** Hey, doc.  Oh, Frasier, I wish you hadn't done that little 
             promo.
    **Frasier:** Why?  Kelly told me I had the job, her word is good enough 
             for me.
      **Kenny:** I got some bad news.
    **Frasier:** I knew I couldn't trust that woman, and after I had her to 
             my home for that hillbilly buffet!
      **Kenny:** She's got food poisoning.  She'll be laid up for days.
    **Frasier:** Oh, a tough blow!  But, I'm nothing if not a team player, 
             you know, I'll do the parade myself.
      **Kenny:** Boy, you really know how to land on your feet, doc.  But, er, 
             you're still going to have a co-host.  Listen, nothing 
             officially yet, but there are a few names that are floating 
             around.
    
    _Frasier looks behind him and sees Mary jumping about happily with 
    her co-workers.  She then looks at Frasier through the glass and 
    indicates she will be working with him at the parade.  Frasier looks 
    back to Kenny._
    
      **Kenny:** I'll let you know if I hear anything.
    
    _Kenny exits as Frasier grimaces.
    
    End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Martin is on the phone as Frasier enters who puts on his overcoat 
    from the rack._
    
     **Martin:**[_on phone_] Oh, that'd be sweet! [_pause_] No, it's Frasier.  
             Okay, see you, Duke. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, how do I look?
     **Martin:** Well, a smile'd help!
    **Frasier:**[_sighs_] I know, it's just that this whole Mary thing's got me 
             kinda upset.  You know, that woman grew up in Seattle, she's 
             never even seen that parade, it's a sacrilege.  My God, you 
             know, this event, it's an institution, it carries with it a 
             tradition of pride and pageantry and old-fashioned good times. 
             [_thinks_] Well, that's not bad, I think I might open with it.
    
    _Niles and Daphne enter from her room.  Daphne carries a gift and 
    places it under the tree._
    
      **Niles:** Hey, Frasier, good luck tonight.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thanks, Niles.
     **Daphne:** We'll be watching.  Hey, maybe you could say hi to us on the 
             air.
      **Niles:** Oh, for God's sake, Daphne, this is not some sort of a home 
             movie!  This event carries with it a tradition of pride and 
             pageantry and old-fashioned good times. [_thinks_] Eh, now I 
             don't like it!  [_exits_]
    
    _Daphne and Niles stand round Martin and begin their obviously 
    practiced banter._
    
     **Daphne:** Maybe I'll heat up some cider for the parade.
      **Niles:** Oh, sounds good to me.  Dad?
     **Martin:** I guess.  Parade just won't be the same without Ballantine.
      **Niles:** Is anything the same to you without Ballantine?
     **Martin:** Sure, lots of stuff. [_beat_] No, not really.
    _Niles gives Daphne a knowing glance before she quickly exits to the 
    kitchen._
      **Niles:** Dad, I know, Christmas is a few days off but Daphne and I 
             were wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea for you to open 
             one of your presents early.
     **Martin:** No, no, that'd be cheating.  No opening presents till 
             Christmas morning.
    
    _Daphne enters holding a gift-wrapped present, obviously a six-pack 
    of beer._
    
     **Daphne:** Are you sure?
     **Martin:**[_feels at it_] Who-ho-ho!  Well, I guess one wouldn't hurt.  
             I'm not doing this by myself, though.  You two have got to 
             open something too.
      **Niles:**[_to Daphne_] What do you think?
     **Daphne:** One wouldn't hurt.
    
    _The two go to the tree._
    
      **Niles:** This is for you.
     **Daphne:** Oh, and that's yours.
    
    _They takes the presents and go back to sit down._
    
     **Martin:** Everybody got something?
      **Niles:** Yeah.
     **Martin:** All right, good!
    _Martin opens his present and takes out a six-pack of Ballantines._
    
     **Martin:**[_laughs_] I knew it, thank you so much.  How'd you keep it 
             cold?
     **Daphne:** I hid it in the vegetable crisper.  I knew you'd never look 
             there.
    
    _Daphne opens hers and finds some earrings._
    
     **Daphne:** Niles, they're exquisite.  Thank you.
    
    _They kiss._
    
      **Niles:** You're welcome. [_pause_] And you got me... [_unwraps, with 
             enthusiasm_] ...batteries!  Thank you.
     **Daphne:**[_let down_] Oh, you opened the wrong package. [_goes to tree_] 
             You were supposed to open this one.
      **Niles:** No, no, I can't open another one, that's not fair.
     **Martin:** Well, if we all open one more then it'd make it even.
     **Daphne:** Sounds fair.
      **Niles:** Alright, but that's it.
     **Martin:** Yeah, no more.
    
    _They go to the tree as we FADE OUT._
    
    **MARY CHRISTMAS**
    
    _Scene Two - Christmas Parade.
    Frasier and Mary are on air, sat at their podium.  A fanfare of music 
    is heard in the background._
    
    **Frasier:** Merry Christmas, Seattle.  This is Dr.  Frasier Crane...
       **Mary:**...and Dr.  Mary!
    **Frasier:**...Welcoming you to the 42nd annual Christmas parade.
       **Mary:** Yes, first off, we want to wish Kelly Kirkland a speedy 
             recovery.
    **Frasier:** Indeed, and may I say, it's an honor to be sitting here in 
             the very chairs that were once occupied by the legendary Bob 
             Vernon and his co-host Sergeant Michelle, who started this 
             tradition so many years ago.
       **Mary:** And here comes our first float, Frosty the Snowman!
    **Frasier:** You know, Mary, historically speaking the first float was 
             probably the Trojan horse.  It was a gift from the people 
             of Troy.  Once brought inside the city walls however, they 
             discovered it was filled with Greek soldiers, who slaughtered 
             their Trojan enemies in the street.  Of course, modern floats  
             have come a long way since then. [_with a grin_] We hope!
       **Mary:** Well, this float comes to us as a gift from Seattle's sister 
             city: Managua, Nicaragua.  You know, I like the way that 
             sounds. [_with accent_] Managua Nicaragua. [_then_] It sounds 
             like the name of a fine Latino man!
    
    _Frasier looks down at her script, she is obviously ad-libbing._
    
        **Mary:**[_accent_] Would you like to dance, Dr.  Mary? [_then_] Yes, I 
              would, Managua Nicaragua.  Shake that piece of Costa Rica for 
              me! [_laughs_] For more information, here's float reporter 
              Mike.
    **Director:** And we're clear.
    
    _Off air:_
    
        **Mary:** This is fun, isn't this fun?
     **Frasier:** Yes, yes, but you know, Mary, maybe we should try sticking 
              to the script, hmm?  The more we improvise, the less 
              professional we look.
        **Mary:** Oh, okay, I'm sorry now.
    **Director:** Hey, Mary, great ad-libbing.  More of that.  Frasier, try to 
              loosen up.  We're back in five! [_counts down_]
    
    _CUT TO: Later.
    
    We now see Frasier and Mary at the parade on the television at 
    Frasier's apartment._
    
    **Frasier:** Say, Mary, this enormous stocking is overstocked with presents!
       **Mary:** Ooh, I'd like to tear into one of those gifts right now.
    **Frasier:** Well, not until Christmas morning, Mary.  You know, in my 
             house, we don't even shake the boxes.
    
    _The camera pulls back to show the household watching the television 
    in the midst of much wrapping paper and opened presents.  Martin is 
    sat in his fishing gear with an ear-flap hat on.  Daphne is decked out 
    in skiing gear.  Niles is sat wearing his winter clothes reading a 
    book.  They react to Frasier's comments._
    
      **Niles:** We're going to need some wrapping paper.
     **Daphne:** There's a couple of rolls in my room.
     **Martin:** I'll get some tape.
    
    _The three start about the task.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Christmas Parade.
    Frasier and Mary are continuing their "banter."  "We Wish You A Merry 
    Christmas" plays behind them._
    
    **Frasier:** This is the 5th float sponsored by a local software company.
       **Mary:** Hey, those guys on that giant were knocked over by candy cane.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Mary, [_showing her script_] and for a hundred and fifty 
             feet, it certainly is the largest float on the parade.
       **Mary:** Throw some candy canes over here!  [_shouts_] Come on, come on, 
             put some muscle into it, you nerd!
    **Frasier:** Mary...
    
    _Suddenly, a barrage of candy suddenly engulfs Frasier, knocking his 
    headset off._
    
    **Frasier:**[_smiling_] This might be a good time for a break.  We have an 
             exciting surprise coming up - a special mystery guest.  
       **Mary:**[_suddenly, ad-libbed_] It's Santa!
    
    _Frasier carries on smiling, against all odds._
    
     **Frasier:** Thank you, Mary!
    **Director:** And, we're clear!
    
    _Off air:_
    
    **Frasier:** I think I'm gonna go get some air.
       **Mary:** But we're outside.
    **Frasier:** Stretch my legs!
    
    _Frasier goes down from his podium to Roz, who is watching the parade 
    with Alice._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier, thanks for the tickets.  Alice is having a 
             great time.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad somebody is.  Mary is ruining my parade.  Do 
             you know, [_refers to his script_] this has been called "nice 
             banter" by a top parade professional.  Does anybody get to 
             hear it?  No.  Instead, Mary just prattles on endlessly as if 
             every idea that pops into her head is worth saying out loud.  
             She is totally unpredictable.  Now, Santa's coming up and 
             I've prepared a really cute bit and I know she's going to 
             ruin that too!
        **Roz:** Look, if you tell her how important it is, I'm sure she'll 
             back off.  She's a reasonable person.
    
    _The director calls._
    
    **Director:** Fifteen seconds.
         **Roz:** Good luck.
    
    _Frasier goes up to Mary._
    
     **Frasier:** Mary, listen, I've let you have free reign over the parade 
              this evening, could I please do the Santa interview myself?
        **Mary:** Oh, of course, of course.
     **Frasier:** Great.
    **Director:** And cue.
    
    _Frasier walks down to in front of the podium.  On air: "Santa Claus 
    is Coming to Town" plays in the background._
    
    **Frasier:** And we're back.  I see someone special getting off his sleigh.
      **Santa:**[_enters_] Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho. [_to crowd_] Well, hello, up there.
    **Frasier:** Some call him St.  Nick, others Kris Kringle, in Holland 
             he's affectionately known as...
    
    _Santa walks up to Mary._
    
      **Santa:** Oh, you must be Dr.  Mary.  You know, I've been meaning to 
             call your show.  My elves always seem to get a little blue 
             when the work is done, and I thought, well, maybe you could 
             help.
       **Mary:** Oh, Santa.
    **Frasier:** Santa, I've got some questions over here for you.
       **Mary:** Maybe we all could put our heads together and come up with a 
             solution.
      **Santa:**[_to crowd_] Do you think that Dr.  Mary could help Santa to 
             cheer up his elves?  [_they cheer_]
       **Mary:** Why don't you give them some candy?
    
    _The two walk down to Frasier._
    
      **Santa:** That's a great idea.
    **Frasier:** No, that's a terrible idea.  Your elves are probably suffering 
             from seasonal-affective disorder.  Now, loading them up with 
             sweets will only aggravate the problem!
      **Santa:** Kids love candy!  [_the crowd cheers_]
    **Frasier:** Elves are not kids, they're tiny men!
       **Mary:** Well, if you want my opinion...
    **Frasier:** No, thank you, Mary.  We've been listening to your opinions 
             all night, and frankly there isn't enough room left in our 
             heads for another one, now if you would just get back in...
    _Frasier puts his hands out and accidentally punches Santa on the nose 
    with his microphone._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm so sorry.
      **Santa:** What the hell's wrong with you?  Look, I'm bleeding, I'm 
             bleeding.   
    **Frasier:** It was an accident.
      **Santa:** I'm feeling dizzy.
    
    _Santa faints._
    
    **Director:** Cue the tape.  I don't care what tape, find something!
       Woman: What's wrong with you?  You attacked Santa Claus!
     **Frasier:** Look, it was an accident.  Wasn't it, Mary?  You saw it.
        **Mary:** Oh, now, you want my opinion.  Honey, you're on your own.
    
    _We FADE OUT.
    
    Scene Three - Christmas Parade.
    The parade has ended and the place is empty.  Frasier walks up to Mary 
    with a guilty look on his face._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Mary.
       **Mary:** Hello.  Any word on Santa?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he'll be all right.  They gave him a coagulant.  I'd like 
             to apologize for the way I acted toward you.  It was rude and 
             disrespectful.  
       **Mary:** Well, what did I do to make you treat me that way?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just that doing this parade has been a dream of
             mine and it felt like you were taking that away from me.
       **Mary:** Oh, what do you mean?  We're a team.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah.  I was the boring, stiff guy and you were the one 
             everybody loved.
       **Mary:** Oh, come on, now.
    **Frasier:** No, it's true, Mary.  This town has taken you into its heart 
             in a way that they never have with me.  I guess I'm a little 
             jealous of that.
       **Mary:** Oh, Frasier, if it helps, I forgive you and you know something, 
             when you're not trying so hard, you're actually kinda lovable 
             yourself.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Would I be over-stepping my bounds if I were to ask 
             for some sugar right now?
    
    _They hug._
    
       **Mary:** Merry Christmas, Frasier.  
    **Frasier:** Merry Christmas, Mary.
       **Mary:** Well, I'm gonna get on out of here, now.
    **Frasier:** Right, right, you know, I'd offer to walk you to your car 
             but there's still some angry parents in the parking lot!
       **Mary:** Oh, okay.
    **Frasier:** Bye-bye.
    _Mary exits.  Frasier wanders over to the stands and sits.  A man puts 
    his hand down to him, Frasier assumes it is the cleaner.  The man 
    remarks "Excuse me"._
    
    **Frasier:** You just sweep around me.
        **Bob:** Um, no, I want to introduce myself.  I'm Bob Vernon.
    
    _Frasier stands to greet him, over-thrilled._
    
    **Frasier:** What?  Bob Vernon?
        **Bob:** That's right.
    
    _Bob does his signature gesture._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's an honor, sir.
        **Bob:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** Say, you didn't watch the parade this evening did you?
        **Bob:** Well, I turned it off when the smelling salts started making 
             Santa nauseous.  You know, Frasier, I got off to a rather 
             rough start at this parade myself.
    **Frasier:** You did?
        **Bob:** Hm.  Oh yes.  Sergeant Michelle and I had absolutely no 
             rapport that first year.
    **Frasier:**[_surprised_] No?!
        **Bob:** Frankly she got on my nerves.  You know, she wasn't a real 
             sergeant.
    **Frasier:**[_shocked_] No?!
        **Bob:** Listen, son, try to lighten up on yourself.  You did some 
             real nice work down here today.
    **Frasier:** Thanks.
        **Bob:** Good luck.
    
    _Bob starts to leave._
    
    **Frasier:** Say, Mr. Vernon?
        **Bob:** Yes?
    **Frasier:** Is there any chance that you'd like to join me in a little 
             banter?
        **Bob:** It would be an honor.
    
    _They sit on the steps as Frasier opens his script.  Bob puts on his 
    reading glasses._
    
    **Frasier:** Right here: [_reads_] Say, Bob.  Have you ever seen eighty 
             beavers march in perfect rhythm?
        **Bob:** Frasier, everyone knows beavers can't march.  
    **Frasier:** They can, when they're the marching beavers of the riverside 
             high school band!
        **Bob:** Oh, you tricked me.
    **Frasier:** Sorry, Bob, but how about those incredible...
    
    _They carrying on bantering as Frasier fulfills his childhood dreams.
    
    End of Act Two._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    It is Christmas Day and the time has come to open up the presents 
    under the tree.  Daphne, Niles and Martin all have to fake surprise in 
    front of Frasier as they re-open their gifts.  Frasier opens a gift 
    and finds Martin's fishing cap in there.  It seems they put it back in 
    the wrong box.  Frasier is at first taken aback at this weird choice 
    for him but still puts it on.  The gang plays along as Niles points 
    out to him under closed teeth that it suits him.  Martin, however, 
    kicks the gift box in frustration at not receiving the hat which he 
    had been looking forward to.
