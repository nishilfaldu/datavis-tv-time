    **Skyline:** The light atop the space needle flashes.
    
    _ACT 1
    
    Scene 1 -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Roz and Frasier are seated.  Kenny brings them coffee.
    _
        **Roz:** Oh, thank you for the coffee, Kenny.
      **Kenny:** Oh, you don't have to thank me.  We're not keeping score.      
             Life's too short to keep track of who owes who for this or         
             that or whatnot.  Let's just enjoy ourselves.
    **Frasier:** Whatever you want, Kenny, the answer is no.
      **Kenny:**[_caught_] Just hear me out.  Look, I need a favor but before
             I tell you what it is, I want you to look at this. 
    _He hands Frasier a stack of papers.  Frasier looks at it._
    **Frasier:** "KACL Psychographics."
      **Kenny:** We hired a firm to sift through the program data and give us
             a kind of profile on each show's average listener.
    **Frasier:** All right, let's see. [_reading_] Gil's average listener is a 
             woman, mid-30's, well-educated, hmmm...  What about my average
             listener.  Who is she?
      **Kenny:**[_taking the papers_] Well, actually, uh, she's an older  
             gentleman... [_Frasier reacts unhappily_] who likes to keep the
             radio on for company.
        **Roz:** Ouch.
    **Frasier:** Oh, and Roz, it seems a number of listeners think you're a man.
        **Roz:** What?!
    **Frasier:**[_indicating the data_] I'm sorry the-the station spent its 
             money on this nonsense, but this research is patently absurd.
      **Kenny:** Regardless, you could really stand to increase your audience
             in the youth market.
    **Frasier:** Well, I thought we upped the advertising budget for that very
             reason.
      **Kenny:** I did, but I need some help.  How would you like to be a guest
             on _Teen Scene_?
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Kenny.  I've done that show before, I'm not doing
             it again.
      **Kenny:** Doc, you could use younger listeners.  You've seen the
             research.
    **Frasier:** My show is fine.  That so-called _research_ is nothing
             but a bunch of... confounded correlations and mediocre
             deductions.
    _A Caf e guest, Lucy, approaches the table.
    _
       **Lucy:** Excuse me, are you Dr. Frasier Crane?
    **Frasier:** Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
       **Lucy:** Can I get your autograph?
    **Frasier:** What's your name?
       **Lucy:** Lucy.  But make it out to Paul.  I volunteer at his hospice,
             and I think you're just about the only friend he has left
             anymore.
    _Kenny stares at Frasier as he begins to write the autograph._
    **Frasier:**[_to Kenny_] Fine, I'll meet the kids.
    _FADE OUT_
    **NILES GETS HIS DAILY DOSE OF SPINACH**
    _Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment.
    Niles and Daphne are seated on the couch._
      **Niles:** I have a little something for you. 
    _He hands Daphne a jewelry box._
     **Daphne:** Ohh... Earrings.  They're beautiful.
      **Niles:** Try them on.  I've disinfected them with peroxide.
     **Daphne:** Niles, it's a lovely thought, but you kind of gave me the
             exact same pair last summer.
      **Niles:** No, I did not.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, take a look. 
    _She pulls back her hair to reveal the earrings._
      **Niles:** I am _so_ sorry.
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't be silly.  It was bound to happen sometime after all
             the nice presents you give me.  I'll just have to get pierced
             somewhere else.
      **Niles:** Still, I... 
    _He reacts to what she has just said with shock and then a cheesy smile. 
    Somewhat taken aback, he then mouths "What?"  Daphne grins.
    
    Martin enters in his robe._
     **Daphne:** Well, well, look who's up.  How was your company party, 
             Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** Fine.
      **Niles:** Sounds like it was more than just fine if you're getting up
             this late.
     **Daphne:** He came in late, too.
     **Martin:**[_sitting at the table_] Didn't know there was a curfew.
     **Daphne:**[_rising, moving toward him_] Oh my God!  Is that lipstick
             on your chin?  It is!
     **Martin:** I got kissed, okay?  Big whoop. 
    _Niles moves to join them.  Martin wipes his chin._
     **Martin:** There's no lipstick on my chin.
     **Daphne:** Busted!
    _Niles and Daphne break out in laughter and sit down at the table._
      **Niles:** Well, so what's her name?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, when can we meet her?
     **Martin:** Her name's Peg, and nobody's meeting anyone.  It was just a
             little fooling around, that's all.
    _Daphne looks at Niles, incredulous._
      **Niles:** Well, are you going to see her again?
     **Martin:** No, and if she calls I'm not here, got it?  I don't want to
             encourage her.
     **Daphne:** Well, why not?  It sounds like you had fun.
     **Martin:** See, this is exactly the conversation I'm trying to avoid with
             Peg.  You kiss a girl, and suddenly she wants to know "What 
             does it mean?" and "When can I see you again?" "Why don't you
             call me?"
     **Daphne:**[_disdainfully_] That's a wonderful attitude.
     **Martin:** Hey, it was great and I loved it, but I don't want to ruin it
             by making it more than it was.  Women never let you have a
             bite of ham.  They always make you sit down for spinach.
    _Niles and Daphne ponder his point.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 3 -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier and Roz are seated.  Kirby walks in and approaches them.
    _
      **Kirby:** Whoa!  This is embarrassing, huh?  All three of us going to
             the same place when we're skipping out on work.
    **Frasier:** We are not skipping out on work.
      **Kirby:** Right, we're all at the doctor's. [_chuckles "knowingly"_]
    **Frasier:** Kirby, we don't work the same hours that you do.  We're done
             for the day.
      **Kirby:** Oh, yeah, that's good.  It's better if we don't all use the
             same excuse. [_He sits._]
    **Frasier:** Kirby, I think it's time for you to straighten up.  You show
             up late every day.  You are inattentive, and you have a bad
             attitude.  How do you expect to thrive in this job or any
             other job?  I am this close to giving you a lecture!
    _Kenny enters._
      **Kenny:** Hey, guys.  Uh, Doc, you got a minute?  There's someone I want
             you to meet.
    _We see Emily seated in the corner.  She is well-dressed, sitting up
    straight, looking the typical high school honor student._
      **Kirby:** Oh, dude, that's Emily Crowther - one of the nimrods from 
             _Teen Scene._  You're not going to do that show, are you?
             Those guys go to my old high school.  A bunch of losers. 
    _He makes a rude gesture on the last word._
      **Kenny:** For your information, Kirb... Hey, I thought you were at the
             doctor.
      **Kirby:** I was.  Uh, he says everything is fine.  He also said I
             probably shouldn't come in tomorrow until about 11:30.
      **Kenny:** How dumb do you think I am?  You will show up first thing
             tomorrow morning - after your "Meals on Wheels" delivery.
    _Roz and Frasier exchange a look at this._
      **Kirby:** You got it. 
    _He rises and leaves._
    **Frasier:**[_rising_] Listen, Kenny, I'm actually just on my way out.   
             Perhaps I could meet this young lady tomorrow at the station?
      **Kenny:** Oh, come on.  Say hi to the kid.  She's a big fan.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, gosh, I would hate to appear standoffish.
             After all, the young lady has built up a certain image of me
             in her mind, and that shouldn't be crushed certainly. [_He puts
             on his coat._]
        **Roz:** Do we have to go through this _every_ time?  Go over there! 
    _She gestures for them to leave, twice.  Frasier and Kenny walk to the 
    corner where Emily is seated.  Emily rises._
      **Kenny:** Emily Crowther.  Dr. Frasier Crane.
    _Emily is grinning widely and reaches to shake his hand._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Emily.
      **Emily:** Pleased to meet you, Dr. Crane!  I look forward to having you
             on our show!
    **Frasier:** Well, technically, I haven't agreed to do it yet.  You see, I
             had a rather bad experience on _Teen Scene_ the last time.
      **Emily:**[_exuberant_] Are you familiar with the new _Teen Scene_?
    **Frasier:** Well, uh, no, actually I'm not.
      **Emily:**[_jumping in excitedly_] Well then you don't know that we do hard-
             hitting journalism with a youthful bent! [_slipping into obvious
             flattery_] Of course, it's not _nearly_ as distinguished as 
             your show, which I adore. 
    _Her nose is quite brown at this point -- and Frasier laps it up.
    _
    **Frasier:** Really.
      **Kenny:** Big fan!
      **Emily:** Dr. Crane, may I be frank?  Having you on our show would be, 
             In your own words, "a great boon" to us.
    **Frasier:** A boon. 
    _He smiles warmly.  This clinches it for him._
    **Frasier:** Do you really think so?
      **Kenny:** Oh, major boon.
    **Frasier:** Well, then, consider it granted.  I'm sure we'll have a 
             splendid time. 
    _Emily squeals in delight and grins widely.  They shake hands._
    **Frasier:** Who knows, I may even learn something from you.
      **Emily:** Oh, you flatter me, Dr. Crane.
    _Frasier moves to exit.  Niles is entering._
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Ah, Niles.
      **Niles:** Who's manning the Pasquini?
    **Frasier:** Jimmy Ray! [_he exits_]
      **Niles:** Capital. [_he takes off his coat and moves to the counter_]
             Cappuccino, please.  Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey, Niles.  What are you doing here?  Shouldn't you be out
             buying Daphne another pair of earrings?
      **Niles:** Oh... please, don't make me feel any worse.
        **Roz:** Actually, I thought it was sweet.
      **Niles:** Well, I feel just awful.
        **Roz:** You want to know what I would do?
      **Niles:**[_hesitating_] Oh, what the hell? [_He sits._]
        **Roz:** First of all, enough with the earrings.  Everything doesn't
             have to be so fancy.  Don't get me wrong.  Jewelry is terrific,
             but sometimes a woman likes to know that you're paying
             attention.  Mix it up a little.  Do something crazy - I mean 
             totally out there.
      **Niles:** Are you talking about scarves? [_The waiter hands him his cup._]
             Thank you.
        **Roz:**[_regrouping after Niles's question_] OK, let me give you an
             example.  When I was 20, my boyfriend stole a "Doyle's Pub"
             sign for me.  We were drunk and we saw it, and he said "Hey,
             that's your name on that sign.  You should have it."  It was
             spontaneous, and a little dangerous... and very romantic!
      **Niles:**[_thoughtful, the wheels turning_] Spontaneous and dangerous...
             Thanks, Roz.  You've given me something to mull over during my
             herbal wrap. 
    _He sips his coffee thoughtfully.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 4 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin enters.  Daphne is carrying a food tray to the table._
     **Daphne:** Oh, good.  I thought you were going to miss Dr. Crane on the 
             radio.
     **Martin:** How many times a day is that guy on?
     **Daphne:** It's not his show, it's _Teen Scene_.
     **Martin:** Oh, I don't have time for that teenage crap. [_taking off his
             coat_] Did I get a call from a girl today?
     **Daphne:**[_carrying the tray to the coffee table_] You mean Peg?
     **Martin:** Or any girl.  Or Peg. [_fishing_] Did Peg call?
     **Daphne:** No.  It's been a few days, hasn't it?
     **Martin:** I really thought she'd try to spring that relationship stuff
             on me.  Well, I guess I misjudged her. [_He sits in his chair._]
     **Daphne:** Unless she didn't like her free sample.
     **Martin:**[_grinning and chuckling_] I think we can rule that out.  When
             a lady gets the full Marty Crane treatment, she doesn't forget
             it.
     **Daphne:**[_coyly_] And Peg got the Full Marty?
     **Martin:** I never give anything less.  So, yeah, I guess I am a little 
             surprised she hasn't called.  I mean, mostly relieved, of 
             course, but... also surprised.
     **Daphne:** Don't feel bad.  Maybe you had an off night.
     **Martin:**[_snorting sarcastically_] Anything's possible, I suppose.
    _The phone rings.  Daphne slowly moves to answer it, making Martin 
    squirm.  She picks it up on the third ring._
     **Daphne:** Hello? [_excitedly_] Well, yes he is! One moment please. 
    _She mouths "It's a woman" and smiles broadly, handing Martin the phone._
     **Martin:**[_imitating Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman")_] Hola! [_Daphne 
             rolls her eyes._] Uh-huh.   Oh, I think that would be fine.
             Thursday at 9:00?  See you then. 
    _He hangs up._
     **Daphne:** Well... look who's suddenly in a relationship!
     **Martin:** Shows you what you know.  That was the dentist.
     **Daphne:** Thank goodness, right?
     **Martin:** Right!
    _Daphne nods sarcastically behind his back and heads for the kitchen.
    Martin stares forlornly at the phone.  FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT 1
    
    ACT 2
    
    Scene 5 - Radio Station.
    Frasier is standing in the hall outside the studio talking to Emily,
    who is standing primly, with a very officious attitude._
      **Emily:** I agree with you, sir.  The difference between valedictorian
             and salutatorian is largely arbitrary.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Emily.  I didn't mean to go on like that, but...
             the wound is still raw.
    _Kirby approaches, carrying a stack of boxes._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Kirby.
      **Kirby:**[_icily_] Hello _Emily_.  How's Honors everything?
      **Emily:** Splendid, thank you. [_disdainfully_] How's carrying a bunch of
             boxes around a radio station?
      **Kirby:** Good.
    **Frasier:** You know, Emily, I was thinking that perhaps after the show I
             could invite you and your friends to a... a cheeseburger or
             some such.
      **Emily:** Oh, we'd like that very much. [_Her grin is cheesier than the
             proposed burger._] Can I get you a coffee?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  Thank you, Emily.  You know I asked for one a little
             while ago, but it never showed up. 
    _He glares at Kirby.  Emily departs on the errand._
      **Kirby:**[_shouting down the hall at Emily, dodging Frasier's anger_] Now
             who's carrying a bunch of stuff around a radio station?
    _Frasier groans at Kirby.  
    
    CUT TO: the interior of the studio.  A man is seated at Frasier's usual 
    console.  He is smoking heavily, and his hair and clothes are very 
    unkempt.  Frasier enters._
       **Andy:** Hi, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh.
       **Andy:** Andy McNiff. [_They shake hands._]
    **Frasier:** Andy.
       **Andy:** I'm the moderator.  I'm really glad you could make it.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well... likewise, I look forward to some intergenerational
             byplay. 
    _He sits in the "guest" chair._
    **Frasier:** Uh, by the way, Andy, are you going to be smoking all night?
       **Andy:**[_looking at his pack, which is apparently full_] Yeah. 
             [_Frasier's displeasure shows._] Look, no matter what happens, 
             I'm on your side.
    **Frasier:**[_confused_] Thank you.  What does that mean exactly?
       **Andy:** Well, uh... 
    _He is interrupted by the appearance of Emily and two male friends who 
    enter from the booth._
       **Andy:** Hi, guys!  Your guest has arrived.
      **Emily:**[_handing Frasier a mug_] Here's your coffee, Dr. Crane.  These
             are my colleagues, Ryan and Trent.
    **Frasier:** Trent. [_They shake hands._]
      **Trent:** Pleased to meet you, sir.  We're very excited.
    **Frasier:** Likewise.  Hello, Ryan. 
    _He shakes Ryan's hand.  Ryan and Trent also look the role of the honor 
    student, both wearing Dockers and collared shirts._
       **Andy:**[_on a signal from a producer in the booth_] Ten seconds, guys.
             [_He puts on headphones._]
    **Frasier:**[_somewhat nervous_] Ah, right. [_He sits back down._] You know,
             you may be surprised to learn that it was not so very many 
             years ago when I myself occupied those tough years 'twixt 
             12 and 20. 
    _He puts on headphones, as do the three youths.  They take their places 
    on stools in front of microphones behind Andy, looking like the stunt 
    double line-up for a movie starring Ryan Phillipe, Reese Witherspoon,
    and Freddie Prinze, Jr.
    
    Andy opens the show._
       **Andy:** Hi, and welcome to _Teen Scene_ , Seattle's premier talk show for 
             young people.  I'm Andy McNiff, and for the next 60 minutes 
             we'll be engaged in some straight talk with our special guest. 
             [_Frasier grins._] And here to get things rolling is our _Teen 
             Scene_ panel: Trent, Ryan, and Emily.  Trent?
      **Trent:** Tonight, we're talking to Dr. Frasier Crane, a man who knows 
             what makes us tick.  But what do we know about him? 
    _Frasier reacts with surprise at this comment._
      **Emily:** Dr. Crane, you're a popular psychiatrist and radio personality.
             What would you say is the secret of your success?
    **Frasier:** I suppose it has something to do with the fact that I am a 
             good listener and have a friendly voice, and I also try to 
             pass along some real psychological insight and advice.
      **Emily:**[_glancing at her notes_] My research shows that your replies 
             Are typically less than five minutes long.  Doesn't seem like 
             a lot of time for substantive psychological advice.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well if I believe there's a real problem than I usually
             refer the caller...
      **Emily:**[_interrupting him with an evil grin_] So if it's a real problem
             than you pass the buck.
    _Frasier, dumbfounded, looks and mouths words at Andy, who seems 
    disinterested and looks away._
    **Frasier:** Excuse me?!
       **Ryan:** February 9, 1993.  Does that date mean anything to you?
    **Frasier:** Should it?
       **Ryan:** According to the _Boston Globe_ you spent two hours on a ledge 
             threatening to jump if your wife left you. 
    _Frasier now realizes he has been rail-roaded._
       **Ryan:** How many of your listeners are aware that they're taking 
             advice from a man who was nearly a stain on the sidewalk?

    _Andy does not intervene, but taps the spent end of his cigarette into
    the ashtray, seeming somewhat oblivious._
    **Frasier:** Andy, isn't it about time for a commercial break?
       **Andy:** Actually, this show is a public service, therefore commercial-
             free. 
    _He shrugs and mouths "Sorry" at Frasier._
    **Frasier:**[_resigned_] Splendid.
    _FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 6 - A residential street, presumably in suburban Seattle.
    
    Niles is walking Eddie down the street.  He is dressed in black from
    head to toe, including a trench coat.  He passes a street lamp.
    A pause.  He moves with stealth back to the lamp, with Eddie in tow.
    
    The camera reveals the top of the lamp, which also serves as the
    corner street indicator.  The two signs read "Maple Street 1700," and,
    far more significantly, "Daphne Lane 200."  Niles looks around nervously.
    
    Eddie barks.  Niles whistles.  Eddie lifts his leg and appears to do
    his business on the lamp pole.  They are briefly illuminated by the 
    headlights of a passing vehicle.  
    
    Niles whistles at Eddie again, and he lowers his leg.  He gives Eddie 
    a treat and walks with him to the hedge behind the sidewalk.  Niles 
    pulls a folding stepladder from behind the hedge.  He stands it next 
    to the pole.  He then flips back his coat to reveal a tool belt, from 
    which he takes a wrench.  
    
    (Who does he think he is, Batman?  And any seasoned burglar would have 
    told him to go motorized, sacrificing silence for speed. - Mike Lee)
    
    Looking up at the sign, he places the wrench in his mouth and begins 
    to climb the ladder, but is interrupted by Eddie barking at something.  
    He climbs back down, hurriedly sticks the ladder back behind the hedge,
    removes the wrench from his mouth, and moves Eddie back to the pole, 
    whistling again.  Eddie repeats the leg-lifting routine.  A couple of 
    pedestrians walk past, and Niles nervously waves and says "Hi" to them 
    as they go by.  
    
    He whistles at Eddie again, who lowers his leg.  He gives him another 
    treat, retrieves the ladder again, and again places it next to the
    pole.  He climbs the ladder and places his hands on top of the
    "Daphne Lane" sign.  Nervously, he begins to use the wrench to 
    undo the bolts attaching the sign to the pole.  As he does so,
    he loses his balance.  Struggling to regain it, he inadvertently
    kicks the ladder away, so that it is no longer under his feet.
    He is left hanging from the sign.  Eddie barks repeatedly.
    
    Niles is then literally "caught in the headlights" as we hear a
    car pull up.  The sound of a siren reveals the nature of the car.
    He stares mortified into the lights, still hanging from the sign.
    Eddie continues to bark.  
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 7 - The lobby of the office building where Martin works as
    a security guard.
    
    A woman in uniform is seated behind the desk, reading a book.
    Martin enters from the elevator._
     **Martin:** Well, hi, Peg!  Geez, I didn't know you were working the
             graveyard tonight.
        **Peg:** All this month.  What brings you here?
     **Martin:** Actually, I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to make
             sure they'd fixed that elevator camera.  But see, I thought
             Rich was on tonight, which explains why I didn't know you'd
             be here. [_He grins nervously._]
        **Peg:** Right. Well, it's... fixed.
     **Martin:** Well, that's good. 
    _There is an awkward pause.  Martin remains standing at the desk while 
    Peg goes back to her book._
     **Martin:** Somebody broke it. 
    _Peg glances briefly at him, then back to her book._
     **Martin:** Okay, then.
        **Peg:** See ya later.
     **Martin:** See ya. 
    _He heads back to the elevator.  Rethinking, he turns back around._
     **Martin:** Hey, how come I never heard from you?
        **Peg:**[_flustered_] Oh, geez!
     **Martin:** Well, I was under the impression we had some chemistry going.
             I think I deserved at least a phone call.
        **Peg:** Hey, we made out a little.  Let's not ruin it by making it
             more than it was.
     **Martin:** Just what I was thinking.
        **Peg:** Good.  Then it won't be awkward or anything if we pull the
             same shift, right?
     **Martin:**[_with feigned indifference_] What are you talking about?
             Don't worry about me.  Watch yourself. 
    _He laughs weakly.  She joins in the laughter._
        **Peg:** Okay.  No worries. [_They shake hands._] So I'll see you around
             then.
     **Martin:** Yeah, see ya.
        **Peg:** Hey! You going to Jerry's retirement party?
     **Martin:** I might drop in for a pop or two.
        **Peg:** Yeah, same.  Maybe I'll see you there.
     **Martin:** Yeah.  Maybe you will.
    _Martin takes this as an affirmation, which boosts his confidence.
    He resumes the "Full Marty" demeanor as he struts to the elevator.
    FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 8 - Radio Station.
    Frasier's appearance on "Teen Scene" continued.  Things have 
    obviously degenerated even further._
    **Frasier:** Again, I freely admit that I assisted my ex-wife in 
             psychological experiments on lab animals.  However, 
             at that time, putting a pair of sunglasses on a monkey 
             did not constitute cruelty! 
    _His gestures and expressions during this speech indicate that his level 
    of exasperation has increased considerably._
      **Emily:**[_smugly, confrontational_] We'll just agree to disagree.
    **Frasier:** You know I scarcely see how this line of questioning about my
             personal life can benefit your listeners!
      **Emily:** Well, Dr. Crane.  Every day you ask your listeners to blindly
             trust you.  Isn't the public entitled to know a little bit 
             more about that "friendly voice" that seems to know all the 
             answers?
    **Frasier:** Oh... I understand.  This isn't about me at all.  You see, 
             Your combative line of questioning is completely age-
             appropriate.  The challenging of authority, the zeal for 
             truth...
       **Ryan:** Speaking of truth, I have a few questions about your last tax
             return... [_of which he has a copy, rifling through it_]
       **Andy:** I hate to interrupt, panel, but it's time for our regular news
             break.  We'll be back with more _Teen Scene_ fun after this.
    _They remove their headphones.  Frasier is shell-shocked.  Kirby sticks 
    His head in the door._
      **Kirby:** Dr. Crane, can I borrow you for a second?
    _Frasier moves quickly to escape._
      **Emily:**[_with the old grin_] You're doing great!
    _Frasier glares murderously at her as he exits the studio.  He joins
    Kirby in the hall._
      **Kirby:** Dude, you're in trouble here.
    **Frasier:** Thanks for the update!
      **Kirby:** Take it easy, Mr. Snappy.  I'm here to help you.
    _Kirby shows him a notebook.  
    
    CUT BACK to the studio:_
      **Trent:** Can you believe that Kirby guy works here?
      **Emily:** I can't believe they finally graduated him.
       **Andy:** Now, remember, guys, you're still goodwill ambassadors...
      **Emily:**[_cutting him off disdainfully_] We weren't talking to you.
       **Andy:**[_giving up, taking another drag_] Oh-kay.
    _Frasier re-enters, looking much happier.  He is carrying Kirby's 
    notebook._
      **Trent:** Everything okay, Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** Absolutely.  I didn't fully appreciate the hard-hitting nature
             or your journalism, but I... I think I know how to handle it
             now. 
       **Andy:** We're back with more _Teen Scene_ and our special guest, Dr.
             Frasier Crane. 
    _They place their headphones back on._
      **Trent:** Now, Dr. Crane, where were we?
    **Frasier:** I believe we were discussing my competence as a mental health
             professional.  And though it is true that I have suffered
             several emotional setbacks in my life, if we are to be 
             honest... haven't we all?
      **Trent:** And that's your defense... that we all have problems. 
    _All three chuckle disdainfully.  Frasier flips to a page of the notepad._
    **Frasier:** Perhaps I can better illustrate my point by reading from a 
             Poem entitled, "An Onion for Trisha."
      **Trent:**[_taken aback_] Where did you get that?
    **Frasier:**[_reading_] "My heart is like an onion, filled with layers of 
             tears.  Why, oh, why did you leave me, Trisha?"
      **Trent:** Okay, give me that. 
    _He reaches, but Frasier successfully pulls it away from his grasp._
      **Emily:**[_clearly upset_] Trisha _Sharpe_?  You said you never liked her!
    **Frasier:**[_gleefully_] Ooh, Trent, tough blow!  Yes, it seems that 
             youthful relationships are _fraught_ with emotional hazards.
             Especially in the case of a -- [_flips to another page_] a young 
             woman who finds her first love at Math Camp. 
    _He sneers maliciously at Emily.  Trent rounds on her._
      **Trent:** What happened at Math Camp?!
      **Emily:**[_highly distressed_] I don't want to talk about it!
       **Ryan:**[_trying to save the situation_] Uh, Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Yes, Ryan. [_leafing through the notebook_] Or as the boys on 
             the swim team call you...
       **Ryan:**[_cutting in desperately_] So, do you have any good advice for 
             kids that want to go to college?
    _Frasier smiles with deep satisfaction and closes the notebook._
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I believe I do.
    _DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene 9 - Time fade to the end of the show.  
    Frasier has taken over the show.  His three interrogators are slumped
    on their stools, looking depressed and defeated._
    **Frasier:** In short, caller, there is nothing wrong with you, and you're 
             not going to get sick.  But remember, the more frequently you 
             do it, the less special it becomes. 
    _The "panel" appears deeply disturbed by the subject matter._
    **Frasier:** I hope that answers your question.
       **Mike:**[_v.o._] Uh, yeah.  Well, uh, thanks a lot.
       **Andy:** Well, that about wraps it up for tonight's _Teen Scene._  For 
             Trent, Ryan, and Emily, this is Andy McNiff - reminding you 
             we're still taking applications for the moderator's job - and 
             wishing you a teen-tastic week.  Good night!
    _They go off the air.  The three teens quickly grab their notes and 
    head for the door._
    **Frasier:** Thanks, kids, I had fun!
      **Trent:**[_icily_] Yeah, thanks.
    _They leave, slamming the door.  Andy rises, grabbing his pack of smokes._
       **Andy:** Thank you.  You made my month.
    _Frasier chuckles and shakes Andy's hand heartily.  Frasier exits the 
    studio, where Kirby is waiting in the hall._
      **Kirby:** Way to go, Dr. Crane, that was sweet! 
    _They slap hands and join in a typical post-high five handshake._
    **Frasier:** I'm not exactly proud of myself, Kirby.
      **Kirby:** Oh, you should be, man, those dinks brought it on themselves.  
             They were, like, "We're gonna get this old dude!" and then you 
             were, like, "Old dude!  Say what?" and then they were like 
             "Wham bam!... [_he descends into gibberish imitations of their 
             arguing._] It was awesome.
    **Frasier:** Well said, Kirby.  And thank you for helping me out.  By the 
             way, how did you dig up all that stuff?
      **Kirby:** Uh, let's just say I've got a few operatives who were, uh, 
             Held back.
    **Frasier:** Ah.
    _They begin to walk down the hall._
      **Kirby:** Hey, you know, why don't you and I continue this conversation 
             over a... a cheeseburger or some such.
    **Frasier:** I'd like that very much.
    _They put their arms around each other as they walk down the hall.  
    And we:  
    
    FADE OUT
    
    END OF ACT 2_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles and Daphne are seated on the couch in Frasier's apartment.  
    Daphne is opening a gift box.  Niles, still clothed in the black getup 
    from his criminal escapade and still with Eddie in tow, looks nervous 
    as she looks at the gift.  
    
    When she sees what it is, she gets a loving expression on her face 
    and mouths "Oh..." She pulls a framed picture out of the box, and looks 
    delighted as she continues to look at it.  We see only the back of the frame.
    
    She stands the picture up on the coffee table.  Niles is pleased that 
    she likes it.  She kisses him on the cheek and they embrace, with Eddie 
    between them.  
    
    The camera then pans to reveal the picture.  It is the set of Niles's
    mug shots, one profile and one frontal, complete with the name plate.
