He is dressed in black from head to toe, including a trench coat.  He passes a street lamp. A pause.  He moves with stealth back to the lamp, with Eddie in tow.  The camera reveals the top of the lamp, which also serves as the corner street indicator.  The two signs read \"Maple Street 1700,\" and, far more significantly, \"Daphne Lane 200.\"  Niles looks around nervously.  Eddie barks.  Niles whistles.  Eddie lifts his leg and appears to do his business on the lamp pole.  They are briefly illuminated by the headlights of a passing vehicle.  Niles whistles at Eddie again, and he lowers his leg.  He gives Eddie a treat and walks with him to the hedge behind the sidewalk.  Niles pulls a folding stepladder from behind the hedge.  He stands it next to the pole.  He then flips back his coat to reveal a tool belt, from which he takes a wrench.  (Who does he think he is, Batman?  And any seasoned burglar would have told him to go motorized, sacrificing silence for speed. - Mike Lee)  Looking up at the sign, he places the wrench in his mouth and begins to climb the ladder, but is interrupted by Eddie barking at something. He climbs back down, hurriedly sticks the ladder back behind the hedge, removes the wrench from his mouth, and moves Eddie back to the pole, whistling again.  Eddie repeats the leg-lifting routine.  A couple of pedestrians walk past, and Niles nervously waves and says \"Hi\" to them as they go by.  He whistles at Eddie again, who lowers his leg.  He gives him another treat, retrieves the ladder again, and again places it next to the pole.  He climbs the ladder and places his hands on top of the \"Daphne Lane\" sign.  Nervously, he begins to use the wrench to undo the bolts attaching the sign to the pole.  As he does so, he loses his balance.  Struggling to regain it, he inadvertently kicks the ladder away, so that it is no longer under his feet. He is left hanging from the sign.  Eddie barks repeatedly.  Niles is then literally \"caught in the headlights\" as we hear a car pull up.  The sound of a siren reveals the nature of the car. He stares mortified into the lights, still hanging from the sign. Eddie continues to bark.  FADE OUT.  Scene 7 - The lobby of the office building where Martin works as a security guard.  A woman in uniform is seated behind the desk, reading a book.
