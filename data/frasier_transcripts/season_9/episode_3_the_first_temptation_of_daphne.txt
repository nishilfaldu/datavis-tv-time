    _Act One_
    **RECIPE FOR DISASTER**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles is setting the table for dinner.  The doorbell sounds before 
    Daphne answers it.  Martin, weighed down with hunting gear, is 
    revealed._
    
     **Daphne:** Hey!
     **Martin:**[_grumbling_] Thanks, Daph.
      **Niles:** He-hey, Dad!
    
    _Eddie runs to him._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, boy.  You missed me, huh?
     **Daphne:** So, how was your trip, Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** Oh, the hunting was awful.  I didn't bag a damned thing.  
            [_hangs up his coat_] Duke and I sat there for two days just 
             waiting for something to happen.  It's like when Frasier took 
             me to see "Nicholas Nickleby."  Thank God this time I had a 
             gun!
      **Niles:** Dinner is almost ready.  Shall I set you a place or would it 
             make you feel better to go out and shoot your own eggplant?
    _Martin sits down before Frasier enters through the front door, looking 
    characteristically annoyed and bewildered at Martin's hunting gear, 
    which are laid on the floor._
    **Frasier:** Dad, what have I told you about bivouacking in the entrance 
             way?
     **Martin:** I'm sorry.
    **Frasier:** Well, how was your hunting trip?
     **Martin:** Oh, came home empty-handed.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear.  I guess that means for the next several weeks 
             we'll hear you grouse about the grouse and carp about the 
             carp. [_laughs at his own joke as he carries Martin's bags 
             over to the hallway_]
      **Niles:** You've been working on that, haven't you?
    **Frasier:** Well, there was traffic!
    _Frasier exits to Martin's room with the bags in tow.  A ping is then 
    heard from the kitchen._
      **Niles:** Oh, Daphne - I have to take the roast out of the oven.  I 
             need the recipe for the glaze.  Could you get it?  It's in 
             my briefcase; in the "Burnt Sienna" colored folder.
     **Daphne:** No problem.
    _Niles exits to the kitchen.  She looks at Martin._
     **Martin:** Brown.  But don't tell anyone I know that.
    _Daphne follows his instructions.  Frasier re-enters._
    **Frasier:** Dad - sorry to hear your trip was a bust.
     **Martin:** Oh, it's all right, it wasn't so bad.  You know, the worst 
             day of hunting still beats the best day of working.
    **Frasier:** You don't work either!
    _Daphne, holding the folder, walks downstage.  Something seems to take 
    her attention._
     **Martin:** You don't think it's work talking to you?  Duke, on the 
             other hand, is a lot of fun.  You know he can fit twenty-
             seven marshmallows into his mouth at one time.
    _A cricket is heard distinctly from within the apartment.  Daphne and 
    Frasier look around._
    **Frasier:** What was that?
     **Martin:** What was what?
    _The cricket sounds again.  Frasier flinches._
    **Frasier:** That!  That's a cricket.
     **Martin:** How did that get in here?
    **Frasier:** It must have stowed away in your gear; get rid of it!
     **Martin:** Oh, don't worry - Eddie'll take care of it.  Terriers are 
             born hunters. [_puts him down_] Go get him, boy.
    _Eddie responds to Martin's orders by chasing his tail round and 
    round and round and...
    
    Reset to: Kitchen
    Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Niles has taken the roast out of the oven.  
    Daphne enters looking rather uneasy, evidently from reading his files._
     **Daphne:** So.... This woman is in love with you.
      **Niles:**[_concentrating on the roast_] What?
     **Daphne:** Heather Murphy.  Says right here she's obsessed with you.
      **Niles:**[_realizing_] Oh, wrong file - you're not supposed to look at 
             that.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I can see why.  And when were you planning on telling me 
             about this?
      **Niles:**[_out of pure honesty_] Em, never. [_taking the files_] These are 
             session notes, they're confidential.
     **Daphne:** But she is in love with you?
      **Niles:** First of all I can't discuss the woman in this file...  which, 
             by the way, is clearly umber and not "Burnt Sienna!" I can 
             tell you that it's very common for patients to displace 
             feelings they have for someone else onto their psychiatrist.  
             It's called transference.  So even if a patient thinks she 
             might be in love with me, she really isn't.  And usually those 
             feelings disappear as therapy progresses.  Okay?
     **Daphne:** Okay.  
    _Pause._
     **Daphne:** So how did she tell you?  Did she come on to you?  Did she try 
             and kiss you?
      **Niles:** I can't tell you.
     **Daphne:** All right.  I understand.  Your little secret.
    _Niles waves his hands apologetically._
     **Daphne:** Just blink.  Once for yes and twice for no.
    _Frasier enters in search of the dreaded cricket.  Martin enters with 
    him._
    **Frasier:** I think it's coming from in here.
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** Dad has brought home a cricket!
      **Niles:**[_genuine fear_] A cricket?!  Get behind me, Daphne.
    _Frasier sees something on the floor._
    **Frasier:** Everybody freeze!   Don't-move-a-muscle.
    _Frasier, with small gestures, points to its position of the floor.  
    Suddenly he makes his move.  He stamps.  Everyone holds their breath.  
    Frasier removes his foot before proudly announcing..._
    **Frasier:** Well, I hope that cricket saw what I just did to this 
             toasted almond!
    _Frasier exits as the rest peer over the squashed nut.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier, munching away at a scone, is whining to Roz about the 
    cricket.  They are sat at a front table.
    _
    **Frasier:** I tell you, Roz, it was the worst night of my life.  Just 
             as I begin to doze off, the damned cricket would start 
             strigilating again.  Honestly, have you any idea what 
             it's like to be awaken intermittently throughout an entire 
             night?!
        **Roz:** I have a three-year-old, I can't remember the last time I 
             slept through a night.
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course, but this constant chirping and chirping, 
             over and over -- really, you can't imagine it.
        **Roz:** Really?  Did the cricket crawl into bed with you?  Did the 
             cricket throw up on you?
    **Frasier:** Gee, I wish I had a three-year-old so I could win every 
             argument!
    _Daphne enters the caf e and greets Frasier and Roz.
    _
        **Roz:** Hey, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Hey, Roz.
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi, Daph.
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane. [_sits with them_] Oh, that scone looks good.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it's all right.  They call it "Nervosa Berry," but 
             I'm convinced it's just yesterday's banana.  I have half a 
             mind to have a discussion with someone about it.
     **Daphne:**[_agreeable_] You should. [_here's the reason why_] So what do 
             you know about transference?
    **Frasier:** Hm?  Oh, more than most.
     **Daphne:** Is it true that patients can actually fall in love with 
             their therapists?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, yes, as a matter of fact it's quite common.  You see, 
             in a therapeutic setting a doctor's empathy can be misconstrued 
             as romantic interest, especially when the patient is of a 
             particularly vulnerable nature.
     **Daphne:** But therapists never return those feelings, right?
    **Frasier:**[_contemplating, perhaps with Diane in mind_] Well, they're not 
             supposed to.  But it does happen.  Eh, well, I mean, think 
             about it, really, it's... we are human.  Transference can be 
             very, very powerful.  I remember back in my days of private 
             practice, uh, I did have my share of female adulation.  
        **Roz:** Oh my God, were you able to cure them?
    **Frasier:**[_gives her a look_] I'm not a miracle worker, Roz!
    _Roz smells the scone - evidently wishing to get rid of him for a while._
        **Roz:** Do you smell bananas?
    **Frasier:** I knew it!  You smell it too! [_to a passing waiter_] Excuse 
             me.  This day-old scone is fooling no-one. [_the waiter passes, 
             Frasier stands in anger_] Don't you walk away from me.  Don't 
             you dare walk away from me.
    _Frasier chases the waiter offstage into the kitchen._
        **Roz:** Okay, so who is she?
     **Daphne:** Who's who?
        **Roz:** Niles' patient?
     **Daphne:** All right.  I saw one of his files by mistake.  The woman is 
             madly in love with him.
        **Roz:** So who is she?
     **Daphne:** Her name is Heather Murphy.
        **Roz:** Heather, huh?  That's trouble.  What else do you know?
     **Daphne:** That's it.  I only got a quick look at the files.
        **Roz:** So what are you going to do?
     **Daphne:** Nothing.  Niles said he can't talk about his patients.  
             So, what choice do I have?  I should trust him.
        **Roz:** If I found out some babe was after my guy I would have to 
             know everything about her.  What she looks like, her 
             profession, what she's being treated for.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I don't think that's relevant.
        **Roz:** What if she's a sex addict?
     **Daphne:** You can be treated for that?
        **Roz:**[_cynical_] So they say.
    _FADE TO:_
    **CLASH OF THE TITANS**
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    The cricket is heard.  When the scene fades in, Frasier is battering 
    the kitchen worktops with a fly swatter._
    **Frasier:**[_unsuccessful_] Damn it!
    _Martin enters, evidently used to his hunt madness by now._
     **Martin:** Oh, geez, are you still at it?  Why don't you go in your 
             room?  You won't even hear the thing if you close the door.
    **Frasier:** Close my door?!  And just concede defeat.  I know, here's a 
             better idea: I'll just move out and let him have the run of 
             the place!  That's good, I'll have two apartments; One for 
             me, one for my cricket! [_off Martin's look_] I tried closing 
             my door, I can still hear it.
    _It sounds again._
    **Frasier:** Dear God, can't you make him shut up?!
     **Martin:** That prayer doesn't get answered around here!
    _They enter the living room._
    **Frasier:** This is your fault!  You're the one who brought him here.
     **Martin:**[_sits_] What's the big deal?  If you were paying a ton of 
             money to stay in some country inn, you'd be loving the sound 
             of crickets.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I love a babbling brook too, but it doesn't 
             mean I want one surging through my condo!  I'm calling 
             an exterminator.
     **Martin:** No, you can't do that!  The chemicals are too dangerous for 
             Eddie.
    **Frasier:** All right, fine.  You have twenty-four hours to get that 
             intruder out of here or I'm calling, Eddie or no Eddie!
    _Once again, the cricket makes his noise._
    **Frasier:**[_looking around the room, incensed_] It taunts me!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Niles' Bedroom at the Montana.
    Daphne is sitting up in bed wearing a black teddy whilst Niles is 
    getting undressed.  She still has worry written on her face._
     **Daphne:** So, how was your day?
      **Niles:** Fine.  Thank you.
     **Daphne:** Why don't you tell me about it?
      **Niles:** What do you mean?
     **Daphne:** You know, couples come home, they talk about their day.  
             Why don't you ever want to share?
      **Niles:** Well, I-I... suppose I'm not used to it. 
    _He sits down on the bed while taking off his shoes._
      **Niles:** Maris always needed silence to cope with her chronic 
             migraines, Mel couldn't talk because she'd be wearing 
             the moulds from her teeth bleaching kit.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm interested.  Why don't you tell me something about 
             your day?
      **Niles:** Okay.  Let me think. [_suddenly, excited_] I saw the best pair 
             of driving gloves!
     **Daphne:**[_less interested than him_] That's good.  Anything else?
      **Niles:** I had a cob salad for lunch. [_beat_] You're right, that was 
             fun. [_stands_] Okay, I'm going to go; brush my teeth.  I'll be 
             right back.
    _Niles exits to his en-suite bathroom._
     **Daphne:**[_still anxious_] Okay.
    _Daphne turns on the television to take her mind off of the situation.  
    Mary Hart is presenting "Entertainment Tonight."  A Julia Roberts press 
    photo can be seen._
       **Hart:** Julia Roberts just signed on for twenty million dollars to play 
             a woman who falls in love with her psychiatrist.  Of course,
             she gets him in the end.  Sound familiar, Daphne?
    _Julia Roberts's photo is exchanged for one of Daphne, who gapes at the
    television._
    [_N.B. The photo used was an old press photo of Jane Leeves from season 
    five._]
    
       **Hart:** Look in the briefcase, I know I would.  And now let's hear the 
             details...
    _Daphne, realizing her subconscious at work, quickly turns off the 
    television.  She stares longingly at Niles' briefcase, but reaches 
    for a magazine instead.  
    
    She opens the magazine just to find a picture of a briefcase and the 
    words "JUST OPEN IT" stamped underneath it.  She closes the magazine 
    with confusion.  She cannot resist any longer.  
    
    Daphne gets out of bed, walks to the briefcase and begins to open it.  
    However, she is interrupted by Niles re-entering wearing his dressing 
    gown.  Daphne quickly turns around and sighs._
     **Daphne:** Oh, thank God.
      **Niles:**[_looks up_] What? [_smiles_]
     **Daphne:**[_covering_] I missed you.
      **Niles:** Mmm.  I missed you too.
    _They kiss and hug.  Something vibrates at his waist._
      **Niles:** Oh, my beeper's going off.
     **Daphne:**[_seductive_] Well, let's see what we can do about that.
      **Niles:** It could be an emergency.
    _Niles takes the beeper out of his pocket and reads the note._
     **Daphne:** Who is it?
      **Niles:**[_pulls out of the hug_] Ooh, uh, it's a patient.
     **Daphne:** That woman?
      **Niles:** I really can't talk about it.  Daphne, I'm sorry, I may be a 
             while. 
    _He exits to the hallway.
    
    Daphne goes to the briefcase and slowly opens it.  She checks that 
    Niles is well out of sight before she removes the documents and takes 
    them onto her lap.  She reads with frightened interest.
    
    End of Act One
    
    Act Two
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    The following day, Frasier has been trying to have a nap on the sofa 
    as Martin awakens him.  He is holding a shoe-box._
    **Frasier:** I was trying to.  I'm attempting to re-arrange my schedule.  
             Apparently, His Royal Chirpy-ness is nocturnal, so I have to 
             be as well.
     **Martin:** Well, I've got the answer to the problem right here in this 
             box. [_lays it down on the table_]
    **Frasier:** What, we couldn't squash him with the shoes we already own?
     **Martin:**[_taking jacket off_] Not shoes.  Eddie's vet told me to get a 
             gecko.  It's a cricket-predator.  You know, like you get lady-
             bugs to eat aphids, if somebody would let me grow tomatoes on 
             the terrace!
    **Frasier:** Dad, I told you, it's a condo board regulation: no fruiting 
             plants.
     **Martin:** Whatever.  Anyway, just give me a half-an-hour and I'll have 
             that pesky cricket out of the kitchen and inside this gecko.
    **Frasier:** I see.  So we set a lizard loose to catch the cricket?
     **Martin:** Mmm-hmm.
    **Frasier:** Then what? [_Martin looks confused_] We get an owl to eat the 
             gecko?!  Then we get a tiger to eat the owl? [_pause_] What eats 
             the tiger, Dad, tell me that!
     **Martin:** An alligator, for one, smart guy!  But that's not going to 
             happen and you know why?  Because we'll put a little harness 
             on the gecko so it doesn't run away.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Oh, this just gets better and better.
    _Martin goes over to the small table outside the kitchen.  He searches 
    in the drawer._
     **Martin:** I thought I had some twine here.
    **Frasier:** Well, I used it to stabilize a veal shank.  Why don't you 
             just make a little harness out of, uh...  the dental floss.
     **Martin:** Hey, that's not bad!
    **Frasier:** I wasn't serious... not my cinnamon waxed!
    _But it's too late and Martin's left.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **WHICH FLOOR IS THE
    "OTHER WOMAN"
    DEPARTMENT?**
    _Scene Two - Heather Murphy's Office Building.
    Roz and Daphne are riding the elevator to Heather's floor._
     **Daphne:** I've changed my mind, I can't go through with this.
    _Roz stops her from pressing the buttons._
        **Roz:** You have to, Daphne.  You know you're not going to sleep until 
             you see what this Heather looks like.
     **Daphne:** I thought I'd feel better once I'd got a look at her file, 
             instead I feel worse.  She's successful, well travelled, well 
             educated, what if she's gorgeous too?
        **Roz:** Daphne, you've got this all built up in your head.  Once you 
             see her, you'll know what you're up against.
     **Daphne:** I suppose.  But what if we get caught?
        **Roz:** We lie.
     **Daphne:** I'm a terrible liar.
        **Roz:** Listen up.  Lying is all about confidence.  As long as you're 
             confident, people will believe anything you tell them.
     **Daphne:** Are you sure?
        **Roz:** Frasier thinks I'm at the copy machine right now!
    _Daphne looks gobsmacked as the door opens.  Roz enters, confidently, 
    and goes towards the assistant.  Daphne follows nervously._
          **Roz:** Excuse me, we're looking for Heather Murphy.
    **Assistant:** This is her office.  And you are?
          **Roz:** Her two 'o clock!
    **Assistant:**[_checks computer_] I don't have anything on the books.
          **Roz:** This is unbelievable. [_to Daphne_] Make a note: Re-evaluate 
               all scheduling procedures, C.C. all department heads.
    **Assistant:** Heather'll be back in five minutes if you want to wait.
          **Roz:** Oh, we'll wait.  In the meantime, two coffees, cream with 
               sugar, think you can handle that?!
    **Assistant:**[_scared_] Yes.
          **Roz:** We'll be in her office.  Let's go.
    _Roz exits to Heather's office.  Daphne simply cannot move, she simply 
    stands behind looking fearful at the assistant._
        **Roz:**[_shouts in a style we'll now call Lana-esque_] NOW!
    _Daphne and the assistant both jump off their feet.  She enters the 
    office whilst he runs to the coffee machine._
     **Daphne:** You know, I think coffee might make me more nervous.
        **Roz:** We're not going to drink it.  I'm just trying to buy some 
             time so that we can look around.  She's got to be in one 
             of these pictures somewhere.
    _They pick up a photo on her desk._
     **Daphne:** There's a lot of people there.  Which one do you suppose she 
             is?
        **Roz:**[_referring to a woman who has just appeared at the entrance 
             to the office_] I think it's the one who looks like her.
    _Heather Murphy walks over to them._
    **Heather:** Excuse me, can I help you?
        **Roz:** We flew in from corporate for a meeting which the geniuses 
             in your department managed to screw up.  I don't know what 
             kind of monkey business is going on around here, but we are 
             this close to shutting this entire branch down.
    **Heather:** How could you fly in from corporate?  Corporate's downstairs!
    _Roz suddenly loses her confidence and flees from the office back to 
    the elevator._
    **Heather:** I'm calling security.  Who are you?
     **Daphne:** Who am I? [_with growing dignity and confidence_] Who am I?
        **Roz:**[_Lana-esque_] JUST RUN!
    _She does - past a very confused assistant carrying two coffees.

    Scene Three - Frasier's Kitchen.
    That evening, Frasier and Martin are sat on the kitchen stools.  
    Frasier is wearing an oven mitt for protection, while Martin is 
    holding a trail of dental floss connected to a gecko on the floor.  
    So, business as usual then..._
    **Frasier:** It's asleep, Dad.
     **Martin:** No, it's not.
    **Frasier:** Really, he hasn't twitched his tail for two minutes.
     **Martin:** That's because he's lulling him into a false sense of security.  
             The most dangerous part of a gecko is its mind.
    _Long Pause._
    **Frasier:** What-are-you-talking-about?  A gecko's brain is, like, this 
             big. [_holds his thumb and fore finger apart by less than an 
             inch_]
     **Martin:** Yeah, but a cricket's brain is only this big. [_holds his thumb 
             and forefinger touching each other_]
    **Frasier:** All right, fine.  Where were we?
     **Martin:**[_thinks a moment, then_] Ann Margaret.
    **Frasier:** You cannot just blurt out "Ann Margaret" like that.  I'm sorry, 
             we can only take ten women to Love Island, all right?  We have 
             to put a little thought into this.  I'll tell you who makes my 
             list: that dark haired temptress who works at the bookstore.
     **Martin:**[_smiling_] Lisa.
    **Frasier:** You know her name?
     **Martin:** Are you kidding?
    **Frasier:** All this time you've been going down there, I... I thought 
             you belonged to some kind of book club.
     **Martin:** Oh, there's a club all right!  You know, she got a belly ring 
             last week.
    **Frasier:**[_off in a fantasy_] That's fantastic!
     **Martin:**[_stands_] Here, hold onto this for a minute, will ya, while I 
             grab a beer?
    **Frasier:** Sure.
    _Frasier takes control of the dental floss as Martin moves to the 
    refrigerator.  Suddenly, the floss springs taut._
    **Frasier:** Ooh, Dad, Dad!  He's making his move, I can feel him!
     **Martin:** Oh, all right, give him a little play!
    **Frasier:**[_reels out the thread_] Right, I am doing...
     **Martin:** A little more-
    **Frasier:** Right.
     **Martin:** A little more-
    **Frasier:** Right.
    _The cricket makes its noise.  Then suddenly it is ceased by the sound 
    of crunching._
     **Martin:** He got him!  Reel him in!  Not too fast now, not too fast, you 
             don't want to tug at it.
    **Frasier:** I can't believe this worked.  That was amazing! [_picks up the
             gecko with his protected hand_]
     **Martin:** Oh great work, buddy.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.
     **Martin:** I meant the gecko.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, of course. [_to gecko_] Good job, well done. [_places 
             him back into the box_]
     **Martin:** Will you be using this floss anymore?
    **Frasier:**[_gives him a look_] I think we'll just let him keep it, all 
             right?
     **Martin:** Okay.
    **Frasier:** There we go.  In you go, little man.  Congratulations. [_puts 
             the lid on_] Well, that's it.
     **Martin:** Yeah.  Cricket's dead.
    **Frasier:** Gosh, even though I am savoring the newfound silence, I, uh, 
             sort of miss the excitement of the hunt.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, all right. 
    _Martin begins to exit._
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad... [_Martin returns_] Were you aware that the male 
             cricket chirps in order to attract the female cricket?
     **Martin:** Wow... and that cricket was doing an awful lot of chirping.
    **Frasier:** Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
     **Martin:** There might be another cricket.
    **Frasier:** There might be more than one.  I'd hate to go to bed and then 
             have to get up again.
     **Martin:** Probably we should just play it safe.
    **Frasier:** Release the gecko.
     **Martin:** Yes!
    _Frasier puts on the oven mitt again as Martin re-opens the box -- both 
    content with their newfound excitement.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Niles' Office.
    Niles is doing some reading as Daphne knocks on his door.
    _
      **Niles:** Well, this is an unexpected treat.
     **Daphne:** Niles, I have something to tell you.
      **Niles:** Is it that I'm the sexiest man you've ever known?
     **Daphne:** No. [_beat_] I mean yes you are, yes, but that's not why I'm 
             here.
      **Niles:** Is something wrong?
     **Daphne:** Well sort of. [_carefully_] It's about Heather Murphy.
      **Niles:** Daphne, I've told you.  I cannot talk about my patients.
     **Daphne:** You don't have to.  I found out by myself.
      **Niles:**[_thoughtful pause_] Did you look in my briefcase?
    _Daphne nods.  She is on the brink of tears._
      **Niles:**[_angry_] You read her file?!
     **Daphne:** I know, I know, it's bad.
    _Niles goes to the door and closes it for some privacy.  He raises his 
    voice.  He feels passionate about his work._
      **Niles:** Those files are confidential.  How could you?
     **Daphne:** Look, before you get going, you should probably know...
      **Niles:** No, there is no excuse.  That is the worse thing you could 
             have done!
     **Daphne:** You would think so.
    _Amazed and disgusted, Niles slowly turns around and stares at her._
      **Niles:** What else did you do?
     **Daphne:** I went down to her office to see what she looks like.  Well, 
             she never found out who I was or why I was there - I know it 
             doesn't make it okay.  But I was just so worried and I had to 
             find out who she was, and [_in tears_] I'm so sorry, I feel so 
             ashamed! [_cries_] It was all Roz's idea!  
    _Niles is speechless.  He sits in his chair._
     **Daphne:** Look, I know you're angry, but Niles, please, say something.
      **Niles:** Anger doesn't begin to describe it.
     **Daphne:** Niles...
      **Niles:** You have violated this person's privacy.  If she found out, 
             I... they could suspend my license.
     **Daphne:** I am so sorry.
      **Niles:** And you don't trust me.  How could you possibly think there 
             could be somebody else?
     **Daphne:** Because I was somebody else.
      **Niles:** What?
     **Daphne:** You were married to two other women while you claimed to be 
             in love with me.  Now that we're together how can I be sure, 
             really sure, that there won't ever be another "somebody 
             else"?
      **Niles:** Because I would never... 
    _He pauses, realizing he has been through this before -- and perhaps that 
    he has not yet asked himself this question.
    _
      **Niles:** Because this time it's different.  Our love is different.  
             It's not based on somebody's expectations or...  or anything 
             I'm supposed to be.  When I was with Maris, or with Mel, I 
             found myself thinking about you.  Going about my day or even 
             when I was in a session, I found myself thinking about you.  
             Well, now we're together.  I find myself thinking about you.  
             It's not going to stop.
    _Daphne, emotional, hugs Niles dearly._
      **Niles:** I'm still mad at you.
     **Daphne:** I know.
    _FADE OUT_
    **Credits:**
    
    In Frasier's kitchen, Martin and Frasier are attempting the "marshmallow 
    challenge."  They seem to be having fun - even though the cricket hunt 
    seems to have been forgotten.  Unnoticed by them, the floss thread now 
    runs from their hands down to the floor and into Eddie's mouth.  The 
    killer instinct has finally shone through.
