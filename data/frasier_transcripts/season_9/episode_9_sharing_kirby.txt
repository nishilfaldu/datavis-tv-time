## Transcript {Kelly Dean Hansen}

    
    
    **Skyline:** A yellow sun rises over the city.
    
    _ACT 1
    
    Scene 1 - Radio Station.
    Frasier is speaking to an internship applicant named Lucius.  He is 
    an intellectual, geeky-looking, lanky Poindexter type.  Roz is also present._
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll have to run this by the station manager, of course,
             Lucius, but barring any unforeseen circumstances, I believe 
             the internship will be yours. [_He shakes Lucius's hand._]
     **Lucius:**[_sucking up_] That would be wonderful.  But just meeting the 
             preeminent radio psychologist of this era has been a most 
             thrilling experience.
    **Frasier:**[_flattered, chuckling_] Well... 
    _Lucius exits.  Frasier closes the door._
    **Frasier:** So, Roz, what do you think?
        **Roz:** I think he's a pretentious, arrogant toady.
    **Frasier:** I love him, too!  Just think of it Roz - a triple major at
             Harvard University.  Why, he even plays the samisen! [_Roz
             looks puzzled._] Come on, Roz, the samisen. [_Roz is still
             clueless._] It's a Japanese guitar-like instrument whose 
             strings are plucked with a spatula.  Hmm?
        **Roz:** I can hardly wait for the intern talent show.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm so excited, Roz.  At last, I'll have a superior mind
             I can mold. 
    _At this point, Kirby Gardner, whom we last saw in "Don Juan in Hell," 
    appears at the window.  Kirby is best known to us as the son of Lana.
    Frasier tutored him in exchange for Lana setting him up with the 
    now-departed Claire French._
        **Roz:** Speaking of mold, what is _he_ doing here?  Are you still
             tutoring him?
    **Frasier:** Oh, God forbid! [_Kirby enters._] Kirby!
      **Kirby:** Hey, Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Hello!
      **Kirby:**[_flirtatiously_] Hello, Roz!  What have you been doing since I
             took you to my prom?
        **Roz:** Mostly showering.
    **Frasier:** So, what brings you here, Kirby?
      **Kirby:** I heard your radio station's looking for an intern.
    **Frasier:**[_panicking_] Radio station's looking for an intern... you say?
      **Kirby:** I was hoping you could hook me up. [_flirtatiously_] Just think,
             Roz, with me working here, we'll be together like, 24/7 five 
             days a week.
        **Roz:**[_looking somewhat disturbed_] Okay. [_She exits._]
      **Kirby:**[_taking out a folded paper_] I was hoping you could go over my
             resume.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, uh, all right, Kirby.  Uh... although I must tell 
             you that the station manager has final say in these matters. 
             [_He takes the resum e and sits down._]
      **Kirby:** I fudged a little bit on my job history.
    **Frasier:**[_irritated_] So you never actually worked at NASA?
      **Kirby:** Or Burger King. [_laughs_]
    _Kenny enters._
      **Kenny:** Oh, hey, Doc. Oh, is this one of the intern candidates?
    **Frasier:** Uh, well...
      **Kenny:** Kenny Daly.  I'm the station manager. [_He shakes Kirby's hand._]
      **Kirby:** Pleased to meet you.  I'm so stoked to get this job.
      **Kenny:** I like that in a candidate, Doc - he looks hungry.
      **Kirby:** That's amazing, dude.  'Cause I-I _am_ kind of hungry.
      **Kenny:** There's a vending machine right out there. [_Kirby exits._] 
             Hey, I love this guy!  He's a breath of fresh air.  Unlike 
             all these Ivy League snobs you've been prancing around all 
             day. [_He exits._]
        **Roz:**[_opening the door from the sound booth_] You're not really 
             thinking of hiring Kirby, are you?
    **Frasier:** Of course not, Roz.  I've got my heart set on Lucius.
        **Roz:** Me too, he plays the samisen!
    **Frasier:** Just... all right. [_He exits the booth.  To Kirby_] Uh, Kirby...
             listen, I'm terribly sorry about what just happened.
      **Kirby:** What?
    **Frasier:** You see, whenever Kenny sends someone out to the candy machine,
             it's a signal that that person won't be around anymore.
             [_playing it up_] We call it the "Hershey's Kiss-Off."
      **Kirby:** Oh, man, I really want to get this job.  So I can move in with
             Scoogy and Fat Tyler.  You know, live like an adult for once
             in my life.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I-I am terribly sorry.
      **Kirby:** It's not your fault.  You did everything you could, right?
    **Frasier:** Well... yes.  You know, I'll tell you what.  Um... I will keep
             my ears open for-for any opportunities, all right?
      **Kirby:** That would be great, Dr. Crane.  Something in law enforcement
             would be awesome.
    **Frasier:**[_looking at the resum e_] Yes, well... that shouldn't be too 
             difficult, considering you were trained... by the F.B.O.
    _He points out the mistake.  They part.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment.
    Daphne is seated at the table, and Martin is in his chair.  He is
    wearing an electronic blood pressure cuff, which he begins to remove._
     **Daphne:** Leave it, Old Man!
     **Martin:** It's bugging me.  I do not have high blood pressure, and it
             looks ridiculous.
     **Daphne:** I think it looks handsome.  Like those armbands gladiators
             wore, only inflatable.
    _Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Ah, Daphne, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Say, how was the doctor's?
     **Martin:** It stunk.
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane's pressure read a little high, so Dr. Stewart 
             insisted he wear this monitor for 48 hours.
    **Frasier:**[_hanging his coat_] Well _that's_ troubling.
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't worry, it's just a precaution.  It takes his 
             pressure at random intervals and sends the information 
             right to a computer in the doctor's office.  It's very 
             clever.
     **Martin:** It's not clever.  It's an invasion of my privacy.  Plus, they
             got me on that damn "Heart Smart" diet.  Two days of salt and
             fat - gone!  You don't get that back.
     **Daphne:** Well, stay calm, or you'll be on it forever.
     **Martin:**[_increasingly irritated_] How can I stay calm?  I'm just sitting
             here expecting this thing to go off any second.  I'm afraid to
             move.  It's like I'm a prisoner.  You know, that's just like 
             doctors, isn't it?  They're always finding some new way to
             torture you.  Well, maybe I _want_ my blood pressure to be high.  
             Did they ever think of that?  I mean, what...
    _At this point, the height of Martin's anger, the cuff gives off 
    a beep and begins to inflate.  Martin is troubled by this._
     **Martin:** There it goes!  You sneaky bastard!
    _Daphne rolls her eyes._
    **Frasier:**[_sitting_] Dad, you know, here's a suggestion, if I may.  Um...
             the next time you feel yourself getting annoyed, take a deep 
             breath and then picture your anger as a red balloon drifting
             higher and higher above the clouds till it disappears.
             [_makes a gesture to illustrate._]
     **Martin:** And that will get me back on nachos?  Well, I better get ready 
             for work. [_rises_]
    **Frasier:** Right.
     **Martin:** Daph, did you get my shirt back from the cleaners?
     **Daphne:** It's in your room.  I laundered it myself.  There's no sense
             paying for dry-cleaning a work shirt.
     **Martin:**[_upset_] Well, yes there is!  I told you, they make us buy them
             ourselves.  They cost a lot of money, you know.  And I have to
             go all the way down to the uniform supply house and you can't
             park there because of all the construction that's... [_the cuff
             beeps and inflates again_] No!  No!  No!  No, wait!  Wait! 
             [_very agitated, gives up_] Damn it all to hell! 
    _He goes to his room.  We see that Daphne is doing her nails._
     **Daphne:** Oh, you have some messages, Dr. Crane.  A Kirby called at 4:00,
             then again at 4:20 and 4:45.  It was upsetting your father, 
             so I turned the ringer off. 
    **Frasier:** Oh dear, I promised him I'd help him find a job in some field
             for which he's qualified.  And with the proliferation of self-
             serve gas stations, I'm afraid that narrows the field even
             further.
     **Daphne:** Why is it your responsibility to help him?
    **Frasier:** Well, the truth is I really didn't do all I could to help him
             get a job at the radio station.  Poor Kirby.  You know, maybe
             I should just turn the ringer back on. 
    _He does, and the phone immediately rings._
    **Frasier:** Well... [_He turns it back off._] Maybe after dinner.
    _Niles enters._
      **Niles:** Hello.  Hey, Daphne!
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles.
     **Daphne:** I'll get my things.  I'll be just a minute. [_She exits._]
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh, care for a quick sherry before you go?
      **Niles:** Oh, thank you.
    **Frasier:** So, how was your weekend?
      **Niles:** Fine, and yours?
    **Frasier:** Good.  You know, something curious did happen, though.  I was
             in a cheese shop, and I... ran into Reynolds. [_Niles looks
             apprehensive._] And he told me that he saw several bottles of
             Chateau Haut Brion '61 at your place.  I wasn't aware that
             you had Brion '61. 
    _He offers Niles, who is now seated on the couch, the sherry._
      **Niles:** Really?  Didn't I tell you, I stumbled across a case.
    **Frasier:** Really? That's wonderful news, Niles.  It's virtually
             unattainable.  So, how much do I owe you for my half?
      **Niles:**[_laughs_] That's very funny.  Reynolds made that same joke.
             [_drinks_]
    **Frasier:** Niles... we had a deal.  Whenever I've found a case of rare
             wine, I've offered you half.
      **Niles:** I understood that our deal only applied to vintages post 
             Nineteen... Sixty-five.
    **Frasier:** That wasn't part of the agreement.
      **Niles:** Well, I'll have to reread it.
    **Frasier:** It was oral!
      **Niles:** Oh, pity.
    **Frasier:**[_angry_] This is outrageous!  I can't believe you're cutting
             me out like this.
      **Niles:**[_breaking_] I'm sorry.  I try to be an ethical person, but wine
             is my weakness, and... this is really too good to share.
    **Frasier:**[_unimpressed_] I see.
      **Niles:** I will find a way to make it up to you.
    **Frasier:** Why don't you just sell me my half?
      **Niles:** I said _I'll_ find a way to make it up to you. [_Frasier
             shakes his head._] You have my word.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Your oral agreements aren't worth the air into which
             they are uttered!
    _Daphne enters._
     **Daphne:** Are we ready to go?
      **Niles:** Yeah. [_rising_] Look, Daphne, I was, uh, I was thinking rather
             than go to another boring movie [_getting his coat_] why don't 
             we go back to my place and kick off our shoes and, uh, 
             rearrange my library? [_Places Daphne's coat on her._]
     **Daphne:** Are you still doing that?  You said you'd be finished by now.
    **Frasier:**[_seated, indignant_] Yes, he _says_ a lot of things!
      **Niles:** It's a bigger project than I'd anticipated.
    _Niles and Daphne head for the door._
     **Daphne:** Can't you hire someone to help you?
      **Niles:** And let someone else touch my books?  Where would I find
             someone with your unimpeachable fastidiousness?
    _He opens the door, and they begin to leave._
    **Frasier:**[_rising, getting an idea_] Fastidious, you say?  Niles, 
             I believe I know just the lad that can help you! Kirby 
             Gardner!
     **Daphne:** Is he that boy who's been calling you all afternoon?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, he's very persistent.  One of his many fine 
             attributes.  You know, I've wanted to hire him myself, 
             but there was nothing available for him at the station.
      **Niles:** I don't know.  My books are the one thing I'm fussy about.
    _Daphne gets a knowing, but loving, grimace on her face at that comment.
    Frasier also doesn't quite know what to make of it._
     **Daphne:** Oh, please, Niles? [_plying him_] It'll give us more time
             together.
      **Niles:**[_giving in_] Well, if you put it that way. [_Frasier begins to
             chuckle with satisfaction_] Wait!  If I hire this protege of
             yours, will that make us even on the wine?
    **Frasier:**[_pleased at this good fortune_] Niles, you are too crafty for
             me. [_Niles looks as if he has put one over on Frasier._] All
             right, yes, very well.  That will make us even. [_They shake
             hands._] Have a good night, you too!
    _Niles and Daphne leave.  Frasier chuckles in a sinister manner,
    delighted that he has gotten back at Niles and dealt with the Kirby
    problem at the same time.  FADE OUT._
    **A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MULVEHILL**
    _Scene 3 - Niles's Library in his apartment at the Montana.
    
    It is as outrageously resplendent as everything we have seen of the
    Montana so far.  It could pass for a public library in a small city 
    or certainly for a school library.  There are books lining shelves 
    on every wall from top to bottom, and there is a sliding ladder that 
    moves along the shelves.  There is a complete set of furniture in the 
    center.  The middle of the wall separating the upper and lower stacks 
    is decorated with proverbs and quotations, such as one might find at a 
    university library.  (This is the first time this set has been used.)_
      **Niles:**[_as we fade in_] How's it going, Kirby?  I hope you're not
             getting lost in the 17th...
    _Kirby is standing on the ladder looking at an open book.  He is eating
    Chee-tos.  He wears headphones and rubber gloves.  Niles enters the 
    library and is horrified._
      **Niles:** Oh, my Lord! [_He removes a book that has been draped open on 
             a bust._] Kirby!!
      **Kirby:**[_removing his headphones, still chewing on Chee-tos_] Hey, Dr. 
             Crane.
      **Niles:** What are you doing?  You're eating in my library!  You're
             ruining my books! 
    _The books behind Kirby's head are in disarray on the shelves.  Niles 
    takes the book and the bag of Chee-tos from Kirby and begins to blow 
    the cheese crumbs off of the book._
      **Kirby:** Relax, bro.  I'm wearing the gloves.
    _As Niles turns on a light, Kirby places his foot on a column between
    the shelves and shoves off hard, sending the ladder quickly to the
    other end of the range of shelves.  He grabs a soda that he has placed
    on a shelf there._
      **Niles:** Kirby!
    _Kirby turns, sipping on the soda._
      **Niles:** Come down here. [_Kirby places the can back on the shelf and
             begins to descend._] No, no, bring your can. [_He does, and
             then comes down._] Sit down. [_He complies._] Kirby, this is
             completely unacceptable.  I-I just cannot allow this.
    _We see that the entire library is in chaos.  There are books piled
    on one of the tables and in various other places._
      **Kirby:** Whoa!  Are you gonna fire me? [_He places the can on an
             end table.  Niles quickly grabs it._]
      **Niles:** Well, I know that you have good intentions.  But I'm afraid...
             [_The phone rings._] Excuse me. [_He answers it._] Hello?
             [_irritated, to Kirby_] It's for you.
      **Kirby:** Could you find out who it is?
      **Niles:** Who's calling please? [_to Kirby_] It's Kristi Mulvehill.
      **Kirby:** Tell her I'll call her back. [_chuckles_]
      **Niles:** He'll call you back. [_hangs up_] Kirby... your friend Kristi -
             she's not related to William Mulvehill? [_He sits down._]
      **Kirby:** Yeah, that's her grandfather.  So weird how all you old dudes
             all know each other.
      **Niles:** Well, I-I don't actually know him, just know of him and his
             [_breathes_] wine collection.
      **Kirby:** Wine collection.  It's famous among the old dudes.
      **Niles:** Legendary, except he's so reclusive!  No one gets to see it.
             Frasier and I have tried everything but sealing ourselves in
             casks and rolling in.
      **Kirby:** Really?  I go there a lot.
      **Niles:**[_extremely envious_] You've been to the Mulvehill wine cellar?
             Have you seen the bottle that was owned by Thomas Jefferson?
      **Kirby:** Well, I'm usually with Kristi so, uh, I'm looking at the _jugs_ ,
             not the bottles, if you know what I mean. [_chuckles gleefully_]
      **Niles:**[_joining in Kirby's chuckle_] Oh, you! [_He hands back Kirby's 
             soda._] You know... [_clears throat_] it would be quite a thrill 
             for a wine connoisseur like me to meet William Mulvehill.  Do
             you think you could... get me in?
      **Kirby:** I bet Kristi could.
      **Niles:** Well, let's just get her on the phone and ask her, shall we?
    _He runs excitedly to the phone._
      **Kirby:** Well, I would, but... if I were unemployed I'd-I'd just be 
             too depressed to talk to her. 
    _He places the soda on the end table._
      **Niles:** Oh... unemployed, what are you talking about? [_He removes 
             the soda from the end table._] That was just a few harsh words 
             spoken in a moment of haste.  So the library isn't challenging 
             enough for you, we'll find something more suited to your 
             particular... [_hesitates_] talents. [_He hands Kirby the phone._] 
             Here's the phone. 
    _The doorbell rings.  He looks at his watch._
      **Niles:** Oh, that'll be Frasier.  Umm... why don't you call from the 
             kitchen?
    _Niles pulls at one of the book stacks, which moves forward to reveal a
    secret passageway._
      **Kirby:** Whoa!  Do they all do that? [_He pulls at the next one._]
      **Niles:** No!  No! 
    _He stops Kirby and hands him the soda.  Kirby exits and Niles closes 
    the book stack/door._
    **Frasier:**[_in the background_] Niles?
      **Niles:** I'll be right there!
    _Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Are you ready to... [_observing the chaos in the library_]
             Oh, dear!  Is this Kirby's work?
      **Niles:** Mm-hmm.
    **Frasier:** Niles, I owe you an apology.
      **Niles:** No, no. I understand.  I had it coming.  We're even.
    **Frasier:** Let me help you clean up.
      **Niles:** No, don't be silly.  I will be through this in a trice.
             Just you scoot.
    **Frasier:** Nonsense.  Let me help you.
      **Niles:** No, no.
    _Frasier begins to pick up some books.  Niles stops him._
    **Frasier:** Really, Niles, let me do this for you.
    _Kirby enters through the secret passage, interrupting them._
      **Kirby:** Oh, hi.  Grampy Mulvehill says only one person can go into the
             wine cellar.
    _
    Niles has fruitlessly tried to stop Kirby as he said the above.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_shocked_] Grampy Mulvehill?  As in William Mulvehill?
      **Kirby:** I told you.  Old dudes, they all know each other.
    _Niles frantically hurries Kirby back through the passageway._
    **Frasier:** I knew something was up.  You weren't going to tell me about
             Mulvehill, were you?
      **Niles:**[_with feigned shame_] I'm sorry.  I have _le vin fou._
    **Frasier:** Don't hand me that.  That is just a flimsy excuse for your
             outrageous selfishness, and what's worse is you are actually
             using that boy!
      **Niles:** Well, you used him to get back at me!
    **Frasier:** As you said, it made us even.
      **Niles:** Oh, I said that to get you out of here.  Look at my library!
             I hope you're happy!
    **Frasier:** Well, I didn't think it would be this bad!  I thought the boy
             could at least put a book on a shelf!
    _The volume of the argument has steadily increased.  Kirby quickly
    enters through the passageway._
      **Kirby:** I can hear you fighting about me from down the hall.  You're
             right, I don't deserve a job.
    **Frasier:** Kirby, that's not true.
      **Kirby:** It is.  Forget it. [_slamming the soda can on the table_] I'm
             a hopeless screw-up, just like my priest said! 
    _He exits, clearly upset and hurt._
    **Frasier:**[_calling after him_] Kirby!  Wait!
      **Niles:** What happened?  What have we done?
    **Frasier:** Isn't it obvious, Niles.  You've hurt his feelings. [_Niles
             reacts to this._] You know, I have a special relationship 
             with Kirby.  Maybe I'll just take him out to dinner.  Smooth
             things over.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm perfectly capable of making my own apologies.  I'll
             take him out to dinner.
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, on second thought, I actually did say some
             rather hurtful things myself.
      **Niles:** I think it's incumbent upon both of us to help repair his 
             damaged self-esteem together.
    **Frasier:** Very well.  We'll be two trained therapists working in tandem.
      **Niles:** Yes.  To repair the wounded innocent.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, that's very high-minded of you, Niles.
    _They both move to sit down._
      **Niles:** Yes, you too, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** You know, this is an utterly altruistic act, isn't it?
      **Niles:** As utterly as it gets.
    **Frasier:** I think we're of the same mind.
      **Niles:**[_brushing his shirt_] Oh, I think so, too.
    _They continue the charade, tapping their chairs with their fingers,
    as we FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT 1
    
    ACT 2_
    
    **RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE**
    _Scene 4 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin is in his chair.  Daphne enters with Eddie._
     **Martin:** Where have you been?  I'm starving.
     **Daphne:** Sorry, I was walking Eddie.  Haven't even been to the market
             yet.
     **Martin:** Oh, Daph, it's almost six o'clock.  How many times do I have 
             to... [_stopping himself, staring upward_] Red balloon... red
             balloon... [_smiles_] It's all right.
     **Daphne:** Well, good for you.  And I'll nip out to the market now.
     **Martin:** Oh, don't bother.  Let's just open a can of soup.
    _Frasier enters.  Daphne moves toward the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm off.
     **Daphne:** Enjoy your dinner.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
     **Martin:** Who took the batteries out of my remote?
    **Frasier:** Gosh, I'm sorry, Dad.  I needed them for my foot spa. [_He
             finishes putting on his jacket._]
     **Martin:** And you had to take them out of the one thing I need batteries 
             for in this house?  God forbid your royal feet go without 
             eucalyptus for...
    **Frasier:**[_warning_] Dad!
    _Martin pictures the red balloon again.  He smiles._
     **Martin:** That's all right.  There's got to be some other way to switch
             the channels.
    _Frasier exits._
     **Daphne:** Bye.  Well, Mr. Crane, I'll go and open that can of soup.
     **Martin:** Oh, would you turn the game on?
     **Daphne:** Sports?  Mmm.  Might be a bit too exciting.  Why don't we
             just watch a nice soothing movie?
     **Martin:**[_suspicious_] Like what?
     **Daphne:** How about "Message in a Bottle"?
     **Martin:** Oh, is that one of those movies that takes 45 minutes for
             anything to happen, and then you're sorry it did?
     **Daphne:** If you don't like that, we could watch "To Gillian on her
             37th Birthday."
    _With a mighty effort, Martin raises his eyes to the ceiling and 
    pictures the red balloon again.  He smiles._
     **Martin:** You pick.
     **Daphne:**[_excited_] Yes.
    _She runs to the TV.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 5 - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier and Kirby are seated at a table near the door.  Niles enters.
    _
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Well, imagine my surprise seeing the two of you here, [_with
             veiled vexation_] when the three of us have reservations for
             dinner at _Le Cigar Volant_ in half an hour.
      **Kirby:** Hi, Dr. Crane.  Dr. Crane invited me here for a before-dinner
             cocoa.
      **Niles:** Isn't that nice?  Frasier, may I have a word?
    _Niles puts down his briefcase._
    **Frasier:** Yes, of course.  Kirby, we'll be right back.
    _They move away from the table._
    **Frasier:** All right, now before you get started - I brought the boy here
             in order to ease him into this evening.  I was afraid that the
             sight of the two of us might bring up some unpleasant memories.
      **Niles:** I see.  So this has nothing to do with you trying to get into
             Grampy Mulvehill's wine cellar instead of me.
    **Frasier:** The fact that you even said that speaks volumes about you.
             Now let's get back before the boy starts to think we're talking
             about him. [_They go back to the table._] We're back now!
      **Niles:** Kirby, I just want to tell you how sorry I am for both
             Frasier and my behavior earlier.
      **Kirby:** It's no problem.  I forgave you as soon as I got that DVD
             player you sent me.
    _Niles fruitlessly tries to quiet Kirby._
    **Frasier:** Niles, may I see you for a moment?
    _They move again to the spot of their earlier discussion._
    **Frasier:** DVD player?
      **Niles:** OK, you caught me in a selfish moment.  I was trying to assuage 
             my guilt for the way I treated him.
    **Frasier:** And you weren't trying to buy Kirby's loyalty so that you
             and you alone could benefit from your Mulvehill connection,
             reviving your woefully flagging reputation in the wine
             community?
      **Niles:**[_feigning offense_] I categorically deny that!
    **Frasier:** So you did it just to burn me?
      **Niles:** I deny that.
    **Frasier:** But not categorically.
      **Niles:** Frasier, do I have to remind you, this is not about us?  
             It's about Kirby, whom we've abandoned in order to have 
             this petty spat.
    _They go back to the table._
    **Frasier:** We're back again. [_They sit._] So, Kirby, where were we?
      **Kirby:** You were asking me about Grampy's wine cellar.
      **Niles:**[_moving to stand_] Frasier...
    **Frasier:**[_cutting him off_] Not now, Niles.
      **Niles:** Fine.  I was going to leave this till later, [_he reaches down
             and grabs a box_] but Kirby, I saw these and I thought of you.
             [_He places the box on the table._]
      **Kirby:** No way! [_He opens the box and pulls out athletic shoes._]
             13's - how'd you know my size?
      **Niles:** Oh, I measured the footprint you left in donut powder on my
             floor, you rascal. [_He grins wickedly at Frasier._]
      **Kirby:**[_to Frasier_] These are awesome, [_hinting_] aren't they, Dr. 
             Crane?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, indeed they are, Kirby.  You know, you're going to
             need some togs to go with them.  I have an account at 
             Bidwell's.  What do you say I call them tomorrow and set you
             up?
      **Kirby:** Wow, thanks.  I never had togs before. [_Frasier laughs._] You 
             guys are so great, the way you keep trying to build up my
             self-esteem and all.  I wish there was some way I could take
             you both to the wine cellar, but I can't. 
    _He looks shrewdly from one to the other, knowing that he has them both 
    in the palm of his hand -- and suddenly very far from the dim youth they 
    have taken him to be.
    _
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    _They stand and move again to the spot of their earlier discussions._
    **Frasier:** Do you believe the nerve of this boy, pitting us against each
             other?
      **Niles:** Well, we're not going to be manipulated like this.
    **Frasier:** No, we certainly aren't.  Let's put a stop to it right now.
    _They go back to the table._
    **Frasier:** All right, Kirby, I'm afraid your little game is up, and I
             want to tell you something else...
      **Niles:**[_interrupting, reaching into his wallet_] A hundred dollars.
    **Frasier:**[_countering_] Two hundred dollars!
      **Niles:** Three hundred dollars!
    **Frasier:**[_getting angry_] FIVE hundred dollars!
      **Niles:**[_pulling out more money_] Kirby, have you ever been to Vegas?
    **Frasier:**[_playing his trump card_] He can't go to Vegas!  He'll be too 
             busy interning at the radio station!
    _Kirby has collected the money, and he sets it back down after hearing
    this._
      **Kirby:** No... way!  I got the job?  Thank you, Dr. Crane! [_He shakes
             Frasier's hand._] You just got yourself a wine tour.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckling_] Well... and thank you Kirby! Ha, ha!
    _Kirby collects the money again.  Niles, indignant, puts away his 
    wallet._
      **Kirby:** This is so awesome, and I promise, I will _not_ let you
             down.  I'm going to soak up as much as I can from you.  I'm
             going to be like your shadow.  You and me, Dr. Crane, from 
             now on!  You know, we should probably carpool to work.
    _Silence.  With a look of intense regret, Frasier understands the full 
    weight of the devil's bargain he's made.  Niles watches, immensely 
    enjoying the consequences of Frasier's desperate one-upmanship._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, could I see you for a moment?
      **Niles:**[_smugly_] No.
    _Kirby counts his money.  Frasier looks defeated.  FADE OUT.
    
    Scene 6 - Frasier's apartment.
    Daphne is on the couch with Eddie.  She and Martin are watching a 
    movie.  Both are clearly engrossed, but Martin is trying to hide it._
     **Daphne:**[_sobbing_] Isn't this the most romantic thing you've ever seen?
     **Martin:** If you say so.
     **Daphne:** There's no greater passion than that between a woman and a
             ghost. 
    _She sobs again.  The telephone rings._
     **Martin:** I'll get it. 
    _He rises to answer it.  As he moves to the phone and it continues to 
    ring, he looks back toward the screen.  He answers the phone._
     **Martin:** Hello? [_He glances back again. He lowers his voice._] Oh, um, 
             yeah.  Really? [_He glances yet again; still speaking soft 
             enough so that Daphne can't hear him._] I don't have to wear it 
             anymore?  That's great! [_He glances back._] Yeah, thanks, Dr. 
             Stewart. 
    _He glances as he hangs up.  Keeping his eye fixed to the screen, 
    he moves back to his chair._
     **Daphne:** Who was that?
     **Martin:** Dr. Stewart.
     **Daphne:** Are you all right?
     **Martin:** I'm fine.
     **Daphne:** I suppose you want me to put the game on, then.
     **Martin:** Well, uh, actually, he said there was a bit of a foul-up 
             with the computer and, uh, maybe I should wear it for a
             couple more hours.
     **Daphne:**[_still sobbing_] Well, that's too bad.  Do you want me to 
             rewind?
     **Martin:**[_quickly, slightly irritated_] If you're going to keep talking!
    _Daphne looks at him knowingly and grins.  FADE OUT.

    Niles's library.  Lucius, having meticulously placed Niles's books 
    in order, climbs down the ladder.  He asks for Niles's approval, 
    who is sitting reading a book and drinking a glass of wine.  Niles 
    nods.  Lucius takes his samisen, sits, and begins to play.  Niles 
    apparently  finds the samisen music soothing.  He continues to read 
    and sip, looking quite content.
