    _Act 1_
    **THE RING**
    _Scene 1 - A Jewelry Store
    
    Fade in.  Niles, Frasier and Martin enter the store._
    **Frasier:** Niles, are you sure you want to do this without Daphne?  You
             know, when Lilith and I got engaged, she insisted on being
             involved with the ring selection process.
      **Niles:** I appreciate your concern, Frasier, but I want to surprise her.
     **Martin:**[_pointing_] How 'bout this one?  It's nice and sparkly.
      **Niles:**[_looking_] That's an earring, Dad.
     **Martin:** Huh?  Oh, I guess I better put on my glasses.
    **Frasier:** Niles, prepare to relinquish your breath.
      **Niles:** Which one?
    **Frasier:** That one right there.
      **Niles:** Next to the gaudy one?
    _Frasier looks guilty._
      **Niles:** The GAUDY one?
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, which one do you like?
      **Niles:** I was thinking of something more along the lines of that one,
             with the feathered band.  What do you think?
    **Frasier:** I think it's a good thing I'm here to talk you out of it.
      **Niles:** I'm think I'm starting to regret bringing you along at all.
    **Frasier:** I think it's a...
    _A clerk comes up as they bicker._
      **Clerk:** Gentlemen, gentlemen, I'm sure we can find something that
             will bring you both a lifetime of happiness.
     **Martin:**[_laughing_] Oh, no!  They're not a couple!  My son Niles is
             here to pick out an engagement ring for his girlfriend
             Daphne.  And Frasier, who's been married twice, just came
             along to help him.
      **Clerk:** I'm very sorry, I'll come back when you've had more time to
             look around.
    _He walks away._
      **Niles:** Where did that come from?
    **Frasier:** I mean, REALLY!  To just assume something like that, out of
             the blue...
       **Both:** Latent!
     **Martin:** Well you gotta admit, it wasn't such a big leap, given the
             situation.
    **Frasier:** And just what is that supposed to...?
    _He stops and points at a case._
    **Frasier:** What bejeweled seraph has escaped her provenance now?
     **Martin:** I'm gonna go see if there's a line at the Orange Julius.
    _He leaves._
    **Frasier:** Now, I have several candidates, Niles, but before you turn up 
             your nose at this...
      **Niles:** That's it, right there.  That's Daphne's ring.
    **Frasier:** The very one I was going to show you.
      **Niles:** Stylish...
    **Frasier:** Classic...
      **Niles:** Stunning... Daphne. [_to the clerk_] Excuse me?  I'd like to
             see that one, please.
      **Clerk:** Excellent choice, sir.
    **Frasier:** Do you know her ring size?
      **Niles:** Oh, even better, her ring finger is exactly the same size as
             mine.
      **Clerk:** Well, perhaps you should try this on, then.
    _The clerk pulls the ring out._
      **Niles:** Oh, it's...
    _He drops the ring, Frasier bends down to pick it up._
      **Niles:** Oh, I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  I think it just hit me
             what this all means.
    _Frasier lets out a groan._
      **Niles:** What happened?
    **Frasier:** Nothing, it's just my back.  It's been acting up a bit in the
             last week.
      **Niles:** Well, here, do you want me to give you a hand up?
    **Frasier:** No, no, here's the ring, I'll just stay down here for a moment.
    _He hands it over, and Niles clumsily tries to put it on as people stop
    and stare.  Martin comes back in._
    **Frasier:** Does it fit?  Oh, here, let me help.  No, come on.  Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, it's perfect!  You know, I always dreamed this would
             happen!
    _Everyone in the store smiles and begin applauding._
     **Martin:** No, wait!  They're not a couple!
    _The applause continues as Frasier and Niles, oblivious, excitedly show 
    Martin the ring._
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez.
    _He turns and walks back out.  FADE OUT._
    **THE WORDS**
    
    _Scene 2 - Cafe Nervosa
    
    Fade in.  Niles is sitting at a table, reading some papers and choking 
    up.  He gets control of himself and takes a sip of coffee.  Roz comes
    in, and he breaks down again._
        **Roz:** Hey, Niles.
    _Niles turns the papers over._
        **Roz:** Is something wrong?
      **Niles:** No, no, I uh...
        **Roz:** Oh my God, is that Daphne's proposal?
      **Niles:** What?  No, I don't, what are you...
        **Roz:** Frasier told me.
      **Niles:** That gossiping ninny!
        **Roz:** Don't worry, he swore me to secrecy.
      **Niles:** I swore HIM to secrecy!
        **Roz:** So how's it coming?
      **Niles:** I'm afraid I poured so much emotion into this speech I don't
             know if I can say it all without crying.
        **Roz:** Oh, that's okay.  Women like a man who isn't afraid to shed a
             few tears.
      **Niles:** Last time I got all the way through it, I got dehydrated.
        **Roz:** Well, maybe if you cut it down a little bit, you could get
             through it before the waterworks start.  Let me take a look?
    _She reaches for the papers and Niles reluctantly lets go of them._
        **Roz:** Well, what about this paragraph here?  I mean, aren't words
             like "hopeless" and "despairing" kind of a downer in a 
             proposal?
      **Niles:** Oh, well this is where I describe my life before I met her.
             See, and then comes the part where she comes along and the
             meter changes to a more sprightly iambic: "Now-my-life-has-
             meaning."  Things that never made sense before suddenly are
             clear.  It's all because of this... wonderful woman.
    _He breaks down again._
        **Roz:** It's all right.  I'm sure there's other stuff we can cut.
    _The waiter brings Roz her coffee._
        **Roz:** Thank you.  Okay, like here: I mean, now do you really have
             to compare her to three different roses?
      **Niles:** Well, which one would you have me eliminate?  The one that
             represents her beauty or her passion or... [_breaking down
             again_] her sense of humor...
        **Roz:** Niles, you're just making this too complicated.  I mean, all
             we really want is for a guy to get down on one knee and say, 
             "I love you.  Will you be my... wife?"
    _Roz breaks down, Niles hands her his handkerchief.  FADE OUT._
    **THE WINE**
    
    _Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment
    
    Fade in.  Frasier, Niles and Martin are sitting around the dining
    table, tasting several bottles of wine._
    **Frasier:** Excellent.  Nice bite, smooth oaky blend.
      **Niles:** Mmm, lovely finish.  I think this is definitely a contender.
             How about you, Dad?
     **Martin:** Well, this one dislodged that piece of pot roast that's been
             buggin' me since lunch.
    _Frasier and Niles roll their eyes at each other._
     **Martin:** I'm sorry, Niles, I'm just not the right guy to help you pick
             a wine for your proposal dinner.
      **Niles:** Well, Dad, this is an important night for me, and, and I want
             you to play an important part.
     **Martin:** I guess it is an honor to be included.  Thanks. [_rising_]
             Well, time to cleanse my palate, I'm gonna get a beer.
    _Frasier and Niles chuckle.  Martin heads to the kitchen._
      **Niles:**[_leans forward_] Now?
    **Frasier:** Not yet.
      **Niles:** Well, exactly how drunk does he have to get?
    **Frasier:**[_pouring more wine_] To agree to take Daphne's mother out
             while you propose to her?  DRUNK, Niles.
      **Niles:** You're right.  Fill 'er up.  Go ahead.
    _There is the sound of a can being dropped in the kitchen._
     **Martin:**[_offstage_] Whoopsy.
      **Niles:** You're sure he hasn't had enough?
    **Frasier:** Dad, what was the name of that widow you dated several years
             ago?
    _CUT TO: the kitchen._
     **Martin:** You mean Claire Wojadubakowski?
    _CUT TO: Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Not yet.
    _Martin comes back in and sits down._
     **Martin:** Well, my taste buds are all sudsy clean.
      **Niles:** Let's dive right back in.  Bottom's up.
    _Niles and Frasier take sips from their glasses.  Martin drains his
    full glass in one breath._
     **Martin:** Boy, I tell ya, I haven't had this much to drink since the
             night I proposed to your mother.
      **Niles:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  That was quite a night, I was nervous as hell...
    **Frasier:** I love this story.
     **Martin:** And then she said "No."
    **Frasier:** What?  I've never heard this version.
     **Martin:** Well, she wanted to get married, but she just wasn't ready.
    **Frasier:** Well, what was it that finally convinced her to say "Yes"?
     **Martin:** Oh, you don't want to know.
    **Frasier:** Well, come on, Dad, what Marty Crane magic did you weave to
             get her to change her mind?
     **Martin:** Actually, I didn't change her mind, Fras.  You did.
    _Frasier looks shocked, Niles bites back a smile._
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!
    _He pours himself more wine._
     **Martin:** I'll never forget the look on that minister's face when your
             mother waddled down the aisle of Saint Barthalelamew.  Did
             you hear what I said?  I said "Barthalamar..."
      **Niles:** Dad, there's a question I've been meaning to ask you...
    **Frasier:** Niles, how can you change the subject after this bombshell?
    _Niles looks guilty._
    **Frasier:** You knew?
      **Niles:** Well, remember that time I had the chicken pox?  Mom told me
             to cheer me up.
    **Frasier:** Oh, go ahead.
      **Niles:** Thank you.  So, uh, listen, Dad.  Daphne and I, of course,
             want to be alone on the big night.
     **Martin:**[_laughs and nudges him_] Oh, yeah.
      **Niles:** And I was wondering if perhaps you could take Daphne's mother
             out for the evening.
     **Martin:** You want me to take out Daphne's mother?!  Is that what this
             has all been about?
      **Niles:** No!  More wine?
     **Martin:** I can't stand that woman!  But if it'll help you out, sure
             I'll do it.  I'll go out with her.
      **Niles:** Oh, Dad, thank you!  I will never forget this.
     **Martin:** Forget what?  Ha!  Just kiddin' ya.
    _Daphne and Mrs. Moon come in the front._
      **Daphne:** Hello, all.
       **Niles:**[_rising_] Hello.  How was the movie?
    **Gertrude:** Not bad, considering my daughter's famous sense of direction 
              made us forty-five minutes late.  Then she got me popcorn 
              without butter and kept shushing me, just because I can 
              predict what people will say next in a movie. [_sweetly_]            
              Hello, Marty.
      **Martin:** Ah, excuse me.
    _Martin rushes into the kitchen.  
    
    CUT TO: the kitchen as he comes in.  Frasier is waiting._
     **Martin:** I need a beer!  Now, now!
    _He gets a beer from the fridge as Frasier hovers._
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know we were just talking about the fact that I was
             a, a guest at your wedding?
     **Martin:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's just the least bit startling and I have always
             respected you and Mother and the decisions that you made
             throughout your lifetime, but this information does beg one
             question.  Dad, am I...?
     **Martin:** A year older?  No.  Your birthday's the same, we just faked
             our anniversary all these years.
    **Frasier:**[_collapsing with relief_] Oh, thank heavens!
    _Martin pats him on the shoulder as Frasier lifts his glass.  
    FADE OUT.

    Act 2_
    **THE DIVERSION**
    _Scene 1 - The Puget Sound Ferry_
    
    Fade in.  Martin and Mrs. Moon are sitting in a booth near the
    window.
    _
    **Gertrude:** You know, Marty, I'm not surprised you asked me out.
      **Martin:** Um, you're not?
    **Gertrude:** Oh, don't be coy.  A romantic boat ride to a remote island.
              I know when a man's trying to seduce me.
      **Martin:** Uh, Mrs. Moon...
    **Gertrude:** Oh, it was inevitable, really.  I mean, here we are, two
              comfortable old shoes, looking for new mates.
      **Martin:** Actually, I'm not that comfortable.
    **Gertrude:** Oh, maybe you just need someone to break you in.
    _Peg from Martin's work walks in with a friend._
        **Suzy:** Isn't that Marty Crane, from work?
         **Peg:** Right.
        **Suzy:** Didn't you two have a thing goin' on?
         **Peg:** No, we just made out at the office party.
        **Suzy:** Then what happened?  Blew you off?
         **Peg:** Actually, I think he was kind of interested.  He slipped a 
              Note in my lunch, he drove past my house, he called me a 
              couple of times and hung up.
        **Suzy:** And you didn't do anything.  What were you thinking?  He's 
              cute.
         **Peg:** He is cute, isn't he?
    _CUT TO: Martin and Mrs. Moon._
    **Gertrude:** What a wonderful sunset.  I bet you ordered it just for me,
              didn't you, Marty?
      **Martin:** Actually, the sun goes down almost every night.
    **Gertrude:** Oh, you!  Stop making me fall in love with you.
      **Martin:** Uh, you know, I think there's been a bit of a 
              misunderstanding here.  I didn't mean this to be a DATE
              date, more of a friendship thing.  You know, I really enjoy
              your company...
    **Gertrude:** No, no.  I should have known. [_getting up_] What could you
              possibly want with a dried-up old prune like me?
      **Martin:**[_following her_] You're not a dried-up old...
    **Gertrude:** Please, I don't want your pity.  I'll just stand at the bar
              and drink all night.  Even though my doctor told me one
              more episode could cost me me liver.
      **Martin:** Oh, now come on...
    **Gertrude:** If you want to pretend not to know me, I'll understand
              completely.
      **Martin:** Look, you've misunderstood what I said.
    **Gertrude:** Oh, then you don't think I'm unattractive?
      **Martin:** Unattractive?  You said that, not me.
    _CUT TO: the ladies._
        **Suzy:** It's not too late, go over there and say hello.
         **Peg:** He's with somebody!  It'd be weird.
        **Suzy:** You don't have to make a play for him, just say hello.  You 
              Can tell by his reaction whether or not he's still interested.
    _CUT TO: Martin and Mrs. Moon.  He leads her to sit down._
      **Martin:** Gertrude, this is wrong.  Your husband just left you,
              you're vulnerable.
    **Gertrude:** I'm not vulnerable.  I'm ripe and receptive.
      **Martin:** Okay, I'll tell you the truth.  You know, I was shot, right?
    **Gertrude:** Yes, in the hip.
      **Martin:** Except that the damage wasn't confined to the hip.   There
              were fragments that traveled... south.
    **Gertrude:** Ohhh.  You mean...?
      **Martin:** Yep.
    **Gertrude:** Yes, but you can still...
      **Martin:** Nope.
    **Gertrude:** But they have pills now...
      **Martin:** Nope.
    **Gertrude:** Acupuncture?
      **Martin:** Ooh!  Don't remind me!
    _He crosses his legs._
      **Martin:** No, the sad fact is, it just doesn't work.
    _Peg comes walking up behind him._
      **Martin:** I have absolutely no sexual feeling in my groin area,
              period.
    **Gertrude:** Oh, Marty, that's terrible.  Oh, I am sorry I brought it
              up.
      **Martin:** Oh, that's all right, no harm done.
    _Peg absorbs this, turns around and walks away.  FADE OUT._
    [_N.B. This is the first time we learn Mrs. Moon's Christian name._]
    
    **THE PROPOSAL**
    
    _Scene 2 - Niles' Apartment at the Montana
    
    Fade in.  Frasier is in the kitchen, hovering over the shoulder of
    Wolfgang Puck, who is cooking the proposal dinner._
    [_N.B. Puck was also a guest voice in[[8.08]](/frasier/transcripts/season_8/episode_8/mary_christmas.html "Mary Christmas") "Mary Christmas."_]
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, Mr. Puck?
    _Wolfgang turns with a frustrated look and slams his spatula down.
    Obviously this is not the first such interruption Frasier has made._
    **Wolfgang:** Yes, Dr. Crane?
     **Frasier:** I, I couldn't help noticing, the crab cakes are getting just
              a bit... brown.
    **Wolfgang:** They're getting beautifully crunchy.
     **Frasier:** I see.  Because when I said "brown" I actually meant more
              like "black"... like "burned."
    **Wolfgang:** They're Cajun.
    _Niles comes in._
       **Niles:** Is everything all right in here?
    **Wolfgang:** With the food, no problem. [_motions at Frasier_]
    _Niles smacks Frasier on the shoulder._
     **Frasier:** Everything's under control, Niles, we're all set.  You just
              relax, okay?
       **Niles:** I can't believe it, I've worked so hard to make everything
              perfect for Daphne and now the moment is... almost... 
              [_sniffing_] do I smell burning crab?
    **Wolfgang:** It's Cajun!
    _The doorbell rings._
      **Niles:** It's her!
    **Frasier:** Go!  God speed!
    _Niles hurries out.  
    
    CUT TO: the living room as he crosses to the front door.  There are a 
    number of people waiting on the stairs._
      **Niles:** Everyone, everyone, places, places!
    _They hurry up the stairs as he continues to the door._
      **Niles:** Coming, my sweet!
    _He gets to the door, but continues to stamp his feet until the others
    are out of sight.  Then he opens the door to reveal Daphne, looking
    quite haggard._
      **Niles:** Are you all right?
     **Daphne:** Don't touch me, I have the flu.
      **Niles:** Oh, you poor dear.  Here, here, here, come here.  Sit right
             down here until we're ready to eat.
    _He leads her over to the couch._
     **Daphne:** I can't eat.  I need me mouth to breathe.  I hope you didn't
             go to too much trouble with dinner.
    _Niles glances at the kitchen door._
      **Niles:** Oh, no, no.  I uh...  Hey, you know what?  A good cup of tea
             and you'll be rallying in no time. [_rising_] You'll never
             guess what I have planned for tonight.
     **Daphne:** All I want to do is stuff Kleenex up me nose, collapse on the
             couch and pray for death.
    _She lays back._
      **Niles:** Keep guessing.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, that's all right.  You lie here.  I'll go heat up some
             soup in the kitchen.
    _He heads for the kitchen.  
    
    CUT TO: the kitchen._
       **Niles:** Dinner's off.
    **Wolfgang:**[_turning_] What did you say?
     **Frasier:** Look, Niles, even if the crab cakes are a total write-off,
              we can still salvage a meal...
       **Niles:** No, no.  Daphne's sick.  Oh, oh, Wolfgang.  Could you open
              up a can of plain chicken broth and heat it up for me?
    _Wolfgang looks at him in disbelief, then turns back to the stove,
    shaking his head._
     **Frasier:** You're just canceling everything?  The choir, the string
              quartet, the dry ice?
       **Niles:** Yes, all of it.  I want this proposal to be the greatest
              night of Daphne's life.  What's the point of doing it if
              she's too sick to enjoy it?
     **Frasier:** Yes, but we spent weeks pulling all of this together.
       **Niles:** Well, we'll just get everybody back sometime when she's
              feeling better.
    **Wolfgang:**[_muttering_] Not everybody.
       **Niles:** All right, all right, listen.  I'll take Daphne into the
              guest room to lie down so you can get everyone out of here.
              Just be quiet, I don't want to spoil the surprise for next
              time.
     **Frasier:** Rest assured, she won't suspect a thing.
      **Daphne:**[_from the other room_] Niles?  I think there's a bird loose
              in here.
    _Niles pauses in confusion, then stares at Frasier._
    **Frasier:**[_guiltily_] I thought doves might be a nice addition.
    _Niles rushes out.  
    
    CUT TO: the living room as he comes in._
     **Daphne:** It looked like a dove.
      **Niles:** Oh, I think your fever is causing you to hallucinate.
    _He covers her eyes with his hand and grabs at a feather wafting down._
      **Niles:**[_loudly_] Come along, let's take you to the guest room for a
             good lie down.
     **Daphne:**[_rising_] Why are you yelling?
      **Niles:** Because your ears are all stuffed up.
     **Daphne:** No, they're not.
      **Niles:** They're not?  Oh, maybe mine are.  Gee, I hope I'm not getting
             what you have.
    _After they exit, Frasier comes in from the kitchen.  He puts on his
    jacket, goes to the middle of the room and quietly claps his hands.
    People appear at the book landing, on the staircase, in the dining nook
    and two short people dressed as angels come from under the table._
    **Frasier:** Shh, shh, everyone!  Very quietly, I have an announcement to
             make.  I'm terribly sorry, but tonight's festivities have
             been indefinitely postponed, due to illness.
    _All the people groan.  One of the angels speaks up._
      **Angel:** But we still get paid, right?
    **Frasier:** Yes, you still get paid.  Now, I need all of you to file,
             quickly and quietly, out the front door.  It is imperative
             that the young lady not know any of you were ever here.
     **Daphne:**[_from off stage_] I'm telling you, that room has a draft.
    **Frasier:** Hit the dirt!
    _Everyone hides behind things as Daphne and Niles come back._
     **Daphne:**[_o.s_] Why can't we sit in the living room and build a nice
             fire?
      **Niles:**[_as they come in_] No, no, no, we can't go in the living room,
             it... has... that... [_looking around_] of course we can go in 
             the living room and have a nice fire!  Come here and sit down.
             Do you want to borrow my pajamas?
    _She sits on the couch in front of the fireplace.
    
    Throughout the following conversation, Frasier, who is crouched by 
    the front door, directs the hidden people out with commando-style 
    hand signals.
    
    At each moment it looks like one of them might turn, Frasier gestures
    for everyone to freeze and swings the door shut, then opens it again
    and shoos them out._
     **Daphne:** No, I feel silly in those, they're so big and baggy.
      **Niles:** I'm the only one here who's gonna see you.
    _As Niles bends over and tries to ignite the fire, Frasier uses the 
    clicking of the flint as cover, as he frantically gestures for the 
    first group of people to crawl out the door.  
    
    As they do, another small group crawls from the dining area and 
    hides behind the living room furniture._
      **Niles:** Oh, how about some tea?
     **Daphne:** Not now.
    _He tries to ignite the fire again, and Frasier motions the next group 
    out, while signaling to the group further back and pointing to the 
    living room floor.
    
    As the clicking stops, Frasier clenches his fist, meaning "stop."_
      **Niles:** Oh, I have some of those raspberry candies you like.
     **Daphne:**[_pats the arm of the couch_] No, you stay right here next to me, 
             Niles Crane.
    _As he sits, she lets out a big sneeze and Niles edges away from her.
    
    Frasier motions the next group out, and the last group forward, 
    pointing to his eyes to tell them to stay alert._
      **Niles:** Get you a blanket, you'll catch a chill, darling.  Get you all
             comfy.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry I ruined our evening.
      **Niles:** Oh, you did nothing of the sort.
    _He kneels in front of her._
     **Daphne:** I don't know what I did to deserve you.
      **Niles:** You kidding?  I got the better end of this deal.
     **Daphne:** Oh, yeah, look at me: nose running, hair a mess, I must look
             a real fright.
    _She has another sneezing fit and Frasier hurries the last people out
    and closes the door.  
    
    He starts to crawl back towards the kitchen, then notices a server back 
    in the dining nook.  He starts, then gestures for the man to come out.  
    
    The server shakes his head, wide-eyed.  Frasier gestures firmly, anger 
    in his eyes, but the server shakes his head again.  Frasier gets down 
    on his knees and elbows and crawls commando-style across the floor,
    like it's a fire zone._
      **Niles:** You are simply the most adorable creature I have ever seen on
             this Earth.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sure.
      **Niles:** No, I mean it.  From your beautiful toes all the way up to
             your crusty nose, there's not an inch of you that I don't
             adore.
    _Frasier stops at the staircase and points to the server, directing him
    out.  The server hunches over and rushes to the door._
      **Niles:** You know, it's funny.  You could take a million years to plan
             the perfect evening, and you'd never come up with this.
             Daphne, I have to ask you a question.
    _Frasier looks up at this._
     **Daphne:** Hold on.
    _She takes a tissue and blows her nose, long and loud.  Frasier takes
    the opportunity to hide behind the staircase.  Daphne stops, takes a
    breath and blows some more._
     **Daphne:** You were saying?
    _Niles reaches in his pocket and takes out the ring._
      **Niles:** Daphne Moon, will you, and your beautiful toes and your
             exquisite ankles and your precious knees, elbows and arms 
             and fingers, shoulders... [_holds up the ring_] Will you marry 
             me?
     **Daphne:**...Oh, Niles!  Of course I will.
    _She throws her arms around him.  Frasier holds his hand to his mouth
    as he chokes up.  At the landing at the top of the stairs, a "royal
    trumpeter" comes out, mistaking Daphne's acceptance for his cue.  
    
    As he lifts his horn to his lips, Frasier rushes up the stairs and 
    takes him down with a flying tackle, preserving the silence.
    
    Niles slips the ring on Daphne's finger.  FADE OUT._
    **Credits:**
    
    As Niles and Daphne cuddle on the couch, Frasier comes from the kitchen.  
    Wolfgang Puck, gagged and still holding one of his pans, is slung over 
    his shoulder.  Frasier takes him to the front, deposits him outside the 
    door and checks to make sure he wasn't seen, closing the door behind 
    him.  Daphne looks up, apparently hearing the bird again.  Niles looks, 
    then shrugs.  They kiss and she lays back down against his shoulder.
