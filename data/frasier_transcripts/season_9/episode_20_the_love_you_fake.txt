    _**Skyline:** Doppler Waves emanate from the top of the Space Needle._
    
    _ACT 1_
    
    [_Scene 1 - Frasier's apartment.
    Eddie is sprawled lethargically on Martin's chair.  Martin and Daphne 
    enter from the kitchen._]
    
     **Martin:** Well, gosh...What did I just find in my pocket?  Is that tri-tip
             with peanut butter?  [_He moves to the couch and holds a bag in
             front of Eddie._] It is! [_Eddie does not respond._]
     **Daphne:** Hmm, no luck?  He's definitely coming down with something.
     **Martin:** Well, I guess I'm going to have to eat these myself.
     **Daphne:** Good idea.  Reverse psychology!
     **Martin:**[_munching on the food_] What do you mean?
    
    [_Frasier enters from the direction of his room, followed by a maintenance
    man._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well, Joe has found the source of the leak in my ceiling.  It is
             Cam Winston's brand new washing machine!  By God, for this time
             he's gone too far!  As if his noise and noxious presence at the
             condo board meetings weren't bad enough.  Have you ever heard of
             anything more..._fury inspiring!_
     **Daphne:** I certainly have not.  Imagine the cheek of the man, installing
             an illegal washer-dryer.
        **Joe:** Oh, they're not illegal.  A lot of the units have them.  You
             guys have a hookup in the hall closet where you keep all those
             hats...
    
    [_The look on Daphne's face at this revelation shows that she has found 
    something more "fury-inspiring" than Frasier's issues with Cam._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_quickly, to Daphne_] First of all, I had completely forgotten
             about the hookup.  Second of all, I believe the homburg is
             poised for a comeback, and third, we have a more immediate 
             problem, in the form of the evil waters of Cam Winston!
        **Joe:** Yeah, about that, maybe you could ask Mr. Winston to not use
             the machine till we get that leak patched.
    **Frasier:** Wrong!  We've got to teach Cam a lesson and shut his water off
             right now!
        **Joe:** That's, uh, not our standard operating procedure.
    **Frasier:**[_reaching for his pocket_] Well, I could compensate you for your
             pains.
        **Joe:** I gotta go all the way to the basement...
    **Frasier:**[_handing him some bills_] Perhaps this will help persuade you?
        **Joe:** This might get me as far as six.
    
    [_Frasier counts out more bills and hands them to Joe.  The doorbell
    rings.  Niles rushes in on a fancy motorized pedestrian vehicle.  He
    is wearing a billed cap._]
    
      **Niles:** Hello, all. [_Daphne looks curious and excited about the machine._]
             It's called a Segway.  My friend Raul at the university is doing
             an experiment on the psychological effects of technology, and he
             asked me to ride it around.
     **Martin:** Well, how do you like it?
      **Niles:** Oh, walking is but a distant memory!  Better yet, I can redirect
             the unused energy to other pursuits [_scooting near Daphne_] like
             playing Squash... or lovemaking.
     **Daphne:** Oh... Niles! [_They kiss._]
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, I'd love to stay and gawk, but I'm at war!  Come, Joe.
    
    [_Frasier and Joe exit.  Niles scoots around the back of the couch._]
    
      **Niles:** What was that about?
     **Martin:** Oh, Cam Winston.  Hey, can I get a ride on that thing?
      **Niles:** Nothing would please me more. [_Scoots up to Martin_] But, no. 
             [_He scoots past him._] One of the conditions of the experiment 
             is that I can't share the Segway with anyone - not even you, 
             Daphne, I'm sorry.
     **Daphne:** I can't believe you agreed to that!
      **Niles:**[_insincerely_] Well, it was damn difficult, let me tell you.  But
             I'll make a note of your disappointment in my daily write-up.
    
    [_Niles continues to scoot and gyrate around the room.  The doorbell rings._]
    
     **Martin:** Well, I know we can't ride it, but there's a poor, sick little
             dog here...
      **Niles:**[_interrupting_] Dad, again, saying "no" is one of the prices we
             all pay for science.  Now, who wants a Fudgesicle? [_He scoots
             toward the kitchen._] 
    
    [_Daphne answers the door to reveal Cam Winston, who is damp and wearing
    a bathrobe._]
    
        **Cam:**[_haughtily_] Good afternoon.
     **Daphne:** Hello, Mr. Winston.
     **Martin:** Hey, Cam, come on in!
        **Cam:**[_entering_] Is Frasier at home?  Someone has shut off my water,
             and I suspect his hand is at the spigot.
     **Martin:** Oh, geez, that doesn't sound like Fras.
        **Cam:** Then you don't know what he's capable of. [_notices Eddie_] 
             What's the matter with your dog?  He looks a little 
             glassy-eyed.
     **Martin:** Yeah, he's got a bug.  I've got to take him to the vet.
        **Cam:** Well, my mother's a vet, and she happens to be staying with me.
             I'm sure she wouldn't mind taking a look... even if it is
             Frasier's dog. [_He moves toward Martin and Eddie._]
     **Martin:** Oh, no, he's mine.  Frasier can't stand him.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, when he's healthy he jumps on Dr. Crane's bed, drools on
             his pillow, chews on his slippers...
        **Cam:**[_suddenly pleased_] Really?  We've got to get this little rascal
             back up on his feet!
    
    [_He and Martin laugh as he pets Eddie.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 2 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin is lying on the couch, playing with Eddie, who is obviously
    back to normal.
    
    Daphne enters, carrying a basket of laundry from the direction of 
    her room._]
    
     **Daphne:** I've done some calculating, and in the last nine years, I've
             carried 2.8 tons of laundry approximately 106.4 miles back and 
             forth to the basement.  That's the same as carrying an SUV on
             my back to Canada!
     **Martin:**[_sprawled on the couch petting and feeding Eddie_] Maybe we
             should ask him to buy a washer-dryer.
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastically_] Oh, there's an idea!  I was going to suggest
             moving the apartment closer to the laundry room. [_She opens
             the door as Cam's mother is about to knock._] Hello, Dr.
             Winston.
    
    [_Cam's mother is an attractive African-American woman in her early 60's.
    She enters._]
    
       **Cora:** Hello, Daphne.  Martin.  I just came by to check on my patient.
     **Daphne:** Oh, he's much better.  I'm off to do the laundry.
       **Cora:** You don't have your own here?
     **Daphne:**[_pausing_] No.  We have a hat museum. 
    
    [_She exits with the laundry._]
    
       **Cora:**[_approaching the couch_] How's our boy?
     **Martin:** Oh he's doing great!  Those antibiotics workes wonders.  How
             about a cup of coffee?
       **Cora:** Thanks.  Cream, no sugar.
     **Martin:** Okay. [_He goes to prepare the coffee._]
       **Cora:**[_examining Eddie_] He looks good!
     **Martin:** Well, Eddie's tough.  Plus the smartest dog ever!
       **Cora:** I always thought Border Collies were the smartest dogs.
     **Martin:**[_laughing with mock disdain_] Well, it's obvious you haven't had
             much exposure to dogs.  What were you, a zoo doctor? [_He
             returns with the coffee._]
       **Cora:** No, I just treat pets...and their owners' egos.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, tell me!  Cat people.  Well, it's really handy having
             a vet right here in the building.
       **Cora:** Well, it's only temporary.  They're doing some remodeling on my
             house.  It was only supposed to take a few weeks... then Cam
             found out.  Suddenly I'm getting new bay windows and a kitchen 
             based on something he saw in English Home Magazine.  You have
             no idea.
     **Martin:** No, unfortunately, I do.
    
    [_Frasier enters from his room._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Dad.  Oh, Dr. Winston.
       **Cora:** Hello, Frasier.  Martin, I've got to be going.
     **Martin:** Oh, well thanks for stopping by to see Eddie.
       **Cora:** It was no problem.  Oh, Frasier, I almost forgot.  This is for
             you from Cam. 
    
    [_She hands Martin an envelope which she was holding when she entered.  
    Martin passes it to Frasier._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Winston.  Nice seeing you again.
    
    [_Martin and Cora approach the door and exchange goodbyes.  Cora exits._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_suspicious_] What was that about?
     **Martin:** Well, she just came by to see Eddie.  Kind of a medical-slash-
             social visit. [_He moves to his chair._]
    **Frasier:** Social!  Dear God, don't tell me that you and that _scoundrel's_
             mother...
     **Martin:** Hey, Frasier, take it easy.  We just had a cup of coffee.
    
    [_Frasier opens the envelope and reads the paper inside.  He gives a 
    scornful laugh._]
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, all the pieces suddenly fit. [_He sits at the table._]
     **Martin:** What is it?
    **Frasier:** It's a bill from Cam.  Apparently turning off his water has
             ruined the clothes that were in his washing machine.  Those 
             clothes were already ruined just by being on Cam Winston!
     **Martin:**[_reacting to Frasier's childishness_] Well, then don't pay him.
             Have another fight.
    **Frasier:**[_rising_] The battle is joined.  I will not let that--that Mata
             Hari drag you into this.  From this day forward, no more Winstons
             in this, my house!
    
    [_Frasier exits toward his room in a huff.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 3 - The lobby of Frasier's building.
    Martin is checking the mail.  Cora approaches._]
    
       **Cora:** Hey, Marty!
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, Cora!
    
    [_She approaches him and bends to pet Eddie._]
    
     **Martin:** Ooh, be careful.  If Frasier catches you petting Eddie, it'll be
             the pound for him.
       **Cora:** Cam actually forbade me from coming to your apartment.  And
             they're so alike you'd think they'd get along.
    
    [_Martin laughs.  Cam crosses the hall to the elevator.  Martin sees him._]
    
     **Martin:** Hi, Cam.
        **Cam:** Good afternoon, Mr. Crane. [_The elevator opens._] Come along
             mother. [_singsong_] I've already checked the mail. 
    
    [_He is very uncomfortable._]
    
       **Cora:** I'll be up in a minute!  Don't worry.
        **Cam:** Very well. [_He pauses, unsure of what to do or say._] Carry on.
    
    [_He enters the elevator, which closes.  He continues to display
    an uncomfortable, indignant look on his face._]
    
       **Cora:** I can't believe that's my son!  What has gotten into him?
     **Martin:** Oh, why would they want to drag us into their feud?
       **Cora:** I think it's because if we're friends, then they at least have
             to try to be nice.
     **Martin:** You know what, we should get married.  Really make them suffer.
       **Cora:**[_laughing_] Oh, my!  It'd be worth it just to see the looks on
             their faces!
    
    [_They laugh, obviously enjoying each other's company as well as making
    fun of their sons.  Frasier enters, witnessing the laughter from behind._]
    
    **Frasier:** Dad! 
     **Martin:** Oh.
    **Frasier:** Dr. Winston.  I see you've checked the mail already.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, here you go.
    
    [_Frasier takes the mail.  Martin waves.  Frasier moves to the elevator
    and nods for Martin to join him at the elevator.  He repeats this gesture.
    The elevator opens.  
    
    As Frasier enters, Martin and Cora have their backs turned to him.  
    Martin, seized with a sudden inspiration, slips his hand into Cora's.  
    The elevator closes on Frasier, who has a look of utter horror on his 
    face.
    
    Martin and Cora double over with laughter.  Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT 1
    
    ACT 2_
    
    [_Scene 4 - Cam's apartment.
    The layout is exactly the same as Frasier's, and the decor is tastefully
    eclectic, emphasizing how similar Cam and Frasier really are.  
    
    Cora, wearing a long pink dressing gown, opens the door to reveal Martin, 
    who is wearing the robe we have seen many times before._]
    
       **Cora:**[_whispering_] Good morning.
     **Martin:** Good morning.  Is he still asleep?
       **Cora:** I just heard his alarm so we have to hurry. [_they rush to the
             dining area_]
     **Martin:** I can't believe we're doing this.  It's so mean!
       **Cora:** I know.  Isn't it great?
    
    [_As they run offstage, Cam enters the living room in a fashionable
    dressing gown.  He opens the door to get his newspaper, and turns to 
    see Cora and Martin entering from the opposite hallway._]
    
       **Cora:** Good morning, Sweetheart!
     **Martin:** Oh, hello, Cam.
    
    [_Cam stares in a stupor of disbelief.  Cora goes into the kitchen
    as Martin sits at the dinner table._]
    
        **Cam:** Hi...
     **Martin:** Oh, flip you for the sports page!  Oh, I don't have a quarter.
             I'll just get my pants. 
    
    [_He gestures toward the back of the apartment and starts to rise.  
    Cam immediately hands him the whole paper._]
    
     **Martin:** Oh, thanks, buddy!
       **Cora:**[_sticks her head out_] Can I fix you some breakfast, baby?
     **Martin:** Oh, just toast and coffee.
       **Cora:**[_suggestively_] I was talking to Cam!
     **Martin:**[_chuckling with feigned embarassment_] Oh... whoops.
        **Cam:**[_stonefaced_] You know, actually, I'm not that hungry.  I'll...
             get something on the way to work.
    
    [_Cam turns, knocking one of his knicknacks off a shelf and nervously
    catching it.  He exits to the rear.  Martin hurriedly stands up._]
    
     **Martin:**[_toward the kitchen_] Psst!
       **Cora:**[_entering_] That was perfect!
     **Martin:** You don't think we went to far, do you?
       **Cora:** Not yet.
    
    [_They hurriedly exit._]
    
    [_Scene 5 - Quick dissolve to Frasier's apartment, which as we know is directly 
    below Cam's.
    
    Martin and Cora hurriedly enter.  They rush to the dining table, as
    Frasier is heard in the background bellowing "Daphne!" with anguish._]
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne!  Daphne!  Daphne!! 
    
    [_He runs into the living room wearing pajamas and stops short 
    at the sight of Martin and Cora, who is looking at a newspaper.  
    He grins stupidly._] 
    
    **Frasier:** Dr. Winston!
     **Martin:** Morning!
       **Cora:** Morning.
    
    [_Throughout the scene, Frasier enunciates in a strained voice, 
    concealing a combination of nervousness, embarrassment, and 
    seething anger._] 
    
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Good morning.  How did this... How did you... 
             sleep?
     **Martin:**[_grinning widely_] Like a couple of logs.
       **Cora:** More like two baby kittens curled up in a tight fuzzy ball.
    
    [_Martin laughs with feigned embarassment.  Frasier looks like he is
    about to explode._]
    
     **Martin:** God, you're cute!  Isn't she, Frasier?
       **Cora:**[_notices time_] Oh dear, I should probably go.
     **Martin:** Aww...
       **Cora:** Bye, Sweetie.
     **Martin:** Bye, Sweetheart.
    
    [_They kiss briefly on the lips._]
    
       **Cora:** Bye, Frasier.
    
    [_She goes toward the door, followed by Martin._]
    
    **Frasier:** Good-bye.  Nice to see you. 
    
    [_Cora exits, Martin closes the door._] 
    
    **Frasier:** What the hell is going on?!
     **Martin:** What does it look like?
    **Frasier:** Dad, are you crazy?  She's a Winston!  She's probably just
             leading you on so she can break your heart!  That's exactly
             the kind of thing Cam would do to hurt me.
     **Martin:** Boy, you know, I finally find a woman I like, and who seems to
             like me, and all you can think about is your stupid feud.
    
    [_Frasier retreats, but tries another tack._]
    
    **Frasier:** I'm just a little surprised.  I didn't realize things were
             going so fast.
     **Martin:** Well, then it's a good thing you found out, because things
             could get more serious--a lot more serious.
    **Frasier:** What does that mean?!
     **Martin:** Well, let's just say, I wouldn't mind having a stepson.
    
    [_Martin exits to the hall, leaving Frasier gaping with horror._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_recovering_] Dad, now you're just provoking me, 
             aren't you? [_calling after him_] Dad?  Dad!  Are you?
    
    [_Daphne enters from her room._]
    
     **Daphne:** Good morning, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:**[_seething_] Theeeere you are.  
    
    [_He holds up a dark sock._]
    
    **Frasier:** What is the meaning of _this_?  Where is his mate?
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry.  I don't know what you're talking about.
    **Frasier:** My favorite pair of socks reduced to a single argyle!  Nor is
             this the only example.  The keen observer yesterday would
             have noticed that I left the apartment wearing _two shades_
             of black!  Explanation, please!
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.  I'm forced to do the laundry downstairs,
             and I guess your socks are just too tempting to the neighbors.
             Of course, you're welcome to go down there yourself and stand
             guard.
    
    [_Frasier nods in indignation during this speech._]
    
    **Frasier:** I see.  But if we had our own washer-dryer, there would 
             be no more lost socks. [_seething_] I will not be strong-
             armed by threats against my laundry!
     **Daphne:** Suit yourself.  I'm off to do a load of your pinks.
    **Frasier:** I don't have any pinks.
     **Daphne:**[_exiting to the kitchen_] You will.
    
    [_Frasier has a mortified and defeated look on his face.  Fade out._]
    
    **SPEAKING OF SEGWAYS...**
    
    [_Scene 6 - Cafe Nervosa.
    Fade in over the opening lines.  Roz and Frasier are sitting together._]
    
        **Roz:** Are you okay?
    **Frasier:**[_with repressed agitation_] I'm fine.
        **Roz:** You seem like you've been in a lousy mood lately.
    **Frasier:** It's just that they put soy milk in my latte.  I don't like
             soy milk.  If it doesn't come from a teat or an udder, it 
             isn't milk. [_looks out the window_] Oh, terrific.  Here comes 
             Niles on his fabulous "showing up Frasier" contraption. 
             All he wants is attention, so don't give him any!
    
    [_Niles cruises toward them on the Segway, still wearing the cap.
    Frasier looks away, while Roz and everyone else points and chatters
    in excitement._]
    
      **Niles:** Greetings, foot people!  How are things back in the 20th
             Century?
        **Roz:**[_rising_] Wow!  That looks like fun!
      **Niles:** Fun?  Well, I suppose it is.  I never really thought about
             it.  You see, the Segway is more of a productivity tool.
        **Roz:** Do you think I could...
      **Niles:**[_interrupting_] No, go away. [_He cruises away from them._]
        **Roz:** It's not the only tool.
    
    [_The waiter hands Niles a coffee.  This is the same waiter that 
    Frasier was unable to stymie in the previous episode, "Deathtrap"[[9.19]](/frasier/transcripts/season_9/episode_19/deathtrap.html "Deathtrap")._]
    
      **Niles:** Oh, I haven't ordered yet.
     **Waiter:** It's on the house.  We love the machine.
    
    [_A crowd of onlookers looks admiringly at Niles.  Frasier shakes
    his head in disgust._]
    
      **Niles:** That is sooo nice!
    **Frasier:** You know, I think I've seen just about enough.  Free food
             and drink, just because you showed them something new.  I'll
             tell you what.  Let's all paint our bottoms and run to the
             sandwich shop!
      **Niles:** My, my, feelings of inadequacy... typical reaction from the
             unwheeled.  I'll make a note of your grumpiness.
    **Frasier:** If I'm grumpy, it's because of Cam Winston.  Do you realize
             that Dad and Cam's mother are dating?
      **Niles:** Yes, I do and I think it's great.  Honestly, Frasier, you 
             have to loosen up. [_enunciating to everybody as he cruises
             away_] Openness to new ideas is the hallmark of our new
             century!
    
    [_As he exits, the crowd erupts in applause.  Roz and Frasier look at
    each other with disgust._]
    
        **Roz:** Don't you hope he gets hit by a car?
    **Frasier:** Mmm... Excuse me, can I please get another cup of coffee?  No
             soy milk this time. 
    
    [_He hands his cup to the waiter._]
    
        **Roz:** So that's what's bugging you.  Your dad has a new girlfriend.
    **Frasier:** No, I'm just afraid he's going to get hurt.
        **Roz:** No you're not, you're afraid you're going to have to be nice
             to Cam.
    **Frasier:** I am nice!  Cam's insufferable.
        **Roz:** Okay, fine, whatever,here's what I'd do.  Be the first one to
             make peace.  Then you'll be the bigger man to your dad and to
             his girlfriend, and it'll drive Cam nuts.
    
    [_Frasier's cell phone rings._]
    
    **Frasier:** That's good, Roz.  Seize the high ground.  You know, I'll offer
             Cam an apology and he'll be trumped. [_He chuckles as he answers
             his phone._] Hello?  Cam!  I was just about to call _you_.  A
             truce, you say?  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.  You're break...
             up!  I'm afraid my bat... is low on pow- 
    
    [_He quickly cuts off the line and folds up the phone._]  
    
    **Frasier:** Son of a bitch is trying to steal my high ground!
    
    [_Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 7 - Cam's apartment.
    Cam opens the door to Frasier._]
    
        **Cam:** Hello, Crane.  Glad you could make it... I guess.
    **Frasier:** Spare me your honey-glazed pleasantries, Cam.  I am here to 
             roll up my sleeves and end our feud.
        **Cam:** As am I.  That's why I called you.
    **Frasier:** Just for the record, it was my idea to apologize first.
        **Cam:** Well, that seems appropriate, since you're the one who shut off the
             water and ruined my clothes.
    **Frasier:** That, sir, is a fraction of the story.  Since you moved into
             this building, you have encroached upon my parking space, you
             have undermined my position with the condo board, and you killed
             a magnificent Virginia Creeper.
        **Cam:** Which you gleefully encouraged to climb the balcony and choke my
             dangling ivy!
    **Frasier:** I thought it was marijuana!
        **Cam:** Dangling ivy looks nothing like marijuana!
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sure I wouldn't know.
    
    [_With that, he turns away as if he's just scored a point._]
    
        **Cam:** This is getting us nowhere, Crane.
    **Frasier:**[_relenting_] Agreed, agreed.  I guess we'll never really see eye to eye, 
             but I am resolved to put aside our differences for the sake 
             of our parents.
    
    [_Cam has produced a bottle of sherry and two glasses._]
    
        **Cam:** For the sake of our parents.  Where are they anyway?
    **Frasier:** Downstairs watching _Court TV_.
        **Cam:** Ah.  It's all about romance with you Cranes, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Now, you see, there you go again.  I lower my guard and you
             slap me in the face.
        **Cam:** All right, I apologize.  And as a token of my sincerity, I 
             pledge to pay whatever damage my washer-dryer may have caused.
    
    [_Cam offers Frasier a glass._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well done.  And in the same spirit of hatchet-burying, I agree
             to pay for your ruined clothes. Cheers. 
    
    [_They toast, then Frasier offers his hand.  Cam starts to take it, 
    but pulls it away._]
    
        **Cam:** Since things seem to be off on such a good foot, perhaps now is
             a good time to discuss the mailbox situation.
    **Frasier:** You want to switch, don't you?
        **Cam:** As a tall man, I dislike having to stoop for my mail.
    **Frasier:** Indeed.  Well, I would prefer to put aside that explosive issue
             until we're sure the truce will hold.
        **Cam:** I see.  Fair enough.
    
    [_Cam offers his hand.  Frasier starts to take it, but pulls it away._]
    
    **Frasier:** Unless you're willing to agree on some sort of noise abatement
             framework.  You see, you have a unique sliding gait, Cam.  When
             you wear your heeled boots, the resultant shh-clop, shh-clop,
             shh-clop... well, it just sounds like a dancing pony in my
             apartment.
        **Cam:** Perhaps we should get some paper so we can write all this down.
    
    [_As Frasier nods in agreement, and Cam puts down his glass, 
    we dissolve to:_]
    
    [_Scene 8 - Time fade.
    Frasier and Cam are now seated.  The sherry bottle sits nearly empty
    on the coffee table, surrounded by seven or eight pieces of crinkled
    yellow paper.  Cam and Frasier are seated on the couch with their
    sherries, as Cam finishes writing on the tablet that was the source 
    of the yellow paper._]
    
        **Cam:** Fine.  I will arrange an introduction to my sweater weaver.
    **Frasier:** Good.  Thank you.
        **Cam:** But, then I must insist on the formula to your bath blend.
    
    [_Frasier looks concerned.  He pauses and takes a drink._]
    
    **Frasier:** I think we were closer on an earlier draft.
        **Cam:** Concur.
    
    [_They begin to straighten the crinkled pages, looking for the more
    promising earlier draft.  Fade out._]
    
    [_Scene 9 - Frasier's apartment.
    Martin, Cora, and Daphne are seated at the dining table drinking
    coffee.  Niles is still on his Segway, also drinking coffee._]
    
      **Niles:** Mmm.
     **Daphne:** Hey, Niles.  That Truffaut film you like is playing down
             at the La Salle.
      **Niles:** Oh.  Sounds tempting.  But the people behind me wouldn't be
             able to see.
     **Daphne:** I guess we'll stay in, then. [_gets up_] I'm going to go take a bath.
             It's too bad you have to stay on that. [_seductively_] I could
             use a third, and a fourth hand.  
    
    [_She cranes upward to give him a teasing kiss, then walks toward
    her room.  Niles spins around, following her with his eyes and  
    whining softly._]
    
      **Niles:** Uh... wait!  Daphne, Daphne, Daphne...  
    
    [_He parks the Segway and finally dismounts._]  
    
      **Niles:** There we go.  You wait there, I'll light the candles. 
    
    [_He runs off, passing Daphne, who waits for him to exit._]
    
     **Daphne:** So long, sucker!
    
    [_Martin and Cora laugh as she runs over and jumps onto the Segway._] 
    
      **Niles:**[_running back_] Daphne, what are you doing?
     **Daphne:** Whoo!  Hold the door! 
    
    [_She cruises to the door, where Cam and Frasier have just entered.  
    They make room for her._]
    
     **Daphne:** Whoo-hoo!  Whoa-hoh! 
      **Niles:**[_running after her, distressed_] Daphne!  Daphne...
    
    [_They exit, Niles in desperate pursuit.  Frasier and Cam exchange
    a look and close the door._]
    
     **Martin:** Hey, boys!
       **Cora:** Have you two been fighting?
    **Frasier:** On the contrary.  Cam and I are here to announce the cessation
             of all hostilities between us.  We are officially friends.
        **Cam:** As defined by the treaty. [_They shake hands._]
       **Cora:** Well, that means a lot to us.
        **Cam:** Oh, I think it's safe to say that we've entered a whole new era
             of coopera...
    
    [_He catches himself, noticing one of Frasier's knick-knacks._] 
    
        **Cam:** Did you get that at Mueller's Antiques?
    **Frasier:**[_excitedly_] Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did.  It
             represents a great triumph for me.  You see, I snatched it
             from under the nose of another collector who had actually 
             put a... [_catching himself as he notices Cam's glare_]
       **Cora:**[_rising and running to them_] You were saying, it's a new era
             of cooperation.  How wonderful.  You should celebrate.  The two 
             of you should go to the symphony tonight.
        **Cam:** But I thought you and I were going.
       **Cora:** I'm going to stay here with Martin.
    
    [_She goes back to sit at the dinner table._]
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose.
       **Cora:** Well, then you'd better hurry.  Cam likes to pre-order his
             intermission cocktail.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Then you don't have a standing order?  Well, we'd better
             hurry, then.  We'll take my car.
    
    [_Frasier rushes to the door._]
    
        **Cam:** I've seen you drive.  We'll take mine.
    **Frasier:** What, your Humvee?  I think not.
        **Cam:** Not in front of the parents, Crane.
    
    [_Frasier opens the door.  Daphne whizzes by on the Segway, with Niles
    in pursuit._]
    
     **Daphne:** Whoo-hoo!
      **Niles:** Darling, darling, darling!
    
    [_Frasier allows them to pass, and then ushers Cam out the door._]
    
     **Martin:** I can't believe they're going to spend the whole evening
             together.
       **Cora:** Oh, I know!  If they get through it alive, we should probably
             tell them the truth.
     
    [_They move to the door._]
    
     **Martin:** Too bad.  It was fun being your boyfriend for a few days.
    
    [_He opens the door._]
    
       **Cora:**[_laughing_] It was!  Still, all good things must come to 
             an end.
    
    [_Martin nods.  There is palpable romantic tension.  They lean to each
    other for an extended and tender kiss._]
    
       **Cora:** But who knows when?
    
    [_She smiles suggestively and exits.  Martin closes the door, beaming.
    Fade out._]
    
    _END OF ACT 2_
    
    [_Scene Z - End Credits.
    Frasier's lobby.  The whole sequence is in fast motion.  Daphne exits
    the elevator on the Segway.  Niles attempts to head her off.  They
    exit to the rear.  Niles now cruises back aboard the machine with
    Daphne in pursuit.  They go inside the elevator, which closes.  When
    it opens again, the Segway has been commandeered by Joe, the maintenance
    guy.  Daphne and Niles pursue him.  He exits to the rear with Daphne
    running after him.  Niles remains behind and kicks at the air in
    disappointment._]
