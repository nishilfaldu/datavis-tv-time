    **PREVIOUSLY ON FRASIER**
    _Scenes From "Mother Load, Part I"
    
    Niles and Daphne at the Montana:_
    
      **Niles:** You could live here.
     **Daphne:** Are you asking me?
      **Niles:** Would you like to?
     **Daphne:** Would you like me to?
      **Niles:** Yeah.
     **Daphne:** Then I will.
    _CUT TO:
    Frasier and Martin at home:_
    **Frasier:** I gave the greatest speech of my condo board career, which 
             led to a vote, which led to a ruling that Cam Winston must 
             now park that SUV monstrosity of his in the subbasement!
    [ ]
     **Martin:** Think that's smart, taking on the guy who lives right above 
             us?
    _CUT TO:
    Daphne coming out of her room:_
     **Daphne:** Well, the move's off.
      **Niles:** What?
     **Daphne:** Just temporarily.  My parents are coming for a visit.
    [ ]
      **Niles:** Just to clarify: you're going to stay here, but your parents 
             are going to stay with me?
     **Daphne:**[_hugs him_] Oh, I'm so glad you understand.
    _CUT TO: 
    Niles and Daphne in his kitchen:_
      **Niles:** If she thinks you're a virgin, how are you going to explain 
             our plan to live together?
     **Daphne:** I wonder how important it is that she ever finds out.
    _CUT TO: 
    The last scene:_
        **Simon:** Dad scarpered.
       **Daphne:** He left?
        **Simon:** Yeah.
    **Mrs. Moon:** It's true.  Thank goodness I have my children to lean upon.
        **Simon:** Oh, don't cry, Mum.  I really thought this junket to America 
               would cheer you up.
        **Niles:** It still can! [ ] Get out there and see the country.
      **Frasier:** Yes, immerse yourself in the spectacle and the grandeur 
               that are these United States, this... America.
    _As if on cue, a huge American flag falls from the above balcony, 
    completely covering Frasier's windows with the stars and stripes._
      **Niles:** How did you do that?
    [ ]
    **Frasier:** Cam Winston!
    _FADE TO:
    
    ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - The Montana
    Daphne is seated on the couch.  Niles brings a tray of food._
     **Daphne:** It was a good idea taking Mum out today, helped take her mind 
             off Dad.
      **Niles:** Yeah, although I'm not sure the zoo was the best idea.  
             The sight of those amorous wolverines seemed to set 
             her back a bit.
     **Daphne:** Amorous?  I thought they were trying to kill each other.
      **Niles:** Well, either way, it seemed to remind her of something.
    _Mrs. Moon comes out._
        **Niles:** Hello, Mrs. Moon.  Would you care for a bite to eat?
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh, that would be lovely - if I thought I could keep anything 
               down. [_sinks into a chair_] How could your father do this to 
               me?  You sleep down the hall from someone for forty years, 
               you think you know them!
       **Daphne:** I know you're upset, Mum, but it's not like you and Dad had 
               a perfect marriage.
    **Mrs. Moon:** That's because there's no such thing!  You young modern 
               people think marriage is some sort of promenade through 
               paradise, when it's more like a march through Hell with 
               a man strapped to your back and a litter of nasty babies 
               swinging from your teats!
       **Daphne:** Obviously, this is a very upsetting time for all of us.  
               But, remember, tomorrow is another day!
    **Mrs. Moon:** You're right, dear.  And the sooner you get home to bed, 
               the sooner it'll be here.
       **Daphne:** But it's only 9:30!
    **Mrs. Moon:** And with every tick of the clock, your womanly resistance 
               weakens, and before you know it he'll be on top of you like 
               one of those bloody badgers at the zoo.
        **Niles:** Actually, those were wolverines, and there's a chance they 
               may have been fighting.
       **Daphne:** It has been a long day.  Maybe it's best if I leave.
        **Niles:** All right.
       **Daphne:** I'll see you tomorrow, Mum. [_kisses her Mum and goes to 
               the door_] Goodnight, Niles.
        **Niles:** Goodnight.
    _They start to kiss, but Mrs. Moon turns to look at them, so they just 
    shake hands.  Daphne leaves.
    
    FADE OUT 
    
    Scene Two - Apartment
    Frasier is standing by the fireplace, staring at the flag covering 
    his windows.
    
    Martin comes out in his robe._
     **Martin:** Oh, hey.  You still up?
    **Frasier:** I can't sleep.  Every time I look outside, I feel like I'm 
             living inside a giant clown's pocket.  I tell you, Cam Winston 
             has not heard the last of this.  I am calling an emergency 
             meeting of the condo board tomorrow morning!
     **Martin:** You can't fight this, Frasier.  It'll just look like you're 
             attacking the flag.
    **Frasier:** I'm not attacking the flag, Cam is using the flag to attack me!
     **Martin:** You're right, but you're still going to lose.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but-but the building has bylaws about this sort of thing.  
             If this was anything but the American flag, people would demand 
             that it be taken down!
     **Martin:** Face it, Fras, Cam's got you on this one.  Boy, I have to say, 
             that guy is smart.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  Well, if he's so smart and you're so smart, 
             why don't you two live together?
     **Martin:** At least he's got a view.
    _The door opens, and Simon stumbles in with a bottle in one hand and 
    the other arm wrapped around a blowzy brunette.  They are both drunk._
      **Simon:** Hello!
    **Frasier:** What on earth do you think you're doing?!
      **Simon:** Oh, sorry, I-I didn't know you was here.  Uh, Frasier, this is 
             Loretta. [_she waves_] Loretta... well, you know who you are. 
             [_they laugh_]
    **Loretta:**[_sees the flag and gasps_] I love your curtains!
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, miss, but we are not entertaining guests this 
             evening.  You'll have to leave.
    **Loretta:**[_to Simon_] Wait, you told me this was your place!  You're 
             probably not even the Duke of England! [_exits_]
      **Simon:** Oh, yeah?  Then why do I talk this way?
    _Frasier shuts the door._
      **Simon:** Well, you're just a big contraceptive, aren't you? [_takes a 
             swig_]
    **Frasier:** I've just about had it with you, Simon. [_goes to the hall 
             and picks up Simon's duffel bag_] You have blown my speakers, 
             clogged my Jacuzzi, and you have ingested half of my bath 
             products! [_throws the duffel out the door_] You are no longer 
             welcome in my home.
      **Simon:** What exactly are you implying?
    **Frasier:** GET OUT! 
    _He throws Simon out._
     **Martin:** Fras, you can't throw him out, where's he gonna go?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he'll land on his feet.  Probably end up shacking up 
             with some two-bit floozy!
    _SMASH CUT TO: 
    
    Scene Three - Roz's Apartment
    Close-up of Simon tapping on someone's window.
    
    It's Roz's apartment.  She's been reading on her couch, when the noise 
    makes her jump._
        **Roz:** Simon! [_gets up and opens the door_] What are you doing here?
      **Simon:**[_stepping in_] Hello, love.  It appears that the front door to 
             the building is locked.
        **Roz:** Yeah, that's how we keep drunks from wandering in. [_pushes him 
             out_]
      **Simon:** Well, I seem to be without appropriate accommodation at the 
             moment, I just thought I'd take you up on your kind and 
             generous offer-
        **Roz:** I never said you could stay here!
      **Simon:** But Frasier's thrown me out!
        **Roz:** Sleep in Martin's Winnebago.
      **Simon:** Well, wouldn't I love to do that.  But when I got down there, 
             there was this gigantic Humvee blocking the door.
        **Roz:** Simon, this isn't my problem.  You have got to go.
    _Simon puts down his duffel and adopts a new tone, one we've never 
    heard before - gentle and earnest._
      **Simon:** Look, Roz, I'll level with you.  I know that we've had a 
             checkered history, and I'm probably not the sort of person 
             that you want in your house.  But I'm asking for your help.  
             As a friend, as Daphne's brother, please just let me stay 
             one night.  You won't even notice me.  Just the tiniest spot 
             on the floor would be a gift.  Look, I'll be gone in the 
             morning, I'll never darken your doorstep again.  Please, Roz, 
             I've got nowhere else to go.
        **Roz:**...All right.  I'll make up the couch for you.
      **Simon:** Oh, thank you, Roz.  You have got a good heart.
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    _He goes back onto the balcony and yells down:_
      **Simon:**[_boorish again_] Climb on up, Susie!  We're golden! [_laughs_] 
             She can swing on a pole for two hours, but she can't climb 
             up a drainpipe to save her life!
    _Roz picks up his duffel and heaves it over the balcony._
      **Simon:** Oi, what-? [_yells down_] Heads up, Susie!
    _Then she shuts the window, locking him outside.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - The Montana
    Mrs. Moon is smoking and playing poker with Niles._
        **Niles:** Two, please. [_she deals him two_] Thank you... ha-ha!
    **Mrs. Moon:** Well, show us what you got.
        **Niles:** I've got a king, a jack, a 10, and two 6's.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Two sixes, then.
        **Niles:** And-and a king.
    **Mrs. Moon:** I'm sorry, love.  I've got aces over deuces.
        **Niles:** Well, that's, uh, that's the last of my mad money.  I guess 
               I'll have to win it back some other night.
    **Mrs. Moon:** You'd better make it soon, I won't be around much longer.
        **Niles:** Not if you keep biting those filters off, you won't.
    **Mrs. Moon:** No, I mean I'll be going back to England soon.  Well, it's 
               nice enough here, but you and Daphne aren't the most 
               exciting people, are you? [_Niles shakes his head_] No, 
               as soon as I've sorted myself out, Simon and I are back 
               on the plane.
        **Niles:** Really, you are?  Uh, can I do anything to help sort?
    **Mrs. Moon:** Thank you, no.  Oh, the shock's worn off, really.  I've 
               come to realize I've spent most of my life taking care 
               of a layabout husband.  Well, now it's my turn to be taken 
               care of.  Thank God I've got Simon.
    _Niles, despite his wish to see her gone, is alarmed at this._
        **Niles:** Simon's going to be taking care of you?
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh, well of course he will!  I know he plays the fool 
               sometimes, but he'd never let me down.
        **Niles:** Well, you've made a lot of progress in a short amount of 
               time, so I can't tell you how happy I am.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh... you good for a few more hands?
        **Niles:** Why not?  Oh!  I'm out of money.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh, not to worry.  We can play for rubs. [_props up her feet_]
        **Niles:** Oh!  I'll get my coin collection.
    _He leaves the room.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - Frasier's Apartment
    Frasier is sitting on the couch, staring at the flag and blowing a
    soft note on the lips of Simon's bottle.  
    
    Daphne comes out in her pajamas._
     **Daphne:** Still awake, Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  It's almost dawn's early light, and our flag is still 
             there. [_gets an idea_] Daphne!  As a subject of the British 
             realm, does it make you feel uncomfortable to have your 
             residence draped in the American flag?  And if so, would you 
             be willing to say that at a condo board meeting?
     **Daphne:** Personally, I find it a cozy reminder of the land I dreamed 
             of living in as a child.
    **Frasier:**[_defeated_] Off I go.
    _He trudges off to bed.  Daphne goes to the kitchen.  
    Simon slips in the front door and follows her._
     **Daphne:** Simon!  I thought Dr. Crane kicked you out.
      **Simon:** He did, you don't see me.
     **Daphne:** What are you doing here?
      **Simon:** Well, I'm just getting some provisions for my trip.
    _He removes a six-pack, a large salami and assorted other items from 
    the fridge._
     **Daphne:** What trip?
      **Simon:** Well, I just thought I'd go meet some mates in California.
     **Daphne:** You can't run out on Mum, she's counting on you!
      **Simon:** She's got the other boys back home.
     **Daphne:** They've all sided with Dad, you know that.  You're all she's 
             got.
      **Simon:** I'm not cut out to take care of Mum, she's too demanding.  
             She turned Dad into a shiftless drinker.  I can't have her 
             doing that to me! [_goes to the door_]
     **Daphne:** So you're just going to leave in the middle of the night and 
             not even tell her?
      **Simon:** Look, Stilts, if you want to take care of Mum, that's your 
             choice, but I've got to live my life.
     **Daphne:** You are so selfish!  For once in your life you have a chance 
             to be responsible, be a man and do right by your family!  
             Why don't you think about that before you go flitting off 
             to California?
      **Simon:** Well, I'm sorry, Daphne.  Maybe it makes me a bad person, 
             but I don't have it in me.  It's not who I am.  I'll see you.
    _He exits, leaving her alone.  She closes the door and thinks.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Six - The Montana
    That same night, someone is knocking softly but urgently on the door.  
    Niles checks the spyhole and opens it to Daphne, still in her pajamas._
      **Niles:**[_whispering_] Wait, wait, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Don't wake 
             your mother, I just got her down. [_she comes in_] What are 
             you doing here?
     **Daphne:** Something terrible has happened.  Simon's left.
      **Niles:** What do you mean, left?
     **Daphne:** He's gone.  He's left me to take care of Mum.  I don't know 
             what I'm going to do, but I may have to go back to Manchester 
             with her for a while.
      **Niles:** No, no, no, you can't do that.  You have a life here.
     **Daphne:** Well, what am I supposed to do?  I can't have her stay at 
             Dr. Crane's, there's no room.
      **Niles:** Well, you can both live here.
     **Daphne:** Oh, Niles, you know she'll never go for that arrangement.
    _Mrs. Moon comes out._
    **Mrs. Moon:** A bit late at night for a single lady to be in a man's home, 
               isn't it?
       **Daphne:** I'm here because Simon's left, off to California to do God 
               knows what.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh... well, but that's courageous!  Good to see him 
               finally taking charge of his life.
       **Daphne:** He's not taking charge, he left because he doesn't want to 
               take care of you.
    **Mrs. Moon:** That is not so!  Simon is a special boy, he wasn't meant to 
               be kept at home.  He has dreams.  You wouldn't understand 
               that!
    _Daphne explodes._
       **Daphne:** Now you listen to me, Mum!  In case you haven't noticed, 
               I've got dreams too!  I even moved halfway across the 
               world to make a life for myself!  Do you admire that?  
               No, you don't even acknowledge it!  Oh, and by the way, 
               I'm no virgin!  Haven't been for years!  You remember 
               that boy with the lazy eye you hated so much?  Yeah, he 
               was my first!  Did it right in the parlor where you take 
               your tea!  Then there was the German who fixed Dad's car!  
               Oh yeah, and that Irish chap I fancied, who was twice my
               age and had his own van and a band!  Then I came to America, 
               shall I go on?!
    _Niles, who looks as unsettled as Mrs. Moon, shakes his head._
     **Daphne:** Well, I am a grown woman who's made her own life and her own 
             decisions! [_takes Niles' hand_] Now, I plan to shack up with 
             Niles here, and damned if we aren't going to do it every 
             night of the week!
    _Now Niles' expression is a masterwork by David Hyde Pierce: 
    a tight grin that shows mortified embarrassment fighting against 
    unrestrained glee._
    [__N.B. A much similar expression can be found in[[7.09]](/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_9/the_apparent_trap.html "The Apparent Trap") The Apparent Trap__]
    
       **Daphne:** That's the way it's gonna be, Mum, and if you don't like it, 
               that's just tough!
    **Mrs. Moon:** Is that so?  Well, if that's how you repay me for all my 
               sacrifices-
       **Daphne:** Oh, don't even start!
    **Mrs. Moon:** Fine!  Just for that, I'm not spending another night under 
               this roof.  I intend to fetch my things, find a hotel, and 
               be on the first flight home tomorrow!  Excuse me!
    _She storms out of the room.  Niles and Daphne sit on the couch._
     **Daphne:** Oh God, look at me, I'm shaking!  It just came gushing out, 
             once I started I couldn't stop!
      **Niles:** I know, it's all right, it's all right.  You were great, you 
             were great, I have never been prouder of you.
     **Daphne:** I can't believe I talked to my mother that way. [_laughs_]
      **Niles:** You must have been pretty outraged to have invented all those 
             former lovers. [_chuckles nervously_]
     **Daphne:** What?
      **Niles:**[_helping her along_] All those former lovers...
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes, right, of course!  I'm actually surprised she's 
             leaving so easily.  I thought she'd milk it a bit more.
    _Mrs. Moon comes back in behind Niles and Daphne._
    **Mrs. Moon:** Just so you know - I won't be needing a lift to the hotel.  
               I shall call a taxi.
       **Daphne:**[_not turning around_] Whatever you want.
    **Mrs. Moon:** You'll see.  I don't need any of you rotten ingrates, I can 
               take perfectly good care of myself!
       **Daphne:** Glad to hear it.
    _Mrs. Moon pauses, then quite obviously squats on the floor._
    **Mrs. Moon:** Ow!
    _As they turn around and run over, she moans and clutches her knee._
       **Daphne:** Oh God, what happened?
        **Niles:** Are you hurt?
    **Mrs. Moon:** Well, of course I'm hurt! [_they help her to a chair_]
               Oh, get me ice-
        **Niles:** All right, all right.
    **Mrs. Moon:** And whiskey!
        **Niles:** O.K.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Not cheap stuff!  Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna fly now, 
               the pain is unbearable!  Though I know I'm not welcome here.  
               Oh, I can't say I blame you.  No sense burdening yourself 
               with an old woman... who can't take care of herself... 
               and has nowhere else to go...
        **Niles:**[_forcing out the words_] Oh, don't be silly.  You can stay 
               here as long as you like.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Well, move along, the whiskey's not pouring itself.
    _Niles goes to the kitchen.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **NOT ONE OF THEM 
    KNOWS THE SECOND VERSE**
    _Scene Seven - Building Common Room
    Frasier is addressing the condo board (Mr. Williams, Mrs. Richman, 
    and another woman) and the assembled tenants._
     **Frasier:** Are we fiercely patriotic?  Yes.  But how do we best 
              demonstrate that?  Not by infringing on the rights and 
              balconies of others, but as most good Americans do, 
              in our hearts, with generous spirit and quiet reverence.  
              I respectfully submit that when we display the flag as 
              Mr. Winston has, it flies in the face of the very freedoms
              for which it stands.  Thank you. [_sits down_]
    **Williams:** Cam, rebuttal?
    _Cam rises from his seat in the rear._
    [
    
    > "Patriotism,_n. Combustible rubbish ready to the torch of 
>     any one ambitious to illuminate his name.
>       In Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary patriotism is defined

     - Ambrose Bierce_]
    
         **Cam:** The last thing I wanted was to create conflict.  I was 
              merely trying to boost the morale of the community.
     **Richman:** And so you have. [_the tenants murmur agreement_]
    **Williams:** I move that the flag stays. [_agreement again_]
     **Frasier:** All right, all right, ver-ver-very well, then.  B-but 
              perhaps... perhaps we could display it on the north 
              side of the building, for the benefit of our Canadian 
              neighbors.
         **Cam:** That was my first instinct, but it can't be illuminated 
              at night from that side.
     **Richman:** Lighting is a must.
    **Williams:** Absolutely.
     **Richman:** Then it's settled. [_pounds gavel_]
     **Frasier:** All right, just-just hold on a second!  I feel I'm being 
              hoodwinked.  The only reason Cam hung that flag was to get 
              the better of me.  He knows I bought the apartment for its 
              view!
         **Cam:** No, you bought that apartment because you're free! 
              [_agreement again_]
      **Albert:** Maybe you could have a view from your balcony in _Iraq!_
     **Richman:** Yes, move to Iraq!
    _The tenants take up the chant, "Move to Iraq!"_
     **Frasier:** No, wait, wait, wait!  I am just as much an American as 
              every one of you!  Perhaps Cam would just tell us how 
              long he intends to display our beautiful flag?
         **Cam:** Hmm, how about until there's world peace?
      **Albert:** Oh, that's a good idea! [_agreement again_]
     **Frasier:** Oh, come on!  There's never going to be world peace! 
              [_boos and hisses_]
    **Williams:** Maybe there would be world peace if there were more people 
              like Cam and fewer people like you.
     **Frasier:** Oh now, just a second-
         **Cam:**[_singing_] Oh beautiful, for spacious skies...
    _Everyone but Frasier joins in, rising out of their seats._
    **All but Frasier:**    For amber waves of grain,
                        For purple mountains' majesty,
                        Above the fruited plain...
                        America, America...
    _Frasier, knowing when he's beaten, takes Cam aside as the others 
    continue singing._
    **Frasier:** All right, what do you want?
        **Cam:** Your parking spot.
    **Frasier:** You'll make all this stop?
        **Cam:** Well, there is the matter of the flag.  I can't just take it 
             down now.
    **Frasier:** All right, suggest the roof!  I'll even spring for the 
             flagpole.
    _They shake hands.  As they finish the chorus, Cam walks to the front._
        **Cam:** Everyone, everyone, everyone! [_they fall silent and sit_]  
             The America we love is one of good neighbors.  In order 
             to foster that, I have decided to move my flag to the roof.
    _The tenants murmur, "I don't know," "it's nice as it is," etc._
         **Cam:** This will not only serve to mend fences, but it will provide 
              all of Seattle with a view of our precious Stars and Stripes.
    **Williams:** You've done it again, Cam.
     **Richman:** He certainly has.
     **Frasier:** And, in the spirit of reciprocity, I will provide the 
              flagpole. [_no response_] And any necessary lighting.
      **Albert:** Credit grabber!
     **Frasier:** Oh, come on, we're all in agreement here! [_singing_] 
              "Oh beautiful, for spacious skies..." [_no one joins in_] 
              Come on, everybody!  "For amber waves of grain..."
    _The board members shuffle their papers impatiently as Cam gives 
    a triumphant smile._
    **Frasier:**[_gives up_] Oh, all right, I'll see you next week.
    _Frasier leaves._
    [_N.B. In addition to adding his voice (along with the rest of the 
    Frasier cast) to the general encouragement of America's troops and 
    citizens, Kelsey Grammer was a leading host of the huge joint-network 
    television special honoring firefighters and other rescue workers 
    fallen in New York._]
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Eight - The Montana
    Niles opens the door to Daphne and Mrs. Moon._
        **Niles:** How did things go at the doctor?
       **Daphne:** Couldn't find anything wrong with the knee - big surprise.
    **Mrs. Moon:**[_holds up pill bottle_] Then why did he give me sedatives, 
               smarty?
       **Daphne:** Because I begged him.
    **Mrs. Moon:** Oh, fetch me my water.
        **Niles:** Oh, I'll get it.
       **Daphne:**[_follows him_] I know how she likes it.
        **Niles:** Oh, but I know where the glasses are.
    _They both trot into the kitchen._
       **Daphne:** I am so sorry about this.
        **Niles:** It's all right, we'll manage.  I can live with anything -
               as long as I can live with you.
    **Mrs. Moon:**[_o.s._] I'm still waiting out here!
    _Daphne sticks her head out._
       **Daphne:** It's coming!  Pipe down!
    **Mrs. Moon:** Why?  Am I interrupting your dirty sex?
    _Daphne grits her teeth and comes back inside._
       **Daphne:** It's going to be interesting, the three of us living 
               together.
        **Niles:** Daphne, this is stupid.  We should just wait until she's 
               gone.
       **Daphne:** No, I said I was moving in, and I'm going to.
        **Niles:** It took you your whole life to assert your independence 
               from this woman.  I can't ask you to live under the same 
               roof with her.
       **Daphne:** Well, I can't ask you to live with her either.
        **Niles:**[_pouring the water_] Oh well, it's just temporary.  And you 
               know what?  She bothers you a lot more than she bothers me.
    **Mrs. Moon:**[_o.s._] Don't empty the sink, I'm soaking my smalls!
    _They both look away from the sink._
        **Niles:** Well, [_clears throat_] we've waited this long...
       **Daphne:** I love you, Niles.
        **Niles:** I love you too. [_they kiss and hug_]
       **Daphne:** And I promise, as soon as she's on a plane for England, 
               I'm here!
    _They go out._
        **Niles:** Mrs. Moon, did the doctor mention anything about when 
               you'd be able to fly?
    **Mrs. Moon:** No, didn't say a word about flying.  That's probably a 
               bad sign, eh?
        **Niles:** Yeah...
    _He slumps into a chair and lets his body go limp, resigned to a long 
    wait.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles rolls up his sleeves, puts on heavy rubber gloves, and takes 
    a deep breath before using a pair of tongs to remove Mrs. Moon's 
    underclothes from his sink and into a plastic bowl.
