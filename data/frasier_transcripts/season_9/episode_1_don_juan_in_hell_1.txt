## Bring On The Girls!

    
    
    [_with apologies to Mr. Wodehouse_]
    _"Listen, I know how bleak things can look when you're going through
    a dry spell, but they always end sooner or later.  I remember once in
    Boston feeling exactly the way you do now - and the very next week, I
    met a lovely barmaid.  Sophisticated, if a bit loquacious.  We fell 
    madly in love, we got engaged... Of course, she left me standing at 
    the altar - but the point is, I didn't give up.  I took my poor, 
    battered heart and offered it to Lilith... who put it in her little 
    cuisinart and hit the puree button.  But I rebounded!  And look how 
    far I've come... I'm divorced, lonely, and living with my father - 
    who cares less about me than he does about his foul-breathed flea 
    resort of a dog."_ 
    - Frasier, consoling Daphne about her love life
    
    And so it has been for eight years - though not for lack of variety:
    
    _**Hester Crane** (Rita Wilson)_
    Frasier's deceased mother, also a psychiatrist.  He once dated a 
    woman, Mia Preston, who looked exactly like her (Wilson again).

    _N.B. Nanny appeared once on_ Cheers _, played by Emma Thompson._
    
    _**Diane Chambers** (Shelley Long)_
    _"She's a one-time Boston barmaid who had a nervous breakdown and 
    ended up in a sanitorium, where I met her, fell for her, and then 
    was so mercilessly rejected by her that to this day there is a 
    sucking chest wound where once there dwelled a heart!"_

## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    [_N.B. The title of this episode is based on a title card from Episode 
    5.19, "Frasier Gotta Have It"_]
    _PROLOGUE_
    
    **PREVIOUSLY ON FRASIER**
    
    _Scenes From "Cranes Go Caribbean"
    
    Claire and Frasier in their hotel room:_
    
     **Claire:** I'm crazy about you.  I just started to feel like you didn't 
             want to be here with me.
    **Frasier:** Oh gosh, nothing could be further from the truth.
    
    _They hug.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Frasier and Claire in bed together:_
    
    **Frasier:** I'll tell you something else.  I'm happy.
    
    _He rolls over in bed.  The woman next to him rolls over - 
    it is now Lana._
    
    **Lana:** I'm glad, Frasier.  I'm happy, too.
    
    _They kiss and embrace.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Frasier on the phone in the hotel lobby:_
    
    **Frasier:** I'm on vacation with my girlfriend, Claire - a woman who, by 
             all conventional measures, is "perfect" for me.  And yet 
             I've just had a vivid, sexual dream about someone who 
             differs from her entirely. [ ] It's a woman named Lana...
    _FADE TO:
    
    ACT ONE_
    **HELL ON WHEELS**
    _Scene One - Frasier's BMW
    Frasier is driving along a country road.  Seated beside and in back 
    of him, respectively, are Lilith and Diane._
      **Diane:** Excuse me, but why do I have to sit in the back seat?  
             Seriously, my legs are starting to cramp back here-
     **Lilith:** Seriously, why is she here at all?
      **Diane:** I have just as much right to be here as you!
     **Lilith:** "Here" doesn't mean the front seat!
    **Frasier:** All right, listen, ladies, we've got about an hour to go.  
             I would like to have a little quiet, I'm going to turn on 
             some music.
    
    _Frasier turns on an opera station.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **ONE WEEK EARLIER 
    IN BELIZE**
    _Scene Two - Hotel Restaurant
    Martin, Daphne, and Claire are eating brunch together.
    
    Niles joins them.  He is now sporting a bushy goatee._  
    
    [_N.B. Odd, in light of Niles's past comic attempts to grow a mustache.  
    See[[4.22]](/frasier/transcripts/season_4/episode_22/are_you_being_served.html "Are You Being Served?"), "Are You Being Served?" and [[6.20]](/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_20/dr_nora.html "Dr. Nora"), "Dr. Nora."_]
    
      **Niles:** Morning, gang. [_they all ad-lib hellos_]
     **Daphne:** How's my natural man?
      **Niles:** Mmm, as hungry as I am hairy. [_kisses her_]
     **Claire:** No kidding, that goatee sure came in fast.
      **Niles:** I know.  I credit the hothouse atmosphere of this tropical 
             paradise -- that and our nearly constant nudity. [_Daphne 
             chuckles_] Gone is the citified dandy of just last week.  
             In his place stands a feral Caliban, a sandy-bottomed 
             Dionysius, a lusty, insatiable - ooh, scones!
    _He takes one.  A waiter brings a plate of pancakes for Claire._
     **Waiter:** Here is your special order.
     **Claire:** Thank you.
     **Martin:** I'm starving.  Claire and I have been up fishing since 5 A.M.
     **Daphne:** You've already got more fish than we could eat in a year.
     **Martin:** Well, we didn't just fish!  We went for a swim, we explored 
             some caves, and watched a school of dolphins-
     **Claire:** But the best part was when he taught me how to hypnotize a 
             lobster.
     **Daphne:** You what?
     **Martin:** It's all in the eyes.
    _He stares wide-eyed at Claire, then they both laugh._
     **Claire:** Hey, Marty, try this. [_offers a bite of pancake_]
     **Martin:**[_eats it_] Mmm, not bad!  Hey Niles, try this pancake!  Claire 
             had them crumble the bacon right into the batter.
      **Niles:** Oh, I don't really like pancakes.
     **Martin:** Well, that's 'cause you're used to Daphne's.  Here.
    _Daphne looks wounded as Niles eats a bite._
      **Niles:** Oh, those are magnificent!
     **Martin:** Yeah!  And Claire invented them!
     **Daphne:** Yes, no doubt on the seventh day while You were resting. 
             [_laughs_]
    _Frasier joins them._
    **Frasier:** Good morning, all. [_everyone greets him_]
     **Claire:** Hello, my sweet darling man.
    **Frasier:**[_kisses her_] Hello... kiddo.
     **Daphne:** So, have they found your luggage yet, Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** If they had, would I be wearing this shirt three days in a 
             row?  Huh, fat chance.  
    _A photographer comes over._
    **Photographer:** Souvenir of your stay?
          **Martin:** Oh, sure!  
         **Frasier:** By all means.
          **Martin:** Yeah, this is a brunch to remember.
           **Niles:** It's not a vacation until Dad takes a picture of one of 
                  his meals.
    _They pose on one side of the table - Daphne with her arm around Niles, 
    Martin with his arm around Claire, Frasier hunching over them all.  
    The photographer takes the picture._
         **Frasier:** Very good!  Thank you very much, well done. [_tips him_]
    **Photographer:** You can pick them up at the front desk.
         **Frasier:** Thank you.
          **Claire:**[_gets up_] Well, sorry to run off, but I have to finish 
                  packing.
         **Frasier:** Right.
          **Claire:** I'll see you up at the room.
         **Frasier:** OK.
    _They kiss, and Claire leaves.  Everyone ad-libs goodbyes.  
    Frasier sits down._
          **Martin:** Oh, she's a real find, Fras.
         **Frasier:** Yes, she is, isn't she? [_waves the photographer back_] 
                  Oh, excuse me?
    **Photographer:** Yes?
         **Frasier:** Do you think we could have another picture, of just the 
                  family?
    **Photographer:** No problem.
         **Frasier:** Thank you.
          **Martin:** Well, what about Claire?  She's practically family.
         **Frasier:** Oh, very much so, but there may come a time when... 
                  say, she isn't.
    _They pose as before (minus Claire), and the photographer takes the 
    picture._
    **Frasier:** Thank you again.
     **Martin:**[_checks his watch_] Oh, hey!  We better get going, Daph.  
             We got fish to pack! [_he and Daphne get up_] Oh, and I didn't 
             fillet 'em, because Claire said you can use the heads for 
             soup!
     **Daphne:** Well, when I'm chopping them off, I'll be thinking of her.
    _They leave.  Frasier sits next to Niles._
    **Frasier:** Niles, listen, I didn't want to say anything in front of the 
             others, but I find myself in a bit of a quandary.  Well, 
             it's not so much a quandary, really, it's more of, uh, a 
             pickle.  Well, not so much a pickle, but well, but, no more 
             than a, a... a cornichon.
      **Niles:** What is it?
    **Frasier:** I think I want to be with Lana, not Claire.
      **Niles:** Forgive me, Frasier, but that's one big-ass cornichon.
    **Frasier:** I know, I know.  I'm having a perfectly wonderful time with 
             Claire, it's just that my mind keeps drifting back to Lana.
      **Niles:** For God's sake, why?  She's loud, she's crass-
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, but she's also challenging, and sexy, and exciting.  
             I'm just afraid I may have let go of that too hastily.
      **Niles:** Frasier, you do this every time.  You are in a great 
             relationship with Claire.  Don't overthink it.  Embrace it.
    **Frasier:** You're right, Niles.  Thank you.  Yes, I should just go with 
             it.  Gosh, I don't know what's wrong with me.  I don't know 
             why I keep insisting on overanalyzing everything.
    _SMASH CUT TO: Close-Up of Martin._
     **Martin:**[_whispering_] Because you're crazy, that's why!
    _They are on the plane returning to Seattle.  Frasier is sitting 
    across from Martin, Claire is asleep in the seat next to him.  
    Martin leans back to allow a woman to walk down the aisle, then 
    leans forward again._
     **Martin:** Claire's perfect for you, but I like her too!  How many 
             times does that happen?
    **Frasier:** But what about Lana?
     **Martin:** Oh, forget Lana!  Stay with Claire. [_stares at Frasier, 
             chanting_] Stay-with-Claire.  Stay-with-Claire.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I am not a lobster.  Of course I'm going to stay with 
             Claire.  I was just going through some momentary doubts, 
             and I needed your guidance.
     **Martin:** Well, glad you got what you needed.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  I feel completely at ease now.  No more doubts, 
             no more nagging questions.  I'm just being a little overly 
             cautious, that's all.
    _SMASH CUT TO: C.U. of Daphne._
     **Daphne:** Who could blame you?
    _She and Frasier are standing by the bathroom at the rear of the plane._
     **Daphne:** I'm not sure about Claire either.  God knows she has quite 
             the fan club around here, but I think you can do much better.  
             You'll know when you meet the right person.  You feel it in 
             your gut.
    _Behind her, Niles rushes into the bathroom with a hand over his mouth._
    **Frasier:** It's true.  But you see, I don't want to feel like I'm 
             leading her on.  Maybe I should just tell her what I'm 
             going through.  You know, be completely honest.
    _SMASH CUT TO: C.U. of an Airport Maintenance Guy._
        **Guy:** Whoa, that's just what you don't want to do.
    _The plane is now on the ground and empty, except for Frasier and the 
    Maintenance Guy._
    **Frasier:** So, you vote for Claire?
        **Guy:** I don't know.  Lana has her good points.  And don't 
             underestimate the crush you had on her in 11th grade.  
             But Claire can give you sophisticated conversation.  
             And she leaves a clean area!
    _He motions to Claire's seat, where the pillow and blanket are neatly 
    folded._
        **Guy:** I don't envy you your choice.  Lift your feet, please.
    _Frasier does, allowing the Maintenance Guy to vacuum the floor under them.
    
    FADE TO: 
    
    Scene Two - Cafe Nervosa
    Roz is reading at a table.  Niles, wearing shorts, a tropical shirt, 
    and his beard, gets his coffee from the counter._
      **Niles:** Excuse me, miss, do you have the time?
        **Roz:**[_glances up, then checks her watch_] Yes, it's- [_double-take_] 
             Niles?
      **Niles:**[_Jamaican accent_] Ya, mon!
        **Roz:** You look... did you get hit on the head by a coconut?
      **Niles:** The coconut of revelation.  I discovered a whole new side of 
             myself in Belize, and I'm not going to abandon Island Niles 
             just 'cause my vacation's over.
        **Roz:** Well, Island Niles might want to rethink the short pants.
      **Niles:** Island Niles would prefer not to wear pants at all.  You 
             should have seen us, Roz - out in the elements, nothing on 
             our bodies but sunblock 120.  It was exhilarating and primal, 
             and... frankly, it's disappointing to have to strap myself 
             back into these fabric shackles.
        **Roz:** So you're going to be spending your time at the nude beach  
             now?
      **Niles:** Seattle has a nude beach?
        **Roz:** Well, not officially, but just south of Alki, there's this 
             little strip near the White House.  
      **Niles:** Thanks for the tip, Roz.
        **Roz:** Here's another one: don't go on Thursdays, it's Senior 
             Volleyball Day.
    _Frasier comes in._
    **Frasier:** Oh well, Roz, I see you've met Island Niles.  At least he 
             did you the courtesy of putting a shirt on.
      **Niles:**[_proudly_] I'm still not wearing underpants.
    _Niles makes the "Hang Loose" sign at Roz and leaves._
    **Frasier:**[_to the counter person_] May I have a latte, please? [_sits 
             down_] Well, Roz, you'll be pleased to know I have come to 
             a decision: Claire it is; So long, Lana!
        **Roz:** Are you sure?
    **Frasier:** Trust me, Roz.  The brain is racked, the soul is searched, 
             the window is closed.  Claire in, Lana out.
        **Roz:** I'm glad to hear it.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    _Lana and Kirby come into the Cafe._
       **Lana:** Hey, Roz.  Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Lana, uh, hi, uh... hello.
       **Lana:** Wow, you look great.
    **Frasier:** Not as great as you do.  I mean, thanks.
      **Kirby:** Hey, Roz.
        **Roz:** Kirby.
      **Kirby:** It's been too long.
        **Roz:** No, it hasn't.
      **Kirby:** Or has it?
        **Roz:** No.
    **Frasier:** So, what brings you here?
       **Lana:** Well, actually we just picked up the invitations for Kirby's 
             graduation party.
    **Frasier:** Oh!
       **Lana:** Roz, you're invited too.  After all, you motivated Kirby to 
             study.
        **Roz:** Well, no, Frasier was the one who helped him.  I was just 
             his last-minute prom date.
      **Kirby:** You were the prize that I kept my eyes on!  And, uh, for 
             your FYI, I'm cool for hanging out, just as platatonic 
             friends, or whatever.
       **Lana:** Um, Kirby, we should go if we're gonna pick up your inhaler.
      **Kirby:** Thanks a lot, Mom! [_to Roz_] I only need it in the fall.
       **Lana:** Well, we'll see you at the party.
    **Frasier:** Right.
       **Lana:** Hey, Frasier, don't you be a stranger.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, I-I won't.  Uh, don't you be a stranger, either.  
             To me.
    _Lana looks confused, but she laughs it off.  She and Kirby leave._
        **Roz:** Let me guess: Lana in, Claire out.
    **Frasier:** What, that?  Oh, that was nothing.  It's just, she merely 
             caught me off guard.  Don't go reading anything into that.
        **Roz:** OK, if you say so. [_gets up_] Listen, Frasier, I got to go.
    **Frasier:** Oh, alright.
        **Roz:** But let not... either us... be strangers... be.
    _She touches his shoulder flirtatiously and leaves.  Frasier chafes.

    Scene Three - Airport Storage Room
    Frasier is standing at the counter.  A luggage clerk hauls in a large 
    bag._
      **Clerk:** Oh, I apologize for the inconvenience, but, uh, at least 
             there's a happy ending, right?
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] My suitcase is inside this to keep it safe?
      **Clerk:** So...
    **Frasier:** That is not my bag.
      **Clerk:** Right.  I'll keep looking.
    _He disappears to the back again.  Another customer comes in._
        **Man:** Have you been waiting here long?
    **Frasier:** Time is irrelevant here in the Seventh Circle of Hell -- 
             a place where even despair dies.  Prepare yourself for a 
             lifetime...
        **Man:** Oh, here it is!
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, how nice for you.
    _The man picks up one of two suitcases sitting by the counter.  
    He turns to go, but stops._
        **Man:** Hey, you're Dr. Frasier Crane, aren't you?  I'm a big fan!
    **Frasier:**[_shakes his hand_] Oh, it's always nice to meet a fan.
        **Man:** Yeah, thanks.  Hey, do you give advice, you know, off the 
             clock?
    **Frasier:** Well, this isn't really a good time.
        **Man:** Well, because I've really gotten my life into a tangle.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.
        **Man:** No, but, you see, I'm torn between these two women!
    **Frasier:** I'm listening.
        **Man:** I'm with this woman, her name's Kathy, she's great.  But the 
             only problem is, I can't stop thinking about my ex.  I mean, 
             she was a real handful, but now that we're apart, I just 
             miss her like crazy.
    **Frasier:** Of course you do!  And no matter how hard you try to focus 
             on this new relationship, your mind keeps drifting back to 
             her.
        **Man:** Exactly!  I mean, I even have these, um...
    **Frasier:** Dreams!
        **Man:** Yes!  Wow, you're good.  What should I do?
    **Frasier:** Well, what are you thinking of doing?
        **Man:** Classic shrink response.  Um, I'm thinking... do I really 
             want to break things off with this woman?
    **Frasier:** Who you thought was so perfect for you.
        **Man:** OK, but how perfect could she be if I'm obsessing about 
             another woman?
    **Frasier:** That's the conundrum!
        **Man:** I know, but am I sure enough to break her heart?
    **Frasier:** Especially when the rest of the family just loved her.
        **Man:** Yeah- no, they don't.
    **Frasier:** Alright, stick with me, stick with me.  It all boils down to 
             this: which of these two women do you see spending the rest 
             of your life with?
        **Man:** Right.  Right, of course.  Well, I think it's pretty obvious 
             what I have to do.  What a relief!  Thanks, Doc. 
             [_starts to leave_]
    **Frasier:** Wait, wait!  Let's go back!  Just so I'm sure you're sure-
        **Man:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Who are you picking?
        **Man:** My ex!  I mean, if I'm really honest with myself, she's the 
             one I love.  As long as I stay with Kathy, I'm just being a 
             jerk.
    **Frasier:** No, well, to be fair, you have struggled with these issues.
        **Man:** No, I've really just been trying to have my cake and eat it 
             too. [_shakes his hand_] Thanks, Dr. Crane.  I know what I 
             have to do now.
    _The Man leaves.  Frasier seems to have made his decision.

    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four - Apartment
    Martin is finishing a sandwich in his Armchair.  Daphne comes in the 
    door with the groceries._
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry I'm a little late, I'll start your lunch right away.
     **Martin:** Oh, no need.  Claire made the best deviled ham sandwich in 
             the history of deviling.
     **Daphne:** Oh, too bad.  I missed her.
     **Martin:** Mm, more good news!  She's still here.
    _Claire comes out of the kitchen with another sandwich._
     **Claire:** Here you go, Marty.
     **Martin:** Oh, thanks, toots.
     **Daphne:** Claire!  I can't imagine you came all the way over here just 
             to make sandwiches.
     **Claire:** Oh, no.  Here, let me take those. [_takes the groceries_] 
             I'm making fish jerky. [_heads back to the kitchen, but stops_] 
             You know the secret to making fish jerky, don't you, Marty?
     **Martin:** No idea.
     **Claire:** Feed 'em coffee.
     **Martin:** Feed 'em...? [_laughs uproariously, Claire laughs with him_] 
             That's terrific!  You hear that, Daph?
     **Daphne:** I'm standing right here.
     **Martin:** Don't you love her laugh?  It's like music.
     **Claire:** Marty, you are just the sweetest! [_goes to the kitchen_]
     **Daphne:** You used to think my accent sounded musical, didn't you... 
             Marty?
     **Martin:** Yeah, but now I'm used to it.
    _Niles comes in the front - clean-shaven, wearing his traditional suit._
      **Niles:** Afternoon, Daphne, Dad.
     **Martin:** Niles.
     **Daphne:** What happened to my noble savage?
      **Niles:**[_hangs up his coat_] I'll tell you what happened.  Roz told me 
             about this wonderful nude beach, so I went down there this 
             morning to check it out for us.  Well, it was so peaceful I 
             decided to do my sunrise Tai Chi, have my naked body caressed 
             by the rosy fingers of the new dawn, you know?
     **Martin:** Oh, jeez.
    
    [_N.B. Niles's last phrase is an oft-repeated line from Homer._]
    
      **Niles:** Well, I left my clothing and my cares in the car, walked down 
             to the beach and settled in for my first exercise, "Grasping 
             the Bird's Tail."
    _He raises his arms in a martial arts pose.  Daphne nods and mirrors 
    him._
      **Niles:** Just at that moment, the sun peeked over the mountaintops, 
             illuminating not only my splendid nakedness, but the bus for 
             the Christian Women's Society.
     **Martin:** They went to a nude beach?
      **Niles:** No, and neither did I.  Uh, the next few minutes are a blur, 
             as I zig-zagged my way back to the car, while being pelted 
             with driftwood and Bibles.  Needless to say, Island Niles 
             died on that beach.
    _Daphne is trying hard not to laugh, but hugs him maternally._
     **Daphne:** Oh, honey.  Will he ever be back?
      **Niles:** Maybe at Christmas.
    _Frasier comes in._
    **Frasier:** Hello, all. [_sees Niles_] Oh, Niles, welcome back.
    _Claire emerges from the kitchen._
     **Claire:** Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Claire.
     **Claire:** Did you get your luggage?
    **Frasier:** Uh, no.  They didn't have it.  Uh, could I see you in the 
             kitchen for a minute?
     **Claire:** Sure.
    _Frasier follows her into the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** OK, Mr. Crane, it's time for your exercises.
     **Martin:** Already did 'em.
      **Niles:** When have you ever done your exercises before lunch?
     **Martin:** Claire and I did 'em together.  She has a way of making them 
             seem like fun!
     **Daphne:** Yeah, well, if they're fun they're not really working, but 
             all right!
     **Martin:** Actually, Claire says-
     **Daphne:** Oh, shut up.
    _In the kitchen:_
     **Claire:** If we need privacy, it's either very good or very bad.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's-it's not so good, I'm afraid.  Uh, I realize this 
             is sudden.  It's just that I've been tossing and turning for 
             the last several days, and I just can't keep going like this.
     **Claire:** Well, what are you talking about?
    **Frasier:** Well, Claire, I'm talking about... parting ways.  I'm sorry.
    _She is heartbroken._
     **Claire:** It's over?  Just like that?
    **Frasier:** Claire, I realize how painful this must be for you.
    _She kicks him in the right shin._
    **Frasier:** Ow!  You kicked me!
     **Claire:** Well, you dumped me!
    _She storms out._
    **Frasier:** I said I was sorry!
    _She rushes back in and kicks him in the right shin again._
    **Frasier:** OW!
    _Reset to: Hallway
    Niles and Daphne are standing outside the elevator in each other's 
    arms._
      **Niles:** Well, I guess I'll go home and take down the hammock.  I love 
             you, darling. [_kisses her_]
     **Daphne:** I love you, too.
    _As Niles steps onto the elevator, his cell phone rings._
      **Niles:** Hello?  Hello, Roz.  The wrong beach, really?  Thanks for the 
             warning, that would have been embarrassing.
    _The elevator doors close.  As Daphne stands there shaking her head, 
    Claire comes out and tearfully pushes the button._
     **Daphne:** Well, see you later.
     **Claire:** Well, actually you won't.  Frasier just dumped me.
     **Daphne:** What?  What happened?
     **Claire:** I honestly don't know!  I was having such a good time, and... 
             now I'm out here.  I-I don't even know what went wrong! 
    _As she starts to sob, Daphne feels no impulse to hug her, but leans 
    forward sympathetically._
     **Daphne:** Oh, um, I'm sorry.
     **Claire:** I really liked him.  I liked all of you so much.  I was 
             starting to feel like part of the family.  I was... hoping 
             we'd end up like sisters.
     **Daphne:** Sisters?
     **Claire:** I never had a sister, [_voice breaks_] just brothers.
     **Daphne:**[_voice breaks_] Same here!
    _They hug each other, sobbing.
    
    Reset to: Living Room
    Frasier limps out of the kitchen._
     **Martin:** What the hell happened?  Claire just ran out of here without 
             even saying goodbye.
    **Frasier:** We broke up.
     **Martin:** What?!
    **Frasier:** Well, I broke up with her.
     **Martin:** You are a piece of work, aren't you?  You just couldn't 
             stand a good thing, could you?  I bet you were planning on 
             this since Belize.
    **Frasier:** I have not!
     **Martin:** Ah, don't give me that.  You did the same thing you always 
             do: you go around asking everybody's advice, then you just 
             do whatever the hell you want - and it's usually wrong, by 
             the way!
    **Frasier:** Look, I was just being true to my feelings, Dad.  There's no 
             reason to be mad at me.
     **Martin:** I'm not mad at you.  I'm mad at myself.  I knew this was 
             coming and I let myself get attached.
    _Daphne re-enters._
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry, Dad.  Claire's great, it's just she's not the 
             right person for me.  Daphne knows! [_to her_] Will you tell him?
    _Daphne kicks him in the right shin and storms to her room._
    **Frasier:** OW!  Would you people stop doing that!
    _FADE TO:_
    **CHEESE AND SYMPATHY**
    _Scene Five - Lana's House
    Lana opens the door to Frasier and Roz, bearing gifts._
       **Lana:** Oh, come in! [_sees gifts_] Oh, you didn't have to do this!
        **Roz:**[_as she takes them, to Frasier_] Told you.
    _They come in.  The room is occupied by Kirby and a group of his high 
    school friends._
    **Frasier:** I sense a scholar in our midst! [_shakes Kirby's hand_] Ha-ha, 
             congratulations, Kirby!  Let's see the sheepskin!
      **Kirby:** Dude!  Wait until the party gets going a little.
    **Frasier:**[_trades a look with Roz, then_] Good thinking.  I'll just, 
             uh, see what your mother's doing. [_goes to kitchen_]
      **Kirby:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Kirby.
      **Kirby:** Got our prom pictures back.
    _He takes them out and stands next to her to show them._
      **Kirby:** I had them retouched a little.  You're smiling in them now.
        **Roz:**[_looking at the pictures_] I notice you also have your hand on 
             my ass.
      **Kirby:** Where?  Oh, you mean now.  Do you not like it?
    _In the kitchen, Frasier and Lana are spreading spray cheese on crackers._
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm having a devil of a time with this cheese can.
       **Lana:** Just hold the nozzle close to the cracker so you make a 
             little flower, like this. [_does_] Here, try one. [_feeds him 
             the cracker_]
    **Frasier:** Mmm, well, I can honestly say that is the best canned cheese 
             I've ever had. [_they laugh_] Lana, listen, there's something 
             I'd like to talk with you about.
       **Lana:** If this is about Claire, I already know.
    **Frasier:** Oh gosh, I'm so sorry, it's just I-
       **Lana:** Frasier-
    **Frasier:** She's a perfectly wonderful girl-
       **Lana:** You don't have to explain it to me.  I mean, sometimes you 
             just don't feel it.  That's OK.
    **Frasier:** Really?  I thought you'd be mad at me.
       **Lana:** Well, why would I be mad?  I mean, it's not like I get a 
             commission on every match I make. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** So, we're OK?
       **Lana:** Well, sure we're OK.  We're better than OK.
    **Frasier:** Right.  Better than OK.
    _He is about to make his move, when..._
       **Girl:**[_o.s._] You total _slut_!
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh no, Roz.  Uh... [_gets up_]
    _He goes out into the living room, and sees Kirby being braced by his 
    ex-girlfriend, Kristi, who has just arrived with one of her friends._
     **Kristi:** You told me not to come because this was just gonna be some 
             boring party with your mom's friends!
      **Kirby:** Roz is my mom's friend!
     **Kristi:** She was your prom date!
      **Kirby:**...Damn, baby, why you got to be this way?  I'm trying to 
             show you respect by keeping you from seeing my other lady!
        **Roz:** I was never his lady!
      **Kirby:** Damn, baby, that's cold.
     **Kristi:** She's old enough to be your mother practically!
        **Roz:** Damn, baby, now THAT'S cold.
     **Kristi:** Whatever!
    _Kristi and her friend storm out._
      **Kirby:** Wow.  That did not go so great.
    **Frasier:** Well, those things rarely do, Kirby.
    _The door opens again - this time it is the Man from the Airport (Bob)._
        **Bob:** Hey, buddy!
      **Kirby:** Dad, you're here!
        **Bob:** Oh, I wouldn't miss it for anything! [_hugs his son_] Where's 
             Mom?  I really need to talk to her.
      **Kirby:** I'll go get her. [_exits_]
        **Bob:**[_sees Frasier_] Wow, small world!  What are you doing here?
    _Frasier, hoist with his own petard, is speechless.
