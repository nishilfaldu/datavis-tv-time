## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One - KACL
    Frasier is doing his show._
    **Frasier:** So just remember, when you're standing there, that what you're 
             going through...
    _Kenny enters Roz's booth in a hurry and taps her on the shoulder._
      **Kenny:** Why hasn't Frasier mentioned the Spokane thing yet?
        **Roz:** I don't know.  I'm sure we'll get to it by the end of the show.
      **Kenny:** Well, he'd better, because I left him a memo and an email 
             specifically asking him to promote the Spokane thing.  Now 
             ignoring an email is one thing, but a memo and an email? 
             Well, I may have to bring the hammer down and leave a Post-It 
             on his desk.
    **Frasier:** Which brings me to a bit of news.  Starting Monday, there will 
             be a new addition to the Frasier Crane radio family: the city 
             of Spokane.  [_smiles at Kenny_]
      **Kenny:** Oh, thank goodness.  Man, that was like the Cuban Missile Crisis 
             for a moment, wasn't it?
    
    _He leaves the booth._
    
    **Frasier:** In fact, KQZY is not only going to be carrying the show, but 
             they've invited Roz and me to conduct Monday's broadcast from 
             their studios in Spokane.  But fret not, Seattle.  Although my 
             body will be 300 miles away, my heart will be firmly lodged 
             in your radios. [_beat_] You know, that sounded a lot better 
             this morning in the shower.  Anyway, good day and good mental 
             health.
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes in._
        **Roz:** I thought Friday was your bath day.
    **Frasier:** Ah, I woke up late.  So, Roz, what time do you want me to pick 
             up you and Roger on Sunday?
        **Roz:** Oh, there's been a change in plans.  Roger is not coming to 
             Spokane.
    **Frasier:** Really?  Well, nothing wrong, I hope.
        **Roz:** We broke up.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, I'm so sorry.
        **Roz:** We just talked about some problems we'd been having and decided, 
             you know, we'd be better off apart.
    **Frasier:** When did this happen.
        **Roz:** Last week.
    **Frasier:** Last week-?
        **Roz:** I didn't tell you because I didn't want to have a long
             conversation.
    **Frasier:** I understand.  You must be going through a lot right now.  
             You know, back in private practice I used to tell my grief 
             group...
        **Roz:** See, this is exactly what I mean.  I appreciate your concern, 
             but I am fine, really.
    **Frasier:** Okay.  Boy, what a surprise.  No more Roger.
        **Roz:** I know.
    **Frasier:** Yes, he had a rare kind of dignity and integrity you don't 
             see much of nowadays.  Especially among people who own a 
             bench press.  You know, I don't believe I've ever met anyone 
             else with that combination of gentility and brute strength.  
             Well, not anybody single, anyhow.  
    
    _Roz gives a weak laugh._
    **Frasier:** I'm not helping, am I?
        **Roz:** No.
    
    _She goes into her booth.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Apartment
    Frasier comes home from work and sees Niles at the bar pouring sherry._
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** Hey.
    **Frasier:** I thought you and Daphne were going out tonight.
      **Niles:** She's still getting ready.  Hey, Frasier, am I dressed 
             appropriately for something called "Banana-rama"? [_he says 
             wearing his traditional suit_]
    **Frasier:** You're in Armani, who could object?
    
    _They shrug.  Martin comes in._
     **Martin:** Hey, guys.
    **Frasier:** Dad.
    
    _Martin is followed through the door by two workmen carrying a long, 
    flat piece of lumber._
     **Martin:** Uh, just lean it up against the window there, will you? [_they do_]
    **Frasier:** What is this?
     **Martin:** It's mahogany.  Real straight grain, too.  I found it outside 
             the construction site next door?  Can you believe they were 
             going to throw it away?
    **Frasier:** Dad, I thought we had this discussion when you found that 
             mattress on the side of the highway.
     **Martin:** But this isn't for resale, I'm going to make a TV table out of 
             it.  [_tips the workmen as they leave_] Thanks, fellas.  Isn't it 
             a beaut?
      **Niles:**[_inspecting the underside_] There's a ketchup packet stuck to it.
     **Martin:** Oh, it's going to feel good to break out the tools, roll up 
             my sleeves, and make something with my own two hands.
    _As he says this, Frasier and Niles exchange a big look._
    **Frasier:** Dad, are you sure this is a good idea?  Woodworking has never 
             been your strength.
      **Niles:** Yeah, I think the scariest words of my childhood were, 
             "Your father needs your help down in the basement."
     **Martin:** Well, I must have done something right.  I made a lot of 
             good stuff.
    **Frasier:** Even with directions, you could never assemble anything.  
             I remember a play set where the slide ended right in front 
             of the swings.
      **Niles:** I don't remember that.
    **Frasier:** I know.  Sorry.
     **Martin:** Now, I'm gonna build a TV table, and I need a number one helper.  
             Whose turn is it?
    
    _Niles hurriedly points to Frasier._
    **Frasier:** No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I am leaving for Spokane 
             on Sunday, I will not be available.
      **Niles:** Your show's not till Monday!
    **Frasier:** Yes, well I have sponsors to meet, I have press interviews and 
             photo sessions.  Niles, this is a very big step in my career.  
             If I can prove that my brand of radio travels well, perhaps I 
             can parlay Spokane into Denver, Chicago...  maybe even New York 
             City.
     **Martin:**[_to Niles_] Well, you win, buddy.  I'll see you tomorrow.  
             Be sure to wear some work gloves.  Oh, and some coveralls.  
             We don't want a repeat of that necktie-in-the-band-saw
             incident. 
    _He exits._
      **Niles:** Oh, great.  With my luck, there'll be a baseball game on the 
             radio, too.
    **Frasier:** It won't be so bad.
      **Niles:** Oh, how can you say that?  You once tried to report him to the 
             Child Labor Board.
    **Frasier:** Well, at least I was being proactive.  I recall you used to lock 
             yourself in the bathroom to cry.
      **Niles:** I didn't go in there to cry.  I went in to re-gather my 
             patience.
    **Frasier:** Say, Niles, why don't you just ask Daphne to fill in for you?
      **Niles:** Daphne?
    **Frasier:** Well, why not?  She's gonna owe you big time after dragging you 
             to this banana event.
      **Niles:** No, no, it's a concert.  And I hardly think it compares to 
             the torture of assisting Dad.
    _Daphne comes out.  To borrow a phrase from Joe Keenan, "I lack the 
    sartorial vocabulary to describe the result." I have an intimation 
    that it's a fasion of the 70's.  Her hair is done up with an oversized 
    silver bow, she's wearing a pink blouse with an oversized silver belt 
    and a white jacket, and black pants with high white boots._
     **Daphne:** All right, I'm ready.  [_sees him_] Oh, Niles, you're not going 
             in those clothes.  Come with me.  [_takes his hand_] I got you 
             some hair gel and parachute pants.
    
    _As he is led to her room, Niles throws a frightened glance at Frasier.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **GETTING SULLIED**
    _Scene Three - KQZY Meeting Room
    Frasier stands by a podium while the station manager, Herm Evans, 
    prepares him._
       **Herm:** Okay, here's the drill.  Now, I'll introduce you to the 
             reporters, they'll ask you questions.  Try not to go on 
             too much.  The faster we get them to the courtesy liquor, 
             the better.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't worry.  I'll be able to get my message across.  
             You see, I'm a bit of a puppeteer when it comes to the 
             press.
       **Herm:** Good.  [_walks away, but turns back_] But still, liquor.
    
    _Kenny comes through a door behind Frasier._
      **Kenny:** Oh, sorry I'm late, Doc.  I, uh, had a situation at the hotel 
             but it's under control now.
    **Frasier:** Judging from the pillow wrinkles on your cheek, I'd say it 
             was a nap situation.
      **Kenny:** The point is, it's under control.
    
    _Herm comes back._
       **Herm:** Kenny Daly!  Don't say hi or anything?
      **Kenny:** Herm Evans! [_shakes his hand_] So, how's our star doing? 
             Everything go okay with the CPS's?
       **Herm:** Terrific.
      **Kenny:** And your ExecComm?
       **Herm:** Oh, they're thrilled.
      **Kenny:** What about the M-and-M's?
       **Herm:**[_hands him a bowl_] Help yourself.
      **Kenny:** Thanks.
    
    _Roz comes in._
        **Roz:** Hey, everybody.  [_they all greet her_]
    **Frasier:** Oh listen, let me introduce you to Herm Evans, the station 
             manager here.
       **Herm:**[_shakes her hand_] Nice to meet you, Roz.
        **Roz:** Thanks.
       **Herm:** Now that everybody's here, I'll go get the reporters.
    **Frasier:** Right, right.  [_Herm leaves_] Uh, Roz, listen.  Sure you're up 
             to this?
        **Roz:** Yeah, why?  Why wouldn't I be?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's been a tough time lately, you know, with the 
             Roger situation.
        **Roz:** Oh, knock it off, Frasier.  I'm fine.
    **Frasier:** You sure?
        **Roz:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** Because, believe me, I wouldn't blame you if you were 
             struggling a little bit.  I mean, believe me, my head would 
             be filled with "what if's" and "if only's" and, God forbid, 
             the looming question, "What if I'll never again have the 
             chance..." Oh, here comes the press!  All right, big smiles!
    
    _Frasier takes the podium, having thrown Roz back into turmoil, 
    as Herm leads in half a dozen reporters._
       **Herm:** Thanks for coming, everybody! [_to a heavyset photographer_] 
             Hey, Matt, is that a new tie, or did you just have it cleaned? 
             [_laughs_] Hey, there'll be plenty of time for that cheese plate 
             after you've fallen in love with KQZY's proud new addition, 
             Dr. Frasier Crane.
    
    _Polite applause._
    **Frasier:** Thank you, thank you very much.  I'd like to take this 
             opportunity to introduce my lovely producing partner, 
             Roz Doyle.  [_puts his arm around her_] I must say, I'm 
             looking forward to becoming part of the radio landscape 
             here in Spokane.
      **Frank:**[_male reporter_] Dr. Crane, how do you feel about taking over 
             Neal Sullivan's time slot?
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, who?
       **Herm:** Nobody, it's just the guy you're replacing.
      **Cathy:**[_female reporter_] A nobody?  He's been a Spokane institution 
             for 30 years.
       **Herm:** Yes, we all saw your column.  You know what would make another 
             great column?  Dr. Crane went to Harvard and Oxford.  Wow.
      **Frank:** No offense, Dr. Crane, but all your degrees aren't going to 
             make us forget about Sully.
    **Frasier:** And I don't intend that they should.  I don't want you to 
             forget about anyone.  I'm here to help people.
      **Cathy:** Sully helps people.  Every Fourth of July, he organizes a 
             group of troubled teens and cleans up all the trash on the 
             riverbanks.
      **Frank:** Will we be seeing you on the Fourth of July?
       **Herm:**[_turns to the table_] Oh hey, what's this over here?  Free liquor?
    
    _An old man enters through the back door carrying a box._
      **Frank:** Hey, Sully! [_all the reporters greet him_]
      **Sully:** Hey, guys.  Don't let me interrupt.  I'm just clearing out a few 
             things from my desk.  Wanted to stop by and wish my successor 
             luck.
    
    _He shakes hands with Frasier, drawing applause and several flashbulbs._
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you.  Thank you so much, Mr.  Sullivan.  And as 
             someone who has served Spokane so well, your blessing is 
             deeply appreciated.
      **Sully:** Oh, you don't need my blessing.  I'm just a simple man with 
             a passion for Spokane in his heart, and a termination notice 
             in his pocket.
      **Cathy:** Sully, will you be listening to Dr.  Crane's show tomorrow?
      **Sully:** Not sure, Cathy.  I've been going around on that one like the 
             horses on the Looff.
    
    _All the reporters laugh._
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, the Looff?
      **Sully:** It's a carousel.  But I guess you have to be in the city more 
             than three hours to know that.
    
    _More laughter._
      **Frank:** Sully, what are you going to do with your time now?
      **Sully:** Good question, Frank.  When my dad retired, he died a month 
             later.  Take that any way you like.  But, uh...  you know what, 
             fellas, you really should be asking Dr. Crane the questions.  
             Anyone needs me, I'll be down the street at Mulligan's, buying 
             rounds.  Keep smiling.
    
    _Sully walks out._
      **Cathy:** We'll miss you!  Let's hear it for Sully.
      **Press:**[_singing_] For he's a jolly good fellow...
    
    _As they continue, Frasier dismounts the podium, and motions to Kenny 
    for a stiff drink.  Kenny, who has already poured one, hands it to 
    Frasier and then takes a long pull straight from the bottle.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four - Apartment
    Daphne and Martin, wearing work clothes and safety goggles, 
    are standing over a piece of wood on a worktable._
     **Daphne:** Now, I think we're going to need a smaller drill bit.  
             Where's the chuck key?
     **Martin:** The what?
     **Daphne:** You know, [_points behind him_] that thing there.
     **Martin:**[_holds it up, condescending_] The tighten-er.
     **Daphne:** It's called the chuck key.
     **Martin:** Well, maybe in England.  Here in the U.S., it doesn't have a 
             specific name.
     **Daphne:** Did you get the wood screws?
     **Martin:** Oh, damn!  I forgot to pick them up at the hardware store.
     **Daphne:** Well, don't worry, I'll run out and fetch them.
     **Martin:**[_getting his coat_] No, it's all right.  I'll get them.  
             Why don't you get started on the foot pads?
     **Daphne:** All right. [_points_] Watch out for the extension cord.  
             [_he stops_] That's the orange electricity hose.
     **Martin:** I know what it is.  
    
    _The doorbell rings.  Martin opens it to Niles._
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.  I thought you were busy with an emergency at 
             Northwest.
      **Niles:** I-I was.  Actually, I just finished. [_points to his lapel_] 
             See, this is my guest badge, that has today's date on it?  
             You can't fake that.
     **Martin:** Uh-huh.  See you in a half-hour. [_leaves_]
      **Niles:** All right. [_to Daphne_] You look adorable. [_kisses her_] 
             You look like the princess of safety.  Look, I'm so 
             sorry for roping you into this.
    
    _Daphne has removed her goggles and started to apply glue to the pads._
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't be.  Reminds me of when I used to mess about in the 
             garage with my brothers.  Used to build all sorts of things.  
             Splints, crutches, peg legs.
      **Niles:** Still, you're very sweet to help Dad out.  I don't think I 
             could take his bossiness.
     **Daphne:** Oh, he's not so bad.  Could you hand me a rag?
      **Niles:**[_looks_] Uh... sure. [_does_] Any interest in sneaking off to 
             your room while the foreman's away?
     **Daphne:** That sounds lovely, but first I have to get these pads on.  
             Can you press on this for a moment?
      **Niles:** Yeah, no problem. [_does_] Maybe later we'll try out my "Wagner 
             for Lovers" CD.
     **Daphne:** I need another rag.
      **Niles:** Oh, coming up... a rag. [_grabs one while keeping one hand on 
             the pad_]
     **Daphne:** Could you grab me some sandpaper, too?
      **Niles:**[_fumbling_] Uh, yeah, sure.  Of course.
     **Daphne:** Don't press too tight or the pad will slide.
      **Niles:** Oh.
     **Daphne:** Careful, even pressure. [_fixes his hand_] Like this.
      **Niles:** Yeah, that's-that's what I'm doing.
     **Daphne:** Well, then why is glue squirting out?  I need the rag.
      **Niles:** Okay. [_hands it to her_] Never said I was good at carpentry.
     **Daphne:** Carpentry?  This is gluing felt.  Can you hand me the square?
      **Niles:** Ah, yes. [_does_] Here's the square.
     **Daphne:** No, no, no, [_points_] that one.  Why is the pad hanging off the 
             side?
      **Niles:** Well, I think that it slipped when I was handing you the rags 
             and the sandpaper and the square, and by the way, you're 
             welcome.
     **Daphne:** By the way, still waiting for that sandpaper.
      **Niles:**[_straightens up_] Okay, let's stop.
    
    _He walks over and sits on the ottoman, and takes a deep breath._
      **Niles:** This is as bad as working with Dad.
     **Daphne:** Look, Niles, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  I'm just 
             trying to get this done and get it done well.  Okay?
      **Niles:** Okay.
     **Daphne:** I love you.
      **Niles:** I love you, too.
     **Daphne:** And yet, I'm still waiting for that sandpaper.
    
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five - KQZY Studio
    Frasier surveys the radio booth while Roz is trying to get comfortable 
    at her console.  Unlike KACL, this studio has no divide between the 
    talent and producer's desks._
    **Frasier:** You know, this layout doesn't really allow us to do any call 
             screening.  Well, I guess you can still just check the sound 
             levels.
        **Roz:** Oh boy, the sound levels?  "Dear Diary, after years and years 
             of wishing..."
    **Frasier:** Yes, all right, Roz.
    _Kenny and Herm enter._
      **Kenny:** Hey, Doc.  Everything all right here?
    **Frasier:** Yeah, it's fine.
        **Roz:** But guess who gets to check the sound levels?
    **Frasier:** I said all right, Roz.
      **Kenny:** Just wanted to make sure you're relaxed and ready to go...  
             and haven't read today's paper.
    **Frasier:** I read it.  Everything from the adoring salute to Sully, 
             to the cartoon of me and Satan doing a jig on Sully's coffin.
       **Herm:** About that - it might be a good idea to steer clear of any 
             on-air references to Sully.
    **Frasier:** On the contrary, I intend to confront this situation head-on.  
             I intend to reach out to the listeners, ease their suffering, 
             and thereby demonstrate what we do best.
       **Herm:** Now, that's the kind of attitude this station needs.  Of course, 
             if your ratings are low, I still have to fire you. [_laughs_] What 
             a crazy business, huh?
        **Roz:** Ten seconds.
      **Kenny:** Knock 'em dead.
    
    _Kenny and Herm exit._
        **Roz:**[_whispering_] Good luck. [_points_]
    **Frasier:** Hello, and welcome from Seattle to Spokane, this is the Frasier 
             Crane Radio Network.  We are broadcasting today from the Lilac 
             City where we have just replaced a beloved local icon, Neal 
             Sullivan.  Now, Sully did a lot for this city and in my own way 
             I hope to make the same kind of contribution that he did.  With 
             that in mind, let's go to the phones.
    
    _He looks at Roz, who points back at him.  He looks at his own board, 
    and presses a button._
     **Frasier:** Go ahead, caller.  I'm listening.
    **Caller 1:**[_v.o._] Go back to Seattle. [_hangs up_]
    
    _Frasier cuts off the dial tone._
        **Roz:** How was the level on that?
    
    _Frasier makes a sour face at her._
     **Frasier:** Now, now, people, I understand how you might be angry, 
              and there's nothing wrong with venting that feeling, 
              but please stay on the line long enough for me to respond.  
              [_presses another button_] Go ahead, I'm listening.
    **Caller 2:**[_v.o._] Hi, I'm just letting all the Sully fans know we're 
              boycotting KQZY until he comes back.
     **Frasier:** Now people, please, we need to talk.  We need to move forward.  
              Otherwise, we're just going to be going around and around like 
              the horses on the Looff!
    _He gives Roz a thumbs-up, but Caller 2 hangs up.  Frasier cuts it off._
    **Frasier:** All right, well, you know, perhaps our callers from Seattle 
             could help show the new folds how it's done. [_looks at his 
             alternate board_] I'm afraid we don't have any calls from 
             Seattle.  This is strange.  Um...  perhaps this would be a 
             good time to go to a commercial break here on the Frasier 
             Crane Radio Network.
    
    _He goes to commercial.  Kenny and Herm come in._
      **Kenny:** Hey-hey, you're doing great.
    **Frasier:** I am not, they hate me.
      **Kenny:** Okay, since we're being straight... um, Herm doesn't think 
             it's going very well.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, where's my support?  Where are the callers from 
             Seattle?
      **Kenny:** Seattle isn't getting the signal. [_looks at Herm_]
       **Herm:** Well, something's obviously screwed up at KACL.
      **Kenny:** Oh, it's not KACL.  It's probably that transmitter you bought 
             off the Ukrainian Internet. [_exits_]
       **Herm:**[_follows him out_] Hey, 20 minutes ago you were really impressed 
             with that Ukrainian Internet.
    **Frasier:** I'm sure the people of Spokane would just get on board if 
             they could get some understanding of what we actually do.  
             We could use a...  like an example.  You know, a sample call.  
             [_looks at Roz_]
        **Roz:** Are you asking me to call in?
    **Frasier:** Roz, please?  I tell you what - just make up something, 
             anything at all.
        **Roz:** Okay.  Five seconds.
    
    _She cues him, and then picks up the phone._
    **Frasier:** Hello, and welcome back to the Frasier Crane Show.  We are 
             broadcasting today from KQZY in beautiful Spokane. [_Roz holds 
             up four fingers_] Let's go to the phones. [_presses line four_] 
             Hello, caller.  I'm listening.
        **Roz:** Hi, Dr.  Crane.  My name is Ro... berta, and, um... I'm afraid 
             of the dark.
    
    _She smiles at him.  He gives her a "you can do better than that" look._
    **Frasier:** What is it about the dark that frightens you?
        **Roz:** Um... I don't know.  Um...
    
    _Long pause._
    **Frasier:** Often a fear of darkness is a fear of the unknown.  It is 
             in darkness where our imaginations give shape to our deepest 
             anxieties.  What image comes to mind for you?
        **Roz:** Nothing, actually.
    **Frasier:**[_eyes furious_] Nothing?
        **Roz:** Yeah, when everything disappears, there's nothing.  Just 
             emptiness.
    **Frasier:** I see.  And what is it about the emptiness that frightens you?
        **Roz:** It's... lonely, for one thing.
    **Frasier:** Have you always felt this way?
        **Roz:** For a while I didn't.
    **Frasier:** What was different then?
        **Roz:** I had somebody.  A guy I really liked.  And then we broke up...  
             [_breaks down crying_] Oh God, Frasier.  I miss him so much.  
             I-I don't know how I fell in love again.  I mean, I swore I 
             wouldn't.  I knew better.  I _should_ have known better!  And 
             then, sure enough, six months in, he tells me there's no 
             fireworks.  And what am I supposed to say? [_sobs_]
    **Frasier:** I'm so sorry.  But listen to me.  You can't blame yourself for 
             letting someone into your heart.  Love is always a risk.  But 
             you have to take it.  The pain you're feeling now will pass 
             in time, and you'll find yourself ready to take that risk 
             again.  Until then... take comfort in your friends.  They want 
             to help you.  They love you.
        **Roz:** Yeah, thanks.
    **Frasier:** You're welcome.
    
    _They throw off their headphones, get up and embrace.
    
    Kenny rushes in, pointing urgently at the lit-up "ON THE AIR" sign.  
    They break apart and resume their positions._
     **Frasier:** Okay, Spokane.  Let's hear what you have to say. [_presses 
              button_] Go ahead, caller.  I'm listening.
    **Caller 3:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr.  Crane.  I was going to say "you suck" but while 
              the phone was ringing I heard that last caller and I just want 
              to tell her to hang in there.
     **Frasier:**[_smiles at Roz_] That's very kind of you. [_presses another 
              button_] Go ahead, caller.  I'm listening.
        **Carl:**[_v.o._] Hi, uh, my name's Carl.
     **Frasier:** Hello, Carl.
        **Carl:** I'm kind of going through the same thing as that Roberta woman.
     **Frasier:** Really?  Well, then perhaps you could share your experience 
              with us and possibly help Roberta and some of our other 
              listeners.
        **Carl:** Well, it's hard to talk about.  She hasn't technically dumped 
              me yet, but I'm pretty sure it's coming.  And I don't know if 
              I should bring it up first, or just avoid the whole subject 
              and hope things get better.
    
    _Frasier and Roz smile at each other - they're into their groove._
    **Frasier:** Well, Carl, uh...  these problems rarely resolve themselves.  
             I realize that an honest conversation at this point may be 
             a little daunting, but...
    
    _As he goes on, we FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - Apartment
    Daphne is sanding the finished TV table._
     **Daphne:** I'm finished!  It turned out great.  
    
    _Looking somewhat guilty, she steps over to the powder room._
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry I yelled at you.  You were a big help.  I couldn't 
             have done it without you.
    
    _The door slowly opens, and Martin comes out, subdued._
     **Martin:** You mean it?
     **Daphne:** Absolutely.  Come and take a look.
     **Martin:** Oh, that is sharp!  Niles, come look at the table.
    
    _Daphne looks guilty again as Niles slowly follows Martin out of the 
    powder room.   His eyes are red-rimmed._
      **Niles:**[_sulky_] I like the footpads.
    _END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles and Martin are sitting on the floor applying varnish to the TV 
    table.  Daphne comes in the front door, gives them each a kiss, and then 
    goes to the kitchen.
    
    Niles and Martin, finished, start to rise - but Niles has caught his tie 
    in the table.
    
    They hurriedly sit down again as Daphne comes out with drinks for them, 
    acting as if they're still working.
