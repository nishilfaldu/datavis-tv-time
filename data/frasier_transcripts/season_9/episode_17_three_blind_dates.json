NB: This is an inside joke.  Toward the end of last season, NBC contracted with NASCAR to carry some events.  They then began an ad campaign which spoofed another ad campaign (the product is unimportant) featuring an announcer describing the movie**You've Got Mail** and asking the audience if they had seen it.  The ad then showed a rough-looking western type of man and the announcer said \"This guy hasn't seen it.\"  NBC's take on it went something like this: \"You know that show _Frasier_?  It has the two brothers who are psychiatrists and they go to operas and sit drinking Lattes.  You know that show?\" All the while, the picture showed shots of auto races and pit stops, etc. A NASCAR driver was then shown.  The announcer continued: \"It's on the same network as this guy!\"  Kelsey was somewhat irritated at the ad, and this joke with Niles mispronouncing \"NASCAR\" is meant as a jab at NBC.  This is not the first little stab the writers have taken at the network this season.
