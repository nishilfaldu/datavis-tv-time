A Note On The "Weeping Lotus" Murder...{Mike Lee}

    
    
    
    It's a familiar dramatic device for a retired cop to keep mementos
    of the one case he never solved, and Martin is no exception.
    
    The name "Weeping Lotus," naming the victim in his case after a flower, 
    is an obvious homage to the celebrated "Black Dahlia" murder in 1950's 
    Los Angeles.  The Dahlia was a struggling actress named Elizabeth 
    Short, who was kidnapped, murdered, and dismembered in secret, then the 
    parts of her body were strewn over an abandoned lot.  To this day the 
    killer has never been identified.
    
    James Ellroy's "The Black Dahlia" is a highly readable pseudo-history 
    of this horrible crime -- just bear in mind that he makes up his own 
    culprit.
    
    Martin's "Weeping Lotus" murder is referred to intermittently through 
    Season One and the preceding episodes in Season Two but this episode 
    apparently shows that the writers felt they had carried this gag as far 
    as it would go.

    _Act 1_
    **RETIREMENT IS MURDER**
    _Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_
    _Fade in.  Frasier is gazing out the balcony door, drinking sherry.  
    Martin and Daphne are at the table wit a bunch of files._
    
    **Frasier:** Ah, yes.  Another beautiful Saturday night.  The moon is full, 
             the city lights are twinkling, lovers steal kisses in the 
             park...  and here, Chez Crane, my father and his assistant 
             sit hunched over twenty year-old photographs of a murdered 
             hooker. [_raises his glass_] Life is a banquet.
     **Daphne:** I enjoy looking at your father's old case.  Just because 
             you have no plans tonight, don't spoil our harmless fun.  
             You know, there's nothing we Brits like better than a 
             grisly murder and a nice hot cup of tea.
     **Martin:** Uh, listen Daphne, I got a lot of work to do here, so if 
             you don't mind...
     **Daphne:** Oh, excuse me.  I didn't know I was bothering you.
     **Martin:** Oh, I'm sorry, it's this damn case.  I feel like the answer 
             to who murdered Helen is right here.  I just can't see it.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you're obsessing.  You stare at these grisly pictures 
             day after day, night after night.  Come on, why don't we go 
             out and see a movie?
     **Martin:** No, thanks.
    **Frasier:** Let's go get a pizza.
     **Martin:** Nah.
    **Frasier:** Let's get tattooed. [_Martin thinks about it, then shakes 
             his head._] Oh!  This is ridiculous.  It's a beautiful 
             night and I'm not going to miss it.  I'm going to go out and
             take a long walk and I'm not going by myself.
    _Eddie runs out with his leash._
     **Martin:** He likes the rhododendrons on the north side of the park.
    _Fade out.
    
    Scene 2 - KACL
    
    Fade in.  Frasier is on the air with Marjorie._
    **Marjorie:**[v.o.] And I just wanted to thank you, Dr. Crane.  Because of 
              your advice, I've conquered my fear of heights.  I, I took it 
              slowly, gradually going higher and higher, until here I am, 
              right now, having lunch at the top of the Space Needle!
     **Frasier:** Marjorie, congratulations.  I am so proud of you.
    **Marjorie:** I mean, when I think of how you... [_she screams loudly_]
     **Frasier:** God, what's wrong?  What happened?
    **Marjorie:** I just looked down.
     **Frasier:** Well, Marjorie, don't do that.  Look at your luncheon 
              companion, look at your menu, but don't look down.  
              You're only feeding your fears when you do that.
    **Marjorie:** Maybe I wasn't ready for a window table.
     **Frasier:** No, no, no.  Of course you are, of course you are.  You can
              beat this thing.
    **Marjorie:** You're right, I can, Dr. Crane, if I just... [_she screams 
              again_]
     **Frasier:** Do not look down!
    **Marjorie:** No, I didn't.  My check just came.
     **Frasier:** Oh, well, Marjorie, we're just about out of time now.  
              Call me tomorrow, will you?  Well, that's it for today 
              folks.  Stay tuned for Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe.  This is 
              Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780, talk radio.
    _He switches off, Bulldog comes in, wheeling his trolley._
    **Bulldog:** Hey, Doc.  
    **Frasier:** Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** I caught the first hour of your show today.  If that chick 
             whining about sexual harassment called my show, I'd say 
             "Listen doll, you don't want people snapping your bra, 
             don't wear one."
    **Frasier:** Brilliant in its simplicity.
    **Bulldog:**[_to Roz_] Hey, how's this sound, hardbody: You, me, Sonics, 
             Nicks, tonight.
        **Roz:** Sorry Bulldog, but I'm already going.  I have season tickets.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, we can still get together afterwards.
        **Roz:** Only if I smash into your car in the parking lot.
    **Bulldog:** Why is it the ones who want it the most put up the biggest 
             struggle?
        **Roz:** Because, when I do finally give in, I want us to enjoy it 
             all the more.  
    _Bulldog gives her a kind of hopeful look._
        **Roz:** That is, if I'm not too distracted by the fact that every 
             man on Earth has died. [_stalks off_]
    **Bulldog:** Almost had her there.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it could have gone either way.
    **Bulldog:** Ah, well, with my pull I can get those anytime I want.
    _He tosses the tickets down, Niles comes in._
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh, Bulldog, have you met my brother Niles?  Niles, 
             this is Bulldog Briscoe.
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh, just the man I want to talk to.  As a sports 
             expert I'm sure you can tell me why none of the local media 
             carry the Ivy League squash standings.
    **Bulldog:**[_bursts out laughing_] Whoa!  Another one just like you.  
             Some gypsy put a curse on your family?  Well, I gotta run.  
             See you later, Miles.
      **Niles:** It's, it's Niles.
    **Bulldog:** Like it matters.
      **Niles:** Well, you ready for our boys night out at La Cochan Noir?  
    _He puts his hand down and accidentally honks Bulldog's horn._
    **Frasier:** Yes.  But Niles, I've been wondering:  Would you mind if I 
             asked Dad to join us?
      **Niles:** Remember the last time we took Dad to a four-star 
             restaurant?  He had a miserable time.  The restaurant lost 
             a whole star.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's just I'm trying desperately to come up with some 
             way to get him out of the house.  He's off on one of his 
             "Weeping Lotus" binges again.
      **Niles:** We've tried distracting him before.  We've taken him 
             everywhere from the arboretum to the zen garden.  [_thinks_]  
             Wait a minute, the zen garden is at the arboretum.  Good 
             lord, is it possible we've only taken him one place?
    **Frasier:**[_spotting the tickets_] Oh, Niles, Niles, this is it, this 
             is it.  The basketball game!
      **Niles:** Basketball?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, I can get another ticket from the promotional 
             department.  Oh, this is perfect.  Just imagine how excited 
             Dad will be to go to a game with his two sons.  My God, 
             it's the archetypal male bonding ritual!
      **Niles:** Couldn't we just go into the woods, kill something and have 
             done with it? [_off Frasier's glare_] All right.
    **Frasier:** Come on Niles, look, it'll give you a chance to see the 
             Tacoma Dome.
      **Niles:**[_as they walk out_] I've already seen it.  They had a home 
             show there, once.  You know, that's where I got that idea 
             to stencil a grape arbor on our Wilkes dresser.
    **Frasier:** I'm a Teamster compared to you.
    _Fade out._
    **STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND**
    _Scene 3 - The Tacoma Dome
    
    Fade in.  Niles and Martin are in their seats.  Niles is looking around._
    **Salesman:** Peanuts!  Peanuts here, peanuts!
      **Martin:** Niles, the game is that way.
       **Niles:** I know, I'm just calculating our escape routes in case of fire
              or urban unrest.  Maris taught me that.
      **Martin:** You love her, don't you?
       **Niles:** Yes I do.  Why?
      **Martin:** It just helps to know that.
    _Frasier comes over with snacks._
    **Frasier:** Here we are:  one beer, and two glasses of wine.  I'm sure
             it's good, Niles, they opened a fresh box when they poured
             it.
    _Niles sniffs the glass, reels, and puts it down without drinking._
     **Martin:** What are you guys doin' drinkin' wine at a ball game?  You
             should be drinkin' beer.
      **Niles:** Dad, I only drink beer when I eat German food.  Which is to
             say, never.  [to Frasier]  Did you notice where the
             facilities are when you were up?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Niles, it's just as you feared: communal urinals in the
             mens room.
      **Niles:** Oh, fine.  What am I supposed to do about my shy kidneys?
    **Frasier:** So, Dad, aren't these great seats, huh?
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** What's the matter with you?
     **Martin:** Uh, nothin'.  Let me borrow your pen a minute, will ya?
    **Frasier:**[handing it over]  What for?
     **Martin:** Well, I was thinking about that ballistics report and I just 
             want to make a note so I won't forget it.
    **Frasier:** Dad, the whole idea of coming here tonight was to get your 
             mind off of the case.  Listen I've done some reading.  It seems 
             the key for the Sonics is to stop Starts from penetrating 
             and dumping the ball off for easy baskets.
      **Niles:** Stop Starts?  That sounds funny.  Stop Starts.  Stop Starts, 
             stopstarts, stopstarts...
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up, Niles!
     **Martin:** It makes no sense.
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, it's not my theory, I'm just quoting some 
             sports writer.
     **Martin:** No, I mean Helen.  She was tall.  She was five feet seven.  
             Yet the bullet entered on a downward trajectory.
    **Frasier:** Dad, please try to participate.  Ooh, look!  They're 
             starting the wave!  Ooh, it's coming this way, it's coming
             this way!
    _The wave comes, Frasier jumps up with it, Martin and Niles don't 
    move.  Niles is putting on a headset._
    
    **Frasier:** That was fun, wasn't it?  Oh, look, there's a peanut guy!  
             [_calling out_]  Peanuts!
    _A bag of peanuts is thrown into Niles's lap.  He throws it back and
    forth._
      **Niles:** How dare you!  Stop it!  That hooligan is pelting me with 
             peanuts!  From the look of that tray, he's come prepared.  
             Stop it!
    **Frasier:** Stop it, that is for me!
     **Martin:** I gotta go make a call.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, this isn't about the case, is it?
     **Martin:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, look, you've been working on it for twenty years, 
             how come you're so obsessed now?
     **Martin:** Look, when Helen was murdered, I made a promise to her mother.  
             I said that no matter how long it took, I'd find the killer.  
             Well, I had a call from her last week, and she's an old lady 
             now, living in a home somewhere and, I don't know, she just 
             doesn't seem to have a lot longer to go, and it just kind of 
             lit a fire under me to get this thing solved.  So, I 
             appreciate your bringing me here, but I gotta make this call.  
             I'll be back in a couple of minutes.  [_He gets up to go to the 
             phones._]
    **Frasier:** Okay, Dad.  I understand.
    _Martin leaves.  A man comes down and sits beside Niles._
        **Fan:** Boy, the traffic tonight is murder.  [_to Niles_]  Hey pal, 
             what's the score?
      **Niles:** West Side Story.
    _The man and Frasier both look confused, Niles makes a little 
    "conducting" gesture.  Fade out.
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment
    
    Fade in.  Martin and Daphne are again poring over the "Weeping
    Lotus" material._
    
     **Martin:** You know what's always bugged me?  This picture of the crime 
             scene.  The way Helen's written "help."  Why would she do  
             that?
     **Daphne:** Well, I suppose the word "howdy" would have been a bit too 
             cheery under the circumstances.  [_She goes to the kitchen._]
     **Martin:** But it makes no sense: anybody who could read "help" in the 
             dirt could also see Helen lying there.
    _Frasier and Niles come in the front door._
    **Frasier:** Evening, Dad.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
     **Martin:** Oh, listen, thanks again for the ball game.  It was great.
    **Frasier:** Oh, God, it was a pleasure, Dad.  I'm only sorry you 
             couldn't join us for dinner afterwards.  La Cochan Noir 
             gave us a late seating for a fabulous dinner.
    _They go to the liquor shelf._
      **Niles:** It was an exquisite meal, marred only by the lack of even 
             one outstanding cognac on their carte de digestif.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but think of it this way, Niles: what is the one thing 
             better than an exquisite meal?  An exquisite meal with one 
             tiny flaw we can pick at all night.  
    _He hands Niles a brandy._
      **Niles:** Ah... quite right.  To impossible standards. [_They clink 
             glasses._]
    **Frasier:** So, Dad, any progress on the case?
     **Martin:** Nah, I'm beat.  Sometimes it's better to just get a good 
             night's sleep and start fresh in the morning.  Good night, 
             fellas.
    **Frasier:** Night, Dad.
      **Niles:** Don't forget: brush your teeth and say your prayers.
     **Martin:**[_laughing_] That's what I used to say to you guys when you 
             were kids, didn't I?
    **Frasier:** No, you didn't.
     **Martin:** Oh.  I meant to.
      **Niles:** We knew that.
    _He leaves.  Daphne comes from the kitchen with a mug of tea.  
    Frasier sits at the table._
     **Daphne:** Hello.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne
     **Daphne:** How was your dinner?
      **Niles:** It was fine, except for one small flaw. 
     **Daphne:** Oh, just the way you like it.  I see you're a bit intrigued 
             by that yourself.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well it's been a while since I've gone over this.  Who 
             are these guys?
     **Daphne:** Oh, just some of the principal players in our little drama.  
             [_she passes over a photo_] That's Detective Shelby, the vice 
             cop who found the body.
      **Niles:** Who is this menacing little mono-brow?
     **Daphne:** Oh, that's Robbethai, a logger.  An ex-boyfriend of Helen's.  
             He used to come down from the mountains every couple of 
             months and disappear with her.
      **Niles:** If you ask me, he's the murderer. 
     **Daphne:** Impossible, he's got an air-tight alibi.
      **Niles:** What is it?
     **Daphne:** He was killing somebody else at the time.  But you have to 
             admit, this case has it all: sex, greed, jealousy, revenge, 
             a monkey, hatred, deception...
    **Frasier:** Wait, wait, wait... 
     **Daphne:** What?
    **Frasier:** A monkey?
      **Niles:** Yeah.  This is a snapshot of the murder victim with her pet 
             monkey, Koko.  He was given to her by another boyfriend, 
             Clive Brisbane.
    **Frasier:** Well, why wasn't Brisbane a suspect?
     **Daphne:** Well, he was, but several witnesses saw him at the 
             racetrack at the time of the murder.
      **Niles:** Excuse me, is that Clive Brisbane the animal trainer?
     **Daphne:** That's right.  Brisbane's Amazing Apes.  They opened in Las 
             Vegas for Englebert Humperdink.
    **Frasier:** Yes, it's easy to forget there was a time when Las Vegas 
             wasn't the tacky place it is now.
      **Niles:** You know, I actually caught Brisbane's act on a trip to Las 
             Vegas during college.  Those apes were amazing!  One minute, 
             they'd be staging a living tableaux of George Washington 
             crossing the Delaware, the next they'd be shooting suction cup 
             arrows at Brisbane's lovely assistant's derriere.
    **Frasier:** You know, there is a way that Brisbane could be the killer, 
             and still have his horse track alibi hold up.  Daphne, 
             Niles, I present you with... the killer!  [_He turns around a 
             photo of a chimpanzee._]
     **Daphne:** A monkey was the trigger man?
    **Frasier:** Just play along with me here.  They're capable of shooting 
             arrows, why not a gun?
     **Daphne:** But why would Brisbane have her killed?
    **Frasier:**[_getting up_] Because, because she jilted him for someone else.
     **Daphne:** Robbethai, the logger!
    **Frasier:** Exactly!  My God, we've done it! 
     **Daphne:** No, you've done it, Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Well, yes!  But you were standing very close by.  Wait a 
             minute.  Are we saying here that a murder was committed by a 
             monkey?
      **Niles:** It's not so very farfetched!  It could be Brisbane's 
             diabolical homage to the Edgar Allan Poe story "Murders in 
             the Rue Morgue."  It's all about an orangutan who goes 
             about the rooftops of Paris murdering people.  Wait 'til we 
             tell Dad his case has finally been solved!  Dad!  Dad!
    **Frasier:** No.  Niles, Niles, wait, wait.  It's still just a theory.  
             Even if we are right, just think how Dad would feel, 
             knowing we cracked a case he couldn't solve in twenty 
             years.
     **Daphne:** Oh, dear, you're right.
    **Frasier:** Wait.  It's merely serendipity that I stumbled into this.  
             Why can't it happen again?  I simply rearrange the photos 
             in a way that Dad will see the connection.  All right, 
             we've got Koko, the gun, and Helen.
    _Martin comes from his room._
     **Martin:** What is it?  No, hey, Frasier!  What are you doin' over 
             there?
    **Frasier:** Sorry Dad.
     **Martin:** No, no, no, I got these all set out the way I want 'em.  
              This one goes up...
    _He stares at the photos as the others look hopefully at him._
     **Martin:** I'll be damned. 
    **Frasier:** Something wrong? 
     **Martin:** Look at that! 
    **Frasier:** What? 
     **Martin:** Well, I never thought it would just leap out and bite me 
             like this.  I think I may have solved this pain in the ass 
             case.
      **Niles:** You have?
    **Frasier:** Dad, Dad, that's wonderful news! 
     **Martin:** Oh, no, no.  Don't get too excited.  I mean, this is kind of 
             farfetched.  I mean, it's a long shot, but, it's 
             beginning to make sense to me.
    **Frasier:** Here, lay it all out for us.
     **Martin:** No, no guys, please, just give me a little privacy, will ya?  
             I just gotta do some thinking.
      **Niles:** No problem, Dad.
     **Daphne:** I was just going to bed meself.  Night, all.
      **Niles:**[_turning to stare after her_] Goodnight, Daphne.
    _Frasier walks over to stand by Niles._
      **Niles:** Oh, look at him.  Do you see the sparkle in his eye?  
             Oh, Frasier, he's like a little kid at Christmas. 
     **Martin:** Oh, geez, what happened to my entry wound close-ups?
    **Frasier:** Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
    _Fade out._
    **USE A MONKEY, GO TO JAIL**
    _Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment
    
    Fade in.  Daphne is sitting on the couch, Frasier enters._
    **Frasier:** Hello Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Is Dad home?
     **Daphne:** Nope, I haven't seen him since he knocked me up early this 
             morning.
    _Frasier, putting his coat up, slows and turns._
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Daphne:** Knocked me up.  Woke me up.  It's an English expression.  
             What does it mean here?
    **Frasier:** Oh, something else.  You'd definitely be awake for it,
             though.  [_He heads for the sherry._]
     **Daphne:** He was headed down to the station house to present his theory.
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God, I wish he hadn't done that.  You know, I've been 
             turning it over in my mind all day.  The more I think about 
             it, the goofier it sounds.  I mean, a MONKEY.  Let's hope they 
             didn't laugh him out of the station, be one hell of way to 
             end a thirty year police career.
     **Daphne:** Oh, now, now, Dr. Crane, it's not the most outlandish theory 
             in the world.
    **Frasier:** You're right, I could have said it was a trained giraffe.  
             I suppose it killed her by spitting a bullet at her, thus 
             explaining the downward trajectory.
    _Martin comes in the front._
     **Martin:** Hey, guys.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Hi, Dad.
     **Martin:** I don't suppose we've heard anything from the station house, 
             huh?
     **Daphne:** Not yet.
     **Martin:** I was afraid of that.  I mean I knew my theory was a bit iffy, 
             but when I told the guys they looked at me like I'd lost my 
             mind.
    **Frasier:** Geez, they didn't ridicule you, did they?
     **Martin:** Oh, no, they always treat old timers with respect.  They said 
             "I'll check it out."  Just like I used to when some nutbag'd
             come in there with aluminum foil in his hat claiming the 
             Martians were trying to steal his brain waves.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, Mr. Crane.
     **Martin:** Oh, I don't know what I was thinking of.  I've been walking 
             around all afternoon just trying to figure out how I came 
             up with such a half-assed theory.
    **Frasier:** Dad, it wasn't your fault.  I did it.
     **Martin:** You killed her?
    **Frasier:** No.  But I did plant that ridiculous idea in your head.  
             Remember last night when you came in, so upset that I was 
             rearranging your pictures?  Well, I rearranged them in a 
             specific way so that you would... come to the same conclusion 
             I did. 
     **Martin:** So you had the idea first?
    **Frasier:** I can't tell you how terrible I feel.
     **Martin:** Ah, don't blame yourself.  You might have put the aluminum 
             foil in my hat, but I walked right into the station wearin' 
             it.
    _The doorbell rings._
     **Daphne:** I'll get it.
    _She opens the door.  A man in casual clothes comes in._
      **Frank:** Hiya, Marty.
     **Martin:** Hey, Frank.  Frasier, Daphne, you remember Frank Hollings 
             from the precinct?
      **Frank:** Hey Marty, we gotta talk.
     **Martin:** Frank, about that theory of mine...
      **Frank:** I can't for the life of me figure what you were thinking.
     **Martin:** I know, I know.  I just feel so stupid, wasting your time.
      **Frank:** It cost us a whole afternoon, and five detectives' time.  
             And all we got to show for it is... heh, heh, we got the 
             bastard!
     **Martin:** I was right?
      **Frank:** Hey, you don't believe me, ask these derelicts.
    _He opens the door and a bunch of cops, some in uniform, come in with 
    beers.  They are all congratulating Martin: "Hey!  Way to go, Marty!" 
    "Marty, you still got it!  "And it only took you twenty years!"_
     **Daphne:** Oh, Mr. Crane, I'm so proud of you.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's amazing, that's wonderful! [_as a man spills beer
             on the couch_]  Oh, that's suede!
    _He and Daphne rush to the kitchen to get towels._
        **Cop:** So Marty, how did you do it?
     **Martin:** Well, you know, for years, I thought it was Robbethai, the
             logger.  And then I thought, well, maybe it was Brisbane the
             animal trainer, but I was wrong.
      **Frank:** How did you finally decide that it was Detective Shelby?
     **Martin:** Well, I kept lookin' at that picture, and it kept buggin' me, 
             you know?  Why was she trying to write "help" in the dirt 
             and then it came to me!   She was trying to write the 
             killer's name, "Shelby."  Only she must've died before she 
             finished the "b" and, and somebody must've kicked dirt over 
             the "s."
     **Frank:** Well, you nailed him all right.  We pulled him in for 
             interrogation and he cracked like a nut.
    _CUT TO - the kitchen._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry I ever doubted you.  But, then, you yourself 
             were beginning to wonder if a monkey could really commit a 
             murder.
    **Frasier:** Well, I may have momentarily doubted it, but from time to 
             time I have to be reminded to trust my gift.
    _They leave.  Cut to - the living room as they enter._
     **Martin:** So, did you call the girl's mother yet?
      **Frank:** Nah, we left that for you.  After all, you were the guy who 
             solved this thing.
     **Martin:** Ah, well, actually, I can't take all the credit for it, 
             right Frasier?  Come on, get over here.
    **Frasier:** Now, now, Dad.
     **Martin:** Nah, come on, don't be shy.  I'm proud of ya.  You know, 
             I was a cop for thirty years and it took my son with his 
             Ph.D. mind to crack this baby.
     **Daphne:** Of course, I was standing next to him at the time.
      **Frank:** So, tell us about it, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no.
    _They all shout encouragement._
    **Frasier:** All right, I hate to toot my own horn, but, if it will make 
             Dad happy.  I suppose it was my expertise in human behavior, 
             combined with a lifelong enthusiasm for the Rwandan lowland 
             gorilla that first set me thinking about the monkey.
    _Everyone looks confused._
      **Frank:** I'm not sure I'm following you.
    **Frasier:** Perhaps I'm going too fast, I'll go slower.  The key was when 
             I figured out if Brisbane could teach a monkey to impersonate 
             George Washington, then surely he could teach a monkey to cock 
             a revolver, sneak up a fire escape, lie in wait for Helen, 
             pump her full of lead and then make his getaway, perhaps even 
             still wearing the revolutionary war regalia in order to confuse
             any chance witnesses.  In fact, oh and this is way out there,
             but geez, maybe you should check to see if there were any local 
             bank robberies at the time that were committed by a short, 
             hairy man wearing a powdered wig.
    _There is a long silence._
     **Martin:** You think the monkey was the killer?
     **Daphne:** When I said I was standing next to him, I was really most 
             of the way across the room. [_She leaves._]
    **Frasier:** Well, wasn't he? 
     **Martin:** No, it was Shelby.
    **Frasier:** Who's Shelby?
     **Martin:** He was a vice cop.  He was in love with Helen.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Well, that was my second choice.  
    _Everyone bursts out laughing._
    **Frasier:** Can I freshen anyone's drink?
      **Frank:** Help me out here, Frasier.  What did you think the monkey's 
             motive was?  Jealousy?  Or maybe he just did it for the 
             insurance money.
        **Cop:** Hey, hey, hey.  Do you think we should put a tail on that 
             monkey?
    **Another:** If that monkey did it, he'll swing for this. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, that's all very funny.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, Frasier you can take a joke, can't you?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose I can, yes.  Oh, wait!  I've got one.  Who do
             you suppose the monkey will get to defend him?  Clarence Darrow?
    _Everyone is stone silent and confused._
    **Frasier:** The Scopes Monkey trial...  You know, Darwin's theory of 
             evolution...  It was turned into a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
             novel, "Inherit the Wind." [_giving up, to a cop_] Is that 
             gun loaded?
    
    _Fade out._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier comes in the front door.  Daphne is sprawled on the couch, 
    red stains on her face and clothes.  Eddies is sitting on the table 
    above her, a gun in his mouth.  Martin comes out with a bottle of 
    ketchup and he and Daphne burst out laughing.  Frasier make a "Ha-ha" 
    face.
