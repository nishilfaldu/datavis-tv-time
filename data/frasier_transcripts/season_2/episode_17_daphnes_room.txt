    _ACT ONE_
    
    **TO GO BODLY WHERE 
    NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE**
    _Scene One -- Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier is searching the living room for a book.  He checks on the 
    shelf, and on the table and in the bookcase.  He calls out for help.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dad?
    _No answer._
    **Frasier:** Daphne?  Anybody home?
    _He soon realizes that nobody else is home.  He lifts the seat of the 
    piano stool to see if his book is inside, then sits down and begins to 
    play a Mozart tune on the piano.  
    
    Knowing no-one else will hear, he plays the opening chords of a Jerry 
    Lee Lewis classic, then the next ones, until suddenly:_
    **Frasier:** You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain!
             Too much love drives a man insane!
             Oh, what a thrill, just what a thrill!
             Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
    _Enjoying this rare moment to himself, he plays and signs with joyous 
    abandon, finishing with a ripple along the keys and a spin around on 
    his stool.
    
    However, when Niles and Martin walk in on him, he goes back to sedately
    playing the Mozart tune, as if he was playing it all along.  Martin and 
    Niles sit down._
    
     **Martin:**[_to Niles:_] I still think you're making too big a deal out
             of this!
      **Niles:** Dad, I have never seen Maris this angry.  I swear, her eye
             was twitching like a frog in a science experiment. 
     **Martin:** Well, when your mother'd get mad at me, I'd just grab her,
             bend her backwards, and give her a kiss which made her glad
             she was a woman!
      **Niles:** I can't do that with Maris.  She has abnormally rigid 
             vertebrae, she'd snap like a twig.
    **Frasier:** Let me guess, Maris has moved into the east wing again?
      **Niles:** Sunday was her fortieth birthday.  She said in no uncertain 
             terms she wanted no acknowledgement of it whatsoever, and 
             in a moment I live over and over in my dreams, I believed 
             her.
    **Frasier:** What, no gifts?  No party?  No nothing?
      **Niles:** Say that weeping into an ermine lap robe and you've got her
             down perfectly. 
     **Martin:** Oh, why don't you just get her a nice bottle of perfume?
      **Niles:** She gets hives.
     **Martin:** How about candy?
      **Niles:** Hypoglycemic.
     **Martin:** Just get her a dozen roses.
      **Niles:** Allergic.
    **Frasier:** Well listen Niles, why don't you just sit her down and have
             a little talk, tell her it was a mistake.  We've all noticed 
             she's a bit touchy about her age, even though it's not the 
             first time she's turned forty. [_Martin and Frasier laugh_]
      **Niles:** I know!  I'll throw a great big party for her this weekend.
             [_gets up and heads for the door_] It'll be a costume ball -- 
             with a Louis Quatorze theme, right down to the powdered wigs 
             and the crushed velvet pantaloons! [_brightly_] May I presume 
             you're both coming down with colds? 
    
    _Martin and Frasier give violent coughs._ 
    
      **Niles:** And so it goes. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Listen dad, you didn't happen to find a book lying around
             here?  The station manager loaned it to me and I promised I'd
             return it today.
     **Martin:** What's it called?
    **Frasier:**_The Life And Times Of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree._  It's a
             stunningly witty history of the English theatre.
     **Martin:**[_sarcastic:_] Oh OK, you caught me, I got it hidden under 
             my pillow!
    **Frasier:** Dad, you could at least try to be a little bit helpful, 
             I promised him I'd return it today. 
     **Martin:** Well, ask Daphne when she comes in.  She was looking for
             something too put her to sleep last night, that book sounds
             like it could put her into a coma.
    _Martin exits and Frasier is left alone.  After mulling it over in his 
    head he decides to go into Daphne's room and retrieve it.  
    
    CUT TO: Daphne's Room
    This room was once Frasier's study, but now shows unmistakable signs of 
    a woman's touch.
    
    He enters cautiously, being careful not to knock anything over.  He 
    picks up the book and is just about to leave when something catches his 
    eye.  He sees that Daphne has kept a lot of photos on her cabinet. 
    
    He picks one up to look at it more closely: it is Daphne with Prince 
    Charles.
    
    He has a look at some trinkets before moving to the other side of the 
    room.  He picks up an alarm clock in the shape of a "Teletubby" and 
    shakes it a little.  Spotting a bottle of pills he picks them up and 
    moves over to the light so he can read the label.  
    
    At that moment Daphne walks in, and Frasier hastily puts them out of 
    view into his pocket._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane!
    **Frasier:** Daphne.
     **Daphne:** What are you doing in my room?
    **Frasier:** Look, I thought you were out... not that I make a habit of
             coming in here when you're out!  Well, I thought I came in to
             get my book which I have, see. [_laughs nervously_] Well, I'll
             just be going - me and my book.  See Frasier go. [_exits_]
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Apartment.
    That evening, Niles is on the phone to Maris at Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier and Martin are sitting at the dinner table._
    
      **Niles:**[_into phone:_] Nadia, you tell Mrs. Crane I want to speak to
             her and don't take no for an answer! 
    _As he waits, he winks at Frasier and Martin._
      **Niles:**[_firm_] Well then Nadia, you tell her that Dr. Crane says... 
             [_ducks behind the stereo cabinet and lowers his voice_] 
             Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, 
             please, please, please... 
    
    _Frasier and Martin trade a look.  Niles puts the phone down._
    
     **Martin:** Maris hung up on you, huh?
      **Niles:** No, now she's got Nadia doing her dirty work.  Nadia is 
             Maris's hatchet maid. 
     **Martin:** What happened to that Louis the French guy birthday party?
      **Niles:** Disaster there too!  Maris reminded me that an entire branch
             of her family tree were slaughtered by the Huguenots.
    **Frasier:** Well, let's just forget about Maris for the time being,
             shall we?  Sit down and have a nice meal in a convivial
             atmosphere.
    _Daphne walks in with a lump of cold meat on a board.  She slams it
    down in front of Frasier and walks out again._ 
    
      **Niles:** What is she mad about?
     **Martin:** Beats me!
     **Daphne:**[_entering with onions and carrots:_] Here's your favorite,
             Mr. Crane, cream onions. [_hands them to Martin_] And, Dr.
             Crane, I've made my special glazed carrots just for you.
      **Niles:** Thank you. [_takes them from her_]
     **Daphne:**[_to Frasier:_] You.  Carve! [_she stabs a knife into the meat_]
     **Martin:** Well, we don't know what she's mad at, but we sure as hell
             know who!
     **Daphne:** If anyone needs me, I'll be eating in my room. [_to Frasier:_]
             You know where that is! [_exits_]
     **Martin:** What did you do?
    **Frasier:** This morning, I went into her bedroom. 
      **Niles:**[_shocked:_] Frasier, how could you?!  No matter how irresistible 
             the urge to venture down that hallway... to press your face 
             against that door... [_trailing off:_] to actually feel the 
             grain of the wood against your cheek... It must be fought!  
             It must be fought-
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles!  I simply went in there to retrieve my book.
     **Martin:** You're not supposed to go in there!
    **Frasier:**[_defensive_] Oh, what's the big deal?
     **Martin:** Do you ever see her leave her door open?  She doesn't like
             people going in there.
    **Frasier:** She goes into my room all the time, and it doesn't bother me!
     **Martin:** Women are different.
    **Frasier:** Dad, that is sexism talking.
     **Martin:** No, that's thirty-five years of marriage talking.  Women
             protect their privacy.  You know how they are about their
             handbags.  You never go in there!  It's always "bring me my 
             purse."  The husband could say, "honey, I'm being robbed, the 
             guy's holding a gun to my head and I don't have any money,"
             the wife'd say, "bring me my purse." 
      **Niles:** Dad, as usual, your simple homespun wisdom has pricked the
             balloon of Frasier's pomposity.
     **Martin:**[_to Frasier:_] Now you were wrong, so go on in there and
             apologize.  Go on!
    **Frasier:** Alright!  I'll go into Daphne's room and I will apologize to
             her. 
    
    _He gets up, Niles gets up and follows him._
    
    **Frasier:** Alone, Niles!
    
    _CUT TO: Daphne's Room.
    Daphne is eating her dinner at her desk.  There is a knock at the door._
     **Daphne:**[_nicely:_] Yes.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, it's Dr. Crane. 
     **Daphne:**[_angry:_] Yes!
    **Frasier:** Could you open the door, please? 
    _CUT TO: Hallway.
    Frasier stands outside the door.  Daphne opens the door a crack 
    and stares straight at him, even worse than Eddie._
    **Frasier:** I, I behaved very insensitively this morning.  And I did 
             need the book but it was wrong of me to go in without your
             permission. 
    
    _She just stares._ 
    
    **Frasier:** And I'm sorry. 
    
    _She stares without saying a single word._
    
    **Frasier:** It'll never happen again. 
    
    _She stares._
    
    **Frasier:** Ever. 
    
    _She stares._ 
    
    **Frasier:** I'm being very nice. 
    
    _She stares._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, good night Daphne. [_begins to leave_]
     **Daphne:**[_coming out:_] Oh, wait, I'm being much too hard on you! 
             I'm just a little sensitive about my privacy.
    **Frasier:** Oh, there's no need to explain.  I promise you, it will never
             be an issue again!
     **Daphne:** Well, thank you for being so understanding.  I suppose my
             problem goes back to growing up in a household of boys.  
             My brothers were all snoops.  They never gave me a moment's
             peace.  Oh, it was a filthy little rite of passage for the
             Moon boys: when I reached a certain age, they'd sneak into
             the bathroom and peek at me in the shower. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, dear God!  All eight of them?
     **Daphne:** Well, except for my brother Billy, the ballroom dancer.  
             He never peeked at me.  Though he did peek at my brother 
             Nigel.
    _Thinking about it, she exits to her room.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **INDIANA CRANE
    AND THE
    DISPOSAL OF DOOM**
    _Scene Three -- Kitchen.
    Later that evening, Frasier is making coffee as Martin enters._
    
    **Frasier:** Coffee, dad?
     **Martin:** Why not?  I'm up six times a night anyway, I might as well be
             alert! 
    _Frasier pours beans into the coffee grinder.  Niles comes in with some 
    dishes.  Martin switches on the disposal unit.  There's a hum indicating 
    it's jammed._
    
     **Martin:** Oh geez, the disposal's jammed! [_to Niles:_] Yeah, stick 
             your hand down there, see what's stuck, will ya?
      **Niles:** Dad, it's me, Niles. 
     **Martin:** I can't get my hand in there.
      **Niles:** Oh alright, punish a man for being fine-boned.  Are you sure
             it's off?
     **Martin:** Positive. [_reaches toward the switch to demonstrate_]
      **Niles:** Ah-ah-ah!  Move away from the switch!
     **Martin:** Oh, geez...
    _He moves to the other side of the kitchen.  Niles puts his hand down 
    into the unit._
      **Niles:** Oh-ho, it's wet and slimy and God knows what, it's like 
             sticking my hand into the mouth of hell...
    _Frasier switches on the coffee grinder, creating a high-pitched buzzing 
    noise._
      **Niles:** YAAAH!
    _Niles's hand shoots out of the garbage disposal with such force (or 
    little force knowing Niles) that he falls back onto the counter, 
    knocking over Frasier's silver coffee service.
    
    Realizing where the sound came from, he gets to his feet as if nothing 
    has happened (after checking his hand)._
    
    [_N.B. In an earlier draft, Niles holds up his hand while shielding his 
    eyes and yelping for someone to count his fingers._]
    
     **Martin:** Give me a call when the coffee's ready.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  
    _Martin exits._
    **Frasier:** Sorry, Niles. [_going to pick up the service_] Thank God.
      **Niles:** That's enough excitement for one evening, I'm going home to
             Maris.
    **Frasier:** I thought she wasn't speaking to you.
      **Niles:** She's not, but she grows weary of being frosty to the help.
    _RESET TO: Living Room_
      **Niles:** Oh, by the way I'm out of cash, I need something to tip your
             garage attendant.
    **Frasier:**[_searches pockets and finds the pill bottle_] Oh, great!
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** These pills!
      **Niles:** I was thinking money but you know him better than I do. 
    **Frasier:** No, [_hands Niles a dollar bill_] Daphne's prescription. 
             When I was in her room earlier, I must have inadvertently...
             [_thinks_] knocked them into my pocket.
      **Niles:** That's an interesting phenomenon.  I can't walk through a drug 
             store without aspirin and decongestant leaping into my 
             trousers!
    **Frasier:** OK, I was snooping around a little bit. [_he reads the label_]
             Oh, dear God!  "Take one before bedtime."  Oh no, she's sure 
             to miss these tonight.
     **Daphne:**[_entering with exercise mat_] Oh, you heading off, Dr. Crane? 
      **Niles:** Yes, I am.
     **Daphne:** Say hello to your wife. 
      **Niles:** I'll certainly try. 
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, time for your exercises! [_leaves to Martin's
             room_]
    **Frasier:** Oh great, this is my chance.  I'll just sneak back there and
             put these back in her room. 
    
    _He heads to the hallway, Niles again follows him._
    
    **Frasier:** Alone, Niles! 
    _Frasier goes to enter her bedroom.  As he does so, Daphne and Martin
    argue off stage.  Frasier carries on._
    
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] The Sonics game's on!  I'll do my exercises tomorrow.
     **Daphne:**[_o.s._] Fine!  If you need me I'll be in my room. 
    _Frasier has just put the pills down, now he can't escape.  He looks for 
    some place to hide, he looks out of the window but it's too far down.  
    He realizes he can't get under the bed so he hides in the wardrobe 
    closet.  Daphne re-enters, calling over her shoulder._
    
     **Daphne:** You're doing a double set tomorrow!
     **Martin:**[_o.s._] Yeah, yeah...
    _Daphne enters her room and closes the door._
     **Daphne:** Grumpy old sod...
    _Daphne goes into her bathroom to wash her hands.  Frasier walks out of 
    the wardrobe and heads for the door, but Daphne walks back in, making 
    Frasier rush back into the wardrobe.  Through the slats in the closet 
    door he can see into the room.
    
    Daphne then begins humming "The Blue Danube" as she does her routine. 
    She swallows one of her pills with a glass of water, then begins to 
    undress.  
    
    Frasier, mortified, turns away as she takes her underwear off and 
    slings them into the cupboard.  She reaches her hand in, searching for 
    something, so Frasier hurries up the process by passing over her 
    dressing gown.  She puts this on whilst Frasier closes the wardrobe 
    door.  
    
    Daphne goes to shut the wardrobe door and sees it already is.  She just 
    thinks she already closed it.  Then she heads for the bathroom, so 
    Frasier again tries to head to the door.  However, Daphne comes out 
    again so he ducks behind the bed.  She moves over to that side of the 
    bed, so he runs over to the other side, where she doesn't notice him. 
    
    After putting her eye drops in and untying her hair she heads to the 
    wardrobe to take out some towels.  Frasier hurries off into the 
    bathroom out of sight.  With the towels, Daphne waddles into the 
    bathroom, still humming.  Frasier is hiding behind the door, as Daphne 
    disrobes herself and gets into the shower.  Eddie comes running in and 
    begins drinking from the toilet.  Daphne sees him._
    
     **Daphne:**[_to Eddie:_] What are you doing?  It's disgusting, 
             you filthy thing.  
    _Frasier is horrified, thinking she's seen him._
     **Daphne:** Get out of here right now, get out!
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I'm so sorry!
    
    _Daphne SCREAMS loudly, causing Frasier to run out, also screaming.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Caf e Nervosa
    The following day, Frasier is sat at a table.  Niles prances in, 
    a little bit full of himself because of some events the night before 
    in the Maris Mansion._
    
      **Niles:** Good morning, Frasier!
    
    _Niles snags a passing waitress._
    
      **Niles:**_Cara mia, uno mezzo latte decaffinato_ , and a bran muffin.  
             No, no... [_kisses her hand_] _due_ bran muffins. [_to Frasier_] 
             Maris and I burned up a lot of energy last night - [_gleefully_] 
             a LOT of energy! -- and I have to replenish my body. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** I assume you and Maris achieved detente.
      **Niles:** Twice!
    **Frasier:** What magic words did you use to melt your little glacier?
      **Niles:** I got home, I sat her down, I stared deeply into her eyes...
             and I said, "Maris, here are the keys to your new Mercedes."
    **Frasier:** You bought her a Mercedes?
      **Niles:**[_happily_] Yes -- oh, the things that tiny woman can do when 
             she's properly motivated.
    **Frasier:** If you're through marinating in your own testosterone, I have 
             a problem.  Remember last night I went back into Daphne's 
             room?  Well, she caught me again.
      **Niles:** You're joking!
    **Frasier:** I was just so embarrassed I had to leave this morning before
             she woke up.  I left a little note, trying to explain my 
             actions.  Considering the circumstances, I don't think there's 
             any way she can forgive me!
      **Niles:** Oh, come now.  It wasn't as bad as all that.  It's not like 
             you saw her naked or something.
    
    _Frasier looks at his feet, Niles can't believe it._ 
      
      **Niles:** You did!
    **Frasier:** But I took no pleasure in it at all!  The entire thing was
             just absolutely mortifying!
      **Niles:** Frasier, I want to help you with this, so you have to tell me 
             everything.  Every sight, every sound -- Frasier, unburden 
             yourself before you explode! [_he says about to explode          
             himself_]
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, no!
    _Niles takes out a pen and grabs a napkin._
      **Niles:** Alright then, I'll show you how I've always imagined her 
             and you tell me where I'm wrong!
    _Frasier pushes away the napkin as Roz arrives and sits with both of them._
        **Roz:** Hey, guys!
    **Frasier:** Hi, Roz.  
      **Niles:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Good to see you.
    
    _As Roz sits between them, she senses something from Niles._
    
        **Roz:** So Niles, you randy dog, you got lucky last night, didn't you? 
             [_Niles reacts_] I can always tell. [_looks at Frasier_] Oh, don't 
             worry, you'll meet somebody. [_to waitress_] Can I have a non-
             fat cap, please?
      **Niles:** Roz, this was a private conversation, I'm helping my brother
             with a matter of some delicacy.
        **Roz:** Don't worry, Shower Boy told me all about it. 
    **Frasier:** I just don't see that there's any way I can make it up to 
             Daphne.
      **Niles:** Well, nothing says I'm sorry like a in-dash CD player and a
             passenger side airbag!
    **Frasier:**[_to Roz:_] Maris was upset with Niles so he bought her a
             Mercedes. 
        **Roz:** Woof!
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles:_] And if you're suggesting that I buy my way out
             of my problem, the answer is no!  It's the coward's way out!
      **Niles:** Oh, so I'm a coward?
    **Frasier:** Yes!
      **Niles:** Well, I'm a coward with a hickey!
        **Roz:** Buy me a Mercedes and I'll make your neck look like a
             relief map of the Andes. 
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, don't encourage him, I happen to think that bribery
             is the wrong way for couples to resolve their conflicts!
      **Niles:** Oh really, and during which of your failed marriages did you
             hone that theory?!
    _Niles and Frasier argue over this as Roz laughs, until it FADES OUT._
    **PEACE AT ANY COST**
    _Scene Five -- Apartment -- Night.
    In Frasier's living room, Martin needs some advice as Frasier comes in
    the front door._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm glad to see you.  I need some advice.  
             I've got this son who's a total numbnut. 
    **Frasier:** Hello, dad.  Love your icebreaker!
     **Martin:** You'd better get her to stay, Frasier.  She knows my moods,
             she's knows how to handle me, and I like her.
    **Frasier:** She's talking about quitting?
     **Martin:** Yes, so get in there and apologize!
    **Frasier:** Oh dad, I can't go in there!
     **Martin:** No, of course you can't, because I asked you to go in there.
             When I said, "don't go in there" what did you do?  You went in
             there.  Now I say go in there and you won't!  That's what I
             like about Eddie, he always does what I tell him to.  Come on,
             Eddie. 
    _As Martin exits, Eddie tries to follow him, but Frasier holds him 
    by the tail._
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] He's defying you too, dad! 
    _Daphne has entered without Frasier noticing.  When he does, she makes 
    a beeline for the door._
    **Frasier:** Daphne, Daphne, please, please wait, we've gotta talk.  I feel
             absolutely terrible.
     **Daphne:**[_sympathetic_] Oh, now, Dr. Crane, your note explained
             everything, you've got nothing to feel bad about.
    **Frasier:** That puts my mind at ease.
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastic_] A servant like me doesn't deserve privacy
             anyway!  Matter of fact, why don't we just get it all out in
             the open? 
    _Daphne throws her bag's contents onto the table._
     **Daphne:** Here's my bank book, some personal letters, oh and my
             driver's license.  As you can see, I'm four pounds heavier
             now, but it's in a spot that doesn't really show... TO MOST
             PEOPLE!
    **Frasier:** Oh look, Daphne, I realize how hard it is to live in someone
             else's home.
     **Daphne:** Yes, it is!  But I put up with it, because I happen to
             love this job.  All I ever asked for was one room, a
             little corner I could call my own.  I never minded if 
             I was up to my eyeballs in your precious earth tones 
             and your African knick-knacks, but now I have to put 
             up with you in there, too.  And that's one leering 
             love god too many! 
    **Frasier:** Oh Daphne, you're absolutely right, you do deserve a place
             of your own.  Listen if you agree to stay, [_desperate:_] I'll
             I'll have your room redecorated.  Just make it your own.
             Paint, wallpaper, upholstery, anything you'd like.  Just so
             you feel comfortable. 
     **Daphne:** How about an electrified fence and a German police dog?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I promise, as long as we live under the same roof
             together, I will never ever set foot in your room again.
     **Daphne:**[_pauses_] Alright.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
     **Daphne:** I'll give it another try. 
    _The doorbell sounds, Daphne answers it to Niles._
      **Niles:** Hello, all.
    **Frasier:** Ah, Niles!
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane. [_to Frasier_] Goodbye, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Oh, where are you off to?
     **Daphne:** I have some shopping to do.  Your brother just offered to
             pay to have my room re-decorated. 
      **Niles:**[_slyly:_] Oh, really?
     **Daphne:** I'm thinking of doing the whole thing in pinks and yellows.
    _She exits._
    **Frasier:** Dear God, she's really determined to keep me out of there.
      **Niles:** So, you're putting things right with Daphne by opening up
             your checkbook?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I know what you're thinking, and believe me, it's just a
             gesture. 
    _He pours sherries for himself and Niles._
      **Niles:** Oh, I see.  I give Maris a car, it's a bribe.  When you 
             re-decorate Daphne's room, it's a gesture.
    **Frasier:** Niles, our two situations are entirely different.  You bought
             Maris off because you are afraid of her.
      **Niles:** Oh I see, and you're not the slightest bit intimidated by
             Daphne?
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** Then you wouldn't be at all alarmed if I were to, say, 
             do this. [_runs to the hallway_] 
    **Frasier:** But... Niles!  Niles, where are you going?
    _CUT TO: Hallway
    Niles runs up to the corridor outside Daphne's room and opens the door.  
    He puts his foot over the door line._ 
      **Niles:** Oh look, my foot's in Daphne's room.
    **Frasier:** Just get out of there.
      **Niles:**[_pulls his foot back_] What's the matter?  Are you afraid 
             you'll get... [_jumps across the threshold_] in trouble? 
    **Frasier:** Niles...
      **Niles:**[_jumps back out_] Now we're safe.
    **Frasier:** Oh, stop it!
      **Niles:**[_in_] Trouble. [_out_] Safe. [_in_] Trouble. [_out_] Safe. 
    **Frasier:** Niles, you're acting like a child!
      **Niles:**[_more rapidly_] Trouble, safe, trouble, safe, trouble, safe!
    _Frasier is getting extremely hot under the collar because of this.  
    He tries to stop him, until Niles knocks over Daphne's jewelry tree, 
    spilling her necklaces and earrings all over the carpet._ 
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, no!  You see what you've done now!  She's bound to
             find out! 
      **Niles:** Well, [_snooping around_] so you'll just write her a bigger,
             fatter check. 
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, she'll quit!
      **Niles:** WHAT?!  Why didn't you say something-
    _Turning around in shock, Niles spills his sherry on the bed, causing 
    them both to panic further.  
    
    Niles grabs a towel from the bottom of a pile of Daphne's laundry,
    scattering it everywhere, and looking for more things to cover the
    stain.  He ends up in Daphne's underwear and nightie drawer, and 
    starts flinging her under-clothes onto the bed.
    
    Martin comes in to see what the upset is, and Eddie follows him._
     **Martin:** What the hell are you two doing in here?!
    **Frasier:** It's all Niles's fault!
      **Niles:** It is not!
    **Frasier:** Never mind, just help us clean up this mess!
    _Martin falls onto the bed trying to mop up the sherry, and Niles, 
    who is still throwing underwear, throws it on Martin. 
    
    Daphne appears in the doorway and freezes as she takes in the scene 
    along with the camera: 
    - Frasier on the floor, pawing through her jewelry
    - Martin on her bed underneath her lingerie
    - Niles shielding himself from her stare with one of her nighties
    - Eddie sitting up with one of her bras in his teeth
    
    FADE TO: 
    
    Scene Six -- Car Dealership Lot
    It isn't long before Daphne and Frasier are at a car salesroom.  
    Daphne is sitting inside a large blue Mustang convertible, wearing 
    a head scarf similar to Louise's from "Thelma and Louise."  Eddie 
    is sitting in the passenger seat.
    _
     **Daphne:**[_as the hood retracts, happily_] Oooooh!
    **Frasier:** Daphne, did you happen to see that sporty little sub-compact
             over there?  I bet you could park that anywhere.
    _Daphne rises in her seat and peers over the windscreen._
     **Daphne:** Is that a Mercedes dealership across the street? 
    _Frasier pushes her back down.
    
    END OF ACT TWO (Time: 21:30)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Daphne enters her room, now a little bit paranoid.  She checks to see 
    if anyone's lurking in the bathroom, then checks under the bed, and she 
    also makes sure no-one's in the wardrobe.  Just as she's about to 
    shower she spots something under the towels on her bed; it's Eddie.  
    She shouts at him and he runs out at once._
