## Premise

    
    
     When Daphne's love life is in a rut, Frasier acts as a matchmaker
     and brings his new boss, Tom, to his apartment to try and put him
     with Daphne.  There's just one catch Frasier doesn't realise; Tom's
     gay and is interested in Frasier.

## Reviews

    
    
    **Matthew Barr:**
     Keenan's first outing (no pun intended) sets the record straight (no
     pun intended) that Frasier's second season can hold up to the first.
     After some lacklustre episodes, this episode begins Keenan's
     tradition of farce that will continue to "The Two Mrs. Cranes" and
     "The Ski Lodge." Very well acted, with some great lines ("The Perils
     of Refinement," "If I could pick any man for Daphne, he's the one
     I'd pick," etc.), the only slow parts were the beginning which could
     have had more of an impact.  Still, watch this episode for a gay old
     time!
    **Grade: B+**
    
    **Michael Lee:**
     This episode deserves special mention for two reasons: first, it marks 
     the beginning of Joe Keenan's tenure with "Frasier," and a herald of 
     some of the show's all-time funniest episodes.  Second, it was a 
     landmark in and of itself, and won a special award from GLAAD (the Gay 
     and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), in recognition of the 
     difficulty of introducing gay humor into a mainstream comedy show 
     without conforming to stereotypes.  This is a challenge even for 
     writers who are gay themselves, and Keenan succeeds brilliantly.  
     The misunderstanding he sets up for the premise is perfectly credible, 
     and Keenan hits several existing assumptions without relying on them 
     to keep the plot going.  With this episode, "Frasier" (and Keenan) 
     broke new ground and proved some important things, without which later 
     shows like "Will & Grace" would not have been tried.

    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Apartment -- Night
    It's late at night and everyone is fast asleep in the Crane household. 
    Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off. 
    
    Martin and Frasier come running out in their sleepwear, panicking. 
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh my God!  Fire!
     **Martin:** Eddie!  Eddie!  Where are you, boy?
    **Frasier:** Dad, wake up!  Dad, are you in there?
     **Martin:** Eddie!  Here, Eddie!  Come on!
    **Frasier:** Dad, where are you?  Where's the fire?
    _Frasier turns the lights on._
     **Martin:** Have you seen Eddie? 
    **Frasier:** What's burning?  Where's the fire?
     **Martin:** Eddie!
    _Then Daphne comes running out in her nightie._
     **Daphne:** It's alright, it's alright!  False alarm!  The one above 
             my bed went off.
    _Frasier and Martin sag, breathing heavily._
    **Frasier:** Thank God!
     **Daphne:** Oh, and don't worry about Eddie - he's back in my room.  
             God, the noise the bloody thing makes!  It would be less 
             upsetting just to wake up on fire! 
     **Martin:** What the hell triggered it?
     **Daphne:** Who knows?  I was dozing quite peacefully when it started
             screaming away for no reason at all.
    _Eddie runs in and jumps onto the chair with a packet of cigarettes 
    in his mouth._
    **Frasier:** I see. [_takes the packet_] What have we here?  Eddie, you've 
             been smoking in Daphne's bedroom, bad dog! 
     **Daphne:** I know, you have a no-smoking rule.  I'm sorry.  But every
             now and again I feel a bit tense and I find a ciggy can be 
             very soothing.
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, it's real soothing.  It only should be an hour
             before my heart stops fibrillating. [_exits_] 
    **Frasier:**[_reading clock_] Oh, it figures, 3 AM.  Of course this would
             happen the night before I have an early morning meeting!
    _He starts to exit, but notices Daphne sitting on the couch, depressed._
    **Frasier:** Daphne, aren't you going back to bed?
     **Daphne:** No.  I'll just sit up for a bit, I'm feeling a bit blue.
    **Frasier:** Anything you'd like to talk about?
     **Daphne:** No, you need your sleep, it's nothing important. [_he starts to 
             exit_] Just this feeling that my life's a gaping sinkhole and 
             I'm just marking time while the flower of my youth rots on the 
             vine. 
    **Frasier:**[_eager to escape_] Well, so long as you're sure. 
    _He starts to exit again, but then Daphne sinks back, giving off a truly 
    pathetic whine that is an obvious plea for help.  He has no choice but
    to come back._
    **Frasier:** I really wish you'd tell me about it.
     **Daphne:** Well, if you must know, it's my love life.
    **Frasier:** Really?  You've been seeing a man?
     **Daphne:** Only when I close my eyes and concentrate. 
    **Frasier:** Ah, I see.  You're going through a bit of a drought, eh?
     **Daphne:** No wonder.  The rare times I do go out, it's usually with
             your father.  People see us and assume I'm his daughter, or
             else his girlfriend.  Either way, it's like having my own
             personal can of stud repellant.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, I know how bleak these times can be.  But believe
             me, they will come to an end sooner or later.  I remember a
             time back in Boston when I was going through exactly what 
             you're going through now.  Just a week later I met a lovely 
             barmaid -- sophisticated, if a bit loquacious.  We fell madly 
             in love, we got engaged... [_realizes_] Of course, she left 
             me standing at the altar.  But the point is, I didn't give up.  
             I took my poor, battered heart and offered it to Lilith... 
             [_thinks, as Daphne lights a cigarette_] Who put it in her 
             little Cuisinart and hit the puree button!  But, I rebounded!  
             And look how far I've come... I'm divorced, lonely, and living 
             with my father.
    _Frasier takes Daphne's cigarette and takes a drag.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Cafe Nervosa
    The next day, Frasier is sitting at a table.  Roz comes in.
    _
        **Roz:** I figured I'd find you here!  You know, you missed your
             meeting with the new station manager.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, I completely forgot.
        **Roz:** God, you look like you've been ridden hard and put away wet.
    **Frasier:** I was up till all hours of the night with Daphne, competing
             to see which one of us had the most pathetic love life.  On
             the bright side, I won.
        **Roz:** Well, I know what your problems are.  What are Daphne's?
    **Frasier:** She's just having trouble finding men.
    _Roz opens her purse and holds up a little black book._
        **Roz:** Say no more!
    **Frasier:**[_trying to be tactful_] No, Roz, Roz, it's really not 
             necessary.  You do not have to donate one of your 
             boyfriends to Daphne. 
        **Roz:** Oh, come on, I'd be happy to.
    **Frasier:** But still, one hates to break up a collection.
    _He tries to get her to close the book, as Niles returns to the table
    with coffees for himself and Frasier._
      **Niles:**[_sitting down_] There we go - double espresso, and my mocha
             latte.  Do those chocolate shavings look any different to 
             you?
    **Frasier:** No.
      **Niles:** Well, they do to me.  I think they've switched to an inferior
             domestic brand. [_takes a sip and swishes them around like 
             wine_] Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm - waxy.
        **Roz:**[_finding a name_] Oh, here we go!  Sven Bachman, he's an 
             aerobics instructor.
    **Frasier:** I don't think so.
        **Roz:** Oh, this one's perfect!  Gunther Dietrich.  He's loads of fun,
             and he's a runway model. 
    **Frasier:** A German narcissist; now there's an appealing combination.
        **Roz:** Okay, okay, I'll keep looking.
      **Niles:** Looking for what?
        **Roz:** I'm helping Frasier find a man for Daphne.
    _Niles puts down his cup and adopts a bland expression and tone 
    that do nothing to hide his outrage._
      **Niles:**[_lightly_] What?
        **Roz:** Here we go!  He's a tennis instructor, and his name is Brick.
      **Niles:** Dear God, Frasier - Sven, Gunther, Brick?  Why not just lather
             Daphne up with baby oil and hurl her over the wall of a prison 
             yard?
        **Roz:** Excuse me, but I've dated all these guys.
      **Niles:** Well, where do you think I came up with the imagery?
    _This makes Roz really furious._
        **Roz:** Listen, you little titmouse-!
    _Niles's temper also flares._
    **Frasier:**[_coming between them_] Alright!  Niles: you are completely out 
             of line here.  And Roz: he does have a point.  You and Daphne 
             are entirely different kinds of women.  Whilst Daphne is very 
             shy and inexperienced, you are more... well, a lot more... 
             well, actually it's hard to find anyone who's more...
        **Roz:** Oh, I get it!  Not one man I've ever dated is good enough for
             Miss Daphne, is that what you're trying to say?
    **Frasier:** No, it's what I'm trying not to say, and you're not making it
             very easy.
        **Roz:**[_getting up_] Oh, I'm out of here.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz, please wait.
        **Roz:** Oh no, I can't stay, the fleet's in!
    _She storms out.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - KACL
    Frasier is doing his show, but waiting while a piercing tone sounds 
    over the air.  Frasier resumes when it finishes._
    **Frasier:** And this concludes our test of the emergency broadcast system.  
             Had this been a real emergency, your radio would be melting in 
             your hands.  We'll be right back after these messages. 
    _He goes to commercial.  Roz stalks in and slams a half-eaten donut 
    onto his console._
        **Roz:** In the future, please keep your disgusting half-eaten food
             off my console.  In fact, just stay out of my sight!
    **Frasier:** You're still mad at me, I can tell.
        **Roz:**[_nasty_] And there's that keen sensitivity that keeps you in 
             such demand with the ladies. 
    _She goes back into her booth, he follows her._
    **Frasier:** Look Roz, I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier.  But the truth 
             is, I feel very protective of Daphne.  See, the kind of man 
             I'm looking for has to be good-looking, smart, successful...
    _Behind Frasier, Tom Duran, the new station manager, enters the booth.
    He instantly seems to embody all the virtues Frasier enumerated._
        **Tom:** Excuse me.
    **Frasier:** Yes?
        **Tom:** I'm Tom Duran, the new station manager. 
    **Frasier:** Oh!  Tom, hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.  I'm so sorry
             about missing the meeting this morning, I slept right
             through it.
        **Tom:** Oh yeah me too, and I was there. 
    _Frasier laughs._
        **Tom:** Say, that's a beautiful tie.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you.  Yes, I got this one in London at one of those
             custom shops just of off Sloane Square. 
        **Tom:** You know, I just came from London.  I spent the last five
             years working for the BBC.
    **Frasier:** Really?  I love London - the museums, the theatre...
        **Tom:** Oh yeah, I'm a big theatre buff, three shows a week.  I hated
             leaving.
    **Frasier:** I can imagine.  Why did you?
        **Tom:** Well, I just kind of went through a messy break-up.  I thought
             I'd sleep better with a continent between us. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know the feeling! [_clicks_] So, I take it then you're
             unattached?
        **Tom:** Yes, but I haven't given up hope.
    **Frasier:** Well, you may have come to the right place.
        **Tom:** Really?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  You say you're very fond of the English?
        **Tom:** Oh yes, very much.  You know, I think I've always had a
             weakness for people who are just a little eccentric. 
    **Frasier:**[_now really interested_] Really?
        **Roz:** Fifteen seconds.
        **Tom:** Well, it was nice meeting you.
    **Frasier:** Likewise. 
    _Frasier sits at his console.  Tom starts to leave._
    **Frasier:** Uh, say Tom, this may sound like short notice, but if you're 
             not busy Saturday, why don't you come round my place for 
             dinner?  Nothing fancy.
        **Tom:** Well thanks, I'd like that. 
    **Frasier:** Great! 
    _Tom exits through the door and Frasier goes on the air._
    **Frasier:** Hello Seattle, we're back.  Roz, who do we have up next?
        **Roz:** We have James from Tacoma on line one. 
    **Frasier:** Hello James, I'm listening...
    _Tom walks down the hall and enters Roz's booth.  While Frasier is 
    engaged with his caller Roz gets up and starts checking the carts on 
    the wall.  They begin chatting about his fair Frasier._
        **Tom:** Hi, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hi, Tom.  How's it going?
        **Tom:** Well, you know, it's the same with every job I take.  The word
             flies like wild fire. 
        **Roz:** What's that?
        **Tom:** Oh, you know, you tell one or two people you're gay and before 
             you can blink it's all over the station. 
        **Roz:** Well, they don't call it "broadcasting" for nothing.
        **Tom:** He seems like a nice guy.
        **Roz:** Oh, he's OK.
        **Tom:** I hope he's more than OK, he just asked me out on a date.
    _As Roz turns around in surprise, Frasier notices Roz talking to Tom 
    and waves for her to stop._
        **Roz:** Frasier just asked you out on a date?
        **Tom:** Well, he asked me to his place for dinner.  So I wanted to ask
             you, is there any particular wine he likes?
        **Roz:** Listen Tom, there is something I think you need to know
             about Frasier...
        **Tom:** What? 
    _Frasier holds up a card: "HANDS OFF HE'S TAKEN!"_
        **Roz:** He's nuts about chardonnay.
        **Tom:** Thanks!
    _He leaves.  Roz shrugs innocently at Frasier.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THE PERILS OF REFINEMENT**
    _Scene Four -- Apartment
    Saturday evening, Frasier is setting up the apartment while a furious 
    Daphne is setting the table.
    _
     **Daphne:** Does he ask permission first?  Oh no, he just barges in and
             says he's set me up with God-knows-who, and I'm supposed to
             turn cartwheels like I'm bloody Cinderella.
    **Frasier:** Will you please relax?  Look, I told you, this is not a set-
             up.  Tom doesn't even know you'll be here.
     **Daphne:** Oh, an ambush then.  Much nicer!  My girlfriends in Manchester
             used to set me up all the time.  And it was always some
             gangly bounder with a boarding-house reach.  And he wasn't
             going for the Coleman's Hot Mustard, if you know what I
             mean!
    **Frasier:** Just keep in mind, Tom is just a co-worker who's coming by 
             for a pleasant little dinner.  If some sparks should ignite, 
             then fine, but there is no pressure, absolutely no pressure... 
             is that what you're wearing?
    _Daphne looks down at her fairly plain housedress._
     **Daphne:** Why, what's wrong with it? 
    _The doorbell rings._
    **Frasier:** Don't you have something with a little more oomph?  Oh, what 
             About that, that strapless number you have? [_motions down his 
             hips_]
     **Daphne:** Do you have any idea how uncomfortable a strapless bra is?
    **Frasier:** Well, thanks to my fraternity days, as a matter of fact I do!
    _He motions for Daphne to go and change, which she reluctantly does.  
    He opens the door to Tom, dressed in a casual suit and carrying a 
    bottle of wine._
    **Frasier:** Tom!  Come on in.
        **Tom:** Hi, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Good to see you.
        **Tom:**[_re: wine_] Oh, I don't know, something told me you 
             might like chardonnay.
    **Frasier:** Oh my, that's my favorite.  So, what do you think of this
             place?
        **Tom:**[_looking out the window_] That's a hell of a view!
    **Frasier:** It's even better from the bedroom.
    _Tom reacts to this, but Frasier doesn't realize._
        **Tom:** Why don't we just start with the drink?
    _Frasier laughs._
        **Tom:**[_re: dining table_] Oh, four places, who's joining us?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just my little household: my father and his charming 
             physical therapist, Daphne. 
        **Tom:** You live with your dad?  I can't even imagine that.  Well, I
             mean it's great that you get along so well, but doesn't, um...
             having him here put a crimp in your love life?
    **Frasier:** Oh, not at all.  Except when I bring my dates home, he tries
             to steal them.  
    _Tom reacts to this as well._
    **Frasier:** He's quite the old rascal!
    _Daphne enters in a short red strapless dress._
    **Frasier:** Well, look who we have here.  Tom, I'd like you to meet 
             Daphne.  Daphne this is Tom Duran.
        **Tom:**[_shaking hands_] Pleasure to meet you.
     **Daphne:** Likewise.  Oh, Dr. Crane, you didn't take his coat!
    **Frasier:** Oh, sorry.
     **Daphne:** May I?
    _Tom turns around.  As Daphne takes his coat, she turns to Frasier, 
    ecstatic, and mouths, "HE'S GORGEOUS!  THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"
    
    Frasier mouths back, "YOU LOOK FABULOUS!  YOU LOOK FABULOUS!"
    
    They stop as Tom turns round again.  She drapes the coat over her arm 
    and starts to carry it to the rack, then stops._
     **Daphne:** Oh, this is strange, I'm picking up a vibration from your
             coat.
        **Tom:** Excuse me?
    **Frasier:** Yes well, Daphne feels she possesses psychic powers - you
             know those English eccentrics. 
     **Daphne:**[_comes back and takes Tom's hand_] Oh, you've just been 
             through a very painful break-up, haven't you?
        **Tom:** Yes! [_then, to Frasier_] Oh, wait a minute, you told her that, 
             didn't you?
    **Frasier:** No, no.
     **Daphne:** There was a bitter dispute about ownership of opera 
             recordings.
        **Tom:**[_drops onto the couch_] Whoa!
    _Having made her mark, Daphne makes a graceful exit._
     **Daphne:** Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll nip into the kitchen.  I have a
             bird to baste. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Quite something, isn't she?
        **Tom:** Yeah, she's great.  I love hearing that accent again. 
     **Martin:**[_entering_] Hey Frasier, I don't have to put a tie on for this
             joker, do I? [_sees Tom_] 
    **Frasier:** Tom, this is my father, Martin Crane.
        **Tom:** Tom Duran, nice to meet you.  
     **Martin:**[_shaking hands_] I'm sorry about that "joker" business. 
             [_Tom waves it off_] I call everybody joker, jerk, pinhead, 
             bozo...
    **Frasier:** And amazingly he's free for dinner on short notice.  
             Why don't I just open some of this wonderful wine?
    _He goes into the kitchen, where he checks on Daphne's feelings._
    **Frasier:** Well?
     **Daphne:** Oh, he's a looker.  I'm glad you made me put on my lucky bra.
             He's worth every wire digging into my ribcage. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, you've made quite an impression on him too.  He thinks
             you're great! 
     **Daphne:** Oh, go on! [_giggles_] God, listen to me getting carried away 
             like a school girl when I've just met the man.  No, I'm not 
             raising my hopes tonight - though I'm glad I raised my bosom. 
    _Meanwhile, Martin and Tom are having a chat in the living room._
     **Martin:** Yeah, let me tell you, you're gonna love Seattle.  It's a real
             people place.  Great food, great bars...
        **Tom:** I've heard that.  Any you recommend?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I usually hang out at a place called Duke's.  Great
             crowd, lot of young cops. [_Tom is pleased_] So, do you like
             football?
        **Tom:** Yeah, yeah, I really missed it when I was living in London.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well maybe we can take you to see a Seahawks game
             sometime.  Frasier hates it, so it'd just be us.
        **Tom:** Hey, Frasier warned me about you!
     **Martin:** Yeah, I guess I yell at the players too loud. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:**[_entering_] Here we are, Tom. [_hands him wine_] Dad, I took
             the liberty of selecting an amusing little vintage for you
             too. [_hands him a Ballantine_] Sorry, I didn't bring the 
             pull-tab so you could sniff it. 
     **Martin:** Merci beaucoup. [_pronounces it "mercy bow-coop."_]
    _The doorbell sounds so Frasier goes to answer it.  Niles is standing
    there with a book._
      **Niles:** Hello, Frasier. [_takes Frasier's wine glass_] Oh, thank you.  
             I just stopped by to return your book. [_hands it over_]
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, thank you, well don't let me keep you. 
      **Niles:** Am I interrupting something?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact, I'm introducing a man to Daphne.
      **Niles:** Ah!  Guess you don't want me around then. [_walks in_] How
             do you do?  I'm Dr. Niles Crane.
        **Tom:** Hi, I'm Tom Duran. 
     **Daphne:**[_peeks out_] Bird's all done.  Now all I need is a pair of big
             strong arms to haul it out of the oven.
      **Niles:** Well, I certainly don't need to be asked twice. 
    _He quickly walks into the kitchen, to Daphne's disappointment and 
    Frasier's anger.
    
    END OF ACT ONE (Time: 14:10)
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Five - Apartment
    During dinner, Tom is telling a story about the queen in the middle 
    of an interview._
        **Tom:** So, halfway through the interview her stomach starts rumbling.  
             And her body mike's picking it up, but I have to ignore it.  
             Because what am I going to say; "Would her majesty care for 
             a Tums?" 
    _Everyone laughs - except Niles, who is being rather immature as usual._
     **Daphne:** I could listen to your stories all night.  They're so funny. 
      **Niles:** And all involving bodily functions.
     **Daphne:** Tom, I could use a little hand in the kitchen...
      **Niles:** No, no, sit Daphne, after all that cooking you must be...
             [_looks down her frock_] absolutely strapless.
    _Niles exits to the kitchen, leaving Daphne disappointed again.
    
    In the kitchen, Niles puts a few things into the sink.  Tom enters,
    slightly piqued._
        **Tom:** Er, Niles, can I speak with you for a moment?
      **Niles:** Yes. [_slaps down silverware_]
        **Tom:** I was wondering, did I do anything that offended you? 
      **Niles:** No. [_angrily throws pots into the sink_]
        **Tom:** Oh.  It must be all in my head, but I sensed that you had a
             problem with me dating Frasier.
      **Niles:**[_turns round_] Well, if you must know...
    _A twenty-second pause ensues while he wonders if his hearing is faulty._
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, what was the question?
        **Tom:**[_crosses his arms_] Do you have some problem with me 
             dating your brother?
    _Now Niles understands all, and becomes as serene as a Buddha._
      **Niles:**[_graciously_] No.
    **Frasier:**[_entering_] Now Niles, I didn't ask Tom to dinner so he could 
             talk with you all night in the kitchen.  There are others who 
             would like to have a crack at him! 
    _Frasier and Tom exit.  Niles just stands there with a small smile that 
    threatens to explode into hysterics.  Rocking slightly, he twirls once
    on his heel, as Martin enters with some plates._
     **Martin:** That Tom's a great guy, huh?  You think maybe him and
             Daphne...
    _Niles shakes his head, combining laughter with a negative "Mmm-mmm."
    
    On the balcony, Tom, Frasier and Daphne are having a little chat._
        **Tom:** You know, I can't remember the last time I had such a
             wonderful evening.
     **Daphne:** Oh no, we should be thanking you.  I can't remember when I've
             laughed so hard.
    _From inside the apartment they suddenly hear Martin roaring with 
    laughter.  They look and see him doubled over in the kitchen, while 
    Niles laughs along._
     **Daphne:** You've still got Mr. Crane going.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, I think a little after dinner music would be
             appropriate. 
     **Daphne:** Good idea. [_she goes to the stereo_]
    **Frasier:** She's, er, quite a woman, isn't she?
        **Tom:**[_flatly:_] Yes, she's really something, [_suggestive:_] 
             Um, Frasier, I was wondering.
    **Frasier:** Yes?
        **Tom:** Do you think before the evening's over we could get a little
             one-on-one time?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think I can arrange that. 
    _He goes inside while Daphne is putting on music.  They both whisper:_
    **Frasier:** Daphne!
     **Daphne:** Yes?
    **Frasier:** He says he wants to be alone with you!
     **Daphne:** No!
    **Frasier:** Yes!
     **Daphne:** This really is my lucky bra!  Keep the wine flowing, I'll go 
             fix my lipstick.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
    _She exits to her room.  Martin and Niles come back from the kitchen._
     **Martin:** Yeah, I guess I'd better be hitting the old sack.  Don't
             want to stand in the way of young romance! [_hides a grin_]
    **Frasier:** Thanks, dad.
     **Martin:** Goodnight, Tom.
        **Tom:** Goodnight, Martin. 
    _Martin exits to the hallway._
    **Frasier:** And Niles, isn't it time you were running along too?
      **Niles:** Yes, I must be on my way.  And, Frasier, I must apologise, 
             I was wrong about Tom.  If I had to choose a man for Daphne,
             he's the one I'd pick. 
    **Frasier:** Good. 
      **Niles:** Goodnight Tom, nice to meet you. 
        **Tom:** Goodnight.
      **Niles:** Frasier, a word in your ear? 
    _Surprised, Frasier motions "one second" to Tom, and follows Niles out 
    the front door into the corridor._
      **Niles:** There's something I have to tell you.  Dad wanted to but I
             won the coin toss. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, what is it?
      **Niles:** Well, I had a little chat with Tom in the kitchen and he
             told me he's interested in pursing a romantic relationship.
             But, the object of his affections is not Daphne.
    **Frasier:** Damn that Roz!
      **Niles:** No, no.  It's you.
    _Beat._
    **Frasier:** Me?  That's impossible, Tom's not gay!
      **Niles:** He seems to be under that impression. 
    **Frasier:** Well, what on earth could have made him think I was 
             interested in him?  All I did was ask him if he was 
             attached, and then we talked about the theatre and 
             men's fashions... [_clicks_] Oh my God!  Niles, do you 
             realise what this means?
      **Niles:** Yes, you're dating your boss.  You of all people should know
             the pitfalls of an office relationship.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but he... he just never mentioned the fact he...
      **Niles:**[_in elevator:_] I'll call you tomorrow.  But not too early, 
             of course. [_the doors close on Niles's laugh_]
    _Frasier, sweating like a pig and as red as a beetroot enters the room.  
    The romantic music that Daphne put on is playing.  Tom is lounging on 
    the couch, massaging his neck.  His glasses are off, and he casts a sly 
    look at Frasier that leaves no room for doubt._
        **Tom:** So...
    **Frasier:** So... God, I hate this song.
    _He runs over and turns the stereo off._
        **Tom:** You know, I've broken my rule for you.  I usually don't date
             guys I work with.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I've sort of relaxed my rule for you too. 
        **Tom:** You're cute when you're nervous.
    **Frasier:** I must be downright adorable now then.  Listen Tom, I'm 
             sorry, but we seem to have gotten our lines crossed here.
             The truth is I'm entirely straight.
        **Tom:**[_puts on his glasses_] Hey, if you're not interested just say 
             so.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, it's true, I really am.  I just invited you to dinner
             because you seemed so charming and you were so fond of the
             British, I thought you might be the perfect man for Daphne. 
    _Daphne enters from the hallway just in time to hear:_
        **Tom:** I can't believe this.  You really had no idea that I'm gay? 
    _Daphne stops, unclasps her not-so-lucky bra and walks back 
    to her bedroom, chucking the bra up in the air as she goes.  
    The two men stand in embarrassed silence for a moment._
    **Frasier:** Don't take this wrong, but it never even occurred to me you 
             might be gay.
        **Tom:** Well, it never even occurred to me that you might be straight.
    **Frasier:**[_uncertain_] Thank you.  Geez, Tom, I feel just awful. Seems 
             I've just been leading you on all night. 
        **Tom:**[_getting his coat_] Oh, it's OK.  It's an honest mistake.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but I've been pouring you drinks, building up your
             hopes, making you think you might have found a man
             sophisticated and sensitive enough to help you...
        **Tom:**[_amused_] Frasier, I'll learn to love again.
    **Frasier:**[_chuckles_] Yes, of course.
    _Tom goes to the door._
        **Tom:** You'll apologize to Daphne?
    **Frasier:** For the rest of my days.
        **Tom:**[_starts to leave, then_] Does this mean your dad's not gay 
             either?
    **Frasier:** No, no, dad's not gay.
        **Tom:**[_starts to leave again, then_] But Niles - come on! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:**[_smiles_] No, I'm afraid not.
        **Tom:** Huh... so wait a minute, this Maris guy he kept mentioning is 
             a woman?
    **Frasier:** Well, the jury's still out on that one. 
    _Tom grimaces and leaves, waving goodnight.
    
    END OF ACT TWO (Time: 21:16)_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier and Daphne are sitting up late at night, smoking and drinking
    cognac.  Frasier picks up the packet and reads the health warning and 
    ingredients list on the side.  He shows it to Daphne.  They stub out 
    their cigarettes immediately, then throw back the rest of their cognacs.
