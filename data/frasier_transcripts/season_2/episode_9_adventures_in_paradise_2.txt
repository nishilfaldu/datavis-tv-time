## Transcript {Mike Lee}

    
    
    _PROLOGUE_
    **A BRIEF RECAP BEFORE WE CONTINUE...**
    
    **Frasier:**[_v.o._] I just opened up the pages of "Seattle" magazine, 
             and there she was...
    _Clips from Scenes One and Four of Part I, in which Frasier meets 
    Madeline Marshall and then agrees to go away with her._
    **Frasier:**[_v.o._] So off I flew to Bora Bora, and did I receive the 
             shock of my life...
    _FADE TO:
    
    ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Bora Bora
    We're back where we left off -- Frasier and Lilith catching sight of 
    each other.
    _
     **Frasier:** Lilith!  What are you doing here?!
      **Lilith:** I suppose I could ask you the same thing.
    **Madeline:**[_o.s_] Frasier, is everything all right?
     **Frasier:** Uh, yes, yes.  Uh, why don't you come out and join us, 
              Madeline? [_to Lilith_] What about you?  Are you here with 
              someone?
      **Lilith:** Yes.  Actually, he's snorkeling at the moment.
     **Frasier:** Anyone I know?
      **Lilith:** Sam Malone.
     **Frasier:**_Sam?!_
      **Lilith:** Just kidding.
     **Frasier:** Of all places, Lilith, why did you bring him here?
      **Lilith:** Well, it was spectacular five years ago when you brought me, 
              it's even more breathtaking now.
     **Frasier:** But this was our place.  How could you bring someone else? 
              [_Madeline comes out in a robe_] Oh, here.  Lilith, I'd like 
              you to meet Madeline Marshall. [_they shake hands_] How's 
              this for a hoot?  This is my ex-wife, Lilith.
    **Madeline:** Your... ex-wife is here?
     **Frasier:** Yes.  It's a shame, too -- no papers to be signed.
    **Madeline:** So you're here with someone?
      **Lilith:** Why does everyone keep asking me that?  Yes, I am.  
              Oh, here he comes now.  Brian?
    _Brian -- a distinguished-looking man with iron-gray hair and a trim, 
    athletic physique -- walks on drying himself off.
    _
      **Lilith:** Dr. Brian Patchett, I'd like you to meet Madeline Marshall, 
              and Dr. Frasier Crane.
       **Brian:**[_shaking hands_] Your ex-husband?  You're making a joke!
      **Lilith:** No, God is.
       **Brian:** Pleasure to meet you.
     **Frasier:** Likewise.
      **Lilith:** Uh, Brian is a seismologist at M.I.T.
     **Frasier:** Oh well, that's perfect.  Brian being a seismologist, and 
              you having so many faults. [_Lilith laughs, surprising 
              Frasier_] Lilith, you're laughing!
      **Lilith:** Well, I laugh quite a bit these days, thanks to Brian.
     **Frasier:** Oh well, Madeline is just hilarious!  She also designs her 
              own line of sportswear.
      **Lilith:** I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever worn sportswear.
    **Madeline:** So, how long are you going to stay?
      **Lilith:** Until Tuesday. [_Brian puts his arm around her_]
     **Frasier:**[_putting his arm around Madeline_] We're here till Wednesday.
    _Lilith gives Brian a kiss.  Frasier does the same to Madeline.
    Suddenly, Lilith grabs Brian and kisses him deeply.  Frasier grabs 
    Madeline and kisses her deeply.  Both keep one eye open on the other._
       **Brian:** Well, this certainly has the potential to be very awkward.  
              Why don't we defuse the situation by getting together for 
              cocktails later?
    **Madeline:** Better yet, let's have dinner.
      **Lilith:** Oh, that's a wonderful idea.  Why don't we meet in the Tiki 
              Room -- at six o'clock?
    **Madeline:** Great.
     **Frasier:** Looking forward to it!  What a wonderful way to start out 
              what promises to be the greatest week of our lives!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Hotel Room
    Frasier and Madeline come back from dinner.  Frasier is fuming.
    _
     **Frasier:** You see how Mr. Perfect kept rubbing it in, just to get my 
              goat?
    **Madeline:** Frasier, relax.
     **Frasier:** Oh, like he had to climb that tree to get her a coconut -- 
              there were three of them on the ground!
    **Madeline:** Would you stop obsessing?  Come here.
     **Frasier:** O.K.
    _They lie down on the bed and embrace, kissing... then Frasier stops._
     **Frasier:** Hold it!  What's that?
    **Madeline:**[_whispering_] What's what?
     **Frasier:** Lilith is making love in there!
    **Madeline:** I don't hear a thing.
     **Frasier:** Exactly!
    **Madeline:** Would you just concentrate on me, please?!
     **Frasier:** Oh, you're right, you're right.  It's not like it was back 
              in college, when that sort of thing was going on in the 
              next room and I was left all alone with nothing but my 
              dreams and my Henry Miller collection.  You're right, 
              I just got to block it out of my mind, just try to focus 
              and concentrate on the task at hand!
    **Madeline:**[_sarcastic_] Oh, that's sexy.
     **Frasier:** You're right, forgive me.  You want sexy?  I'll show you 
              sexy.
    _He embraces her again._
    **Madeline:** I feel dirty.
     **Frasier:** Good!
    **Madeline:** No, no, I mean sandy, from sitting on the beach.  Just let 
              me take a shower.
     **Frasier:** O.K.  Don't be long!
    **Madeline:** When I come back, I'll make you forget you were ever 
              married to Lilith.
     **Frasier:** That's never happened before without a prescription!
    _Madeline goes into the bathroom.  Frasier takes off his shoes 
    and lies back on the bed._
    **Frasier:**[_relaxing_] Oh yeah, oh yeah. [_gets an idea and turns his 
             head toward the wall; louder_] Oh yeah... oh, it's never been 
             like this before, never! [_puts his ear to the wall_] Nothing -- 
             damn her, she can give as good as she gets! [_starts jumping 
             up and down on the bed_] Oh yeah, oh yeah!  Oh, oh, mama!  
             Oh God, you are so hot!  I am burning up!  Oh, that's it, 
             that's it!  Yes!  Yes!
    _Lilith and Brian, fully clothed, appear in the doorway; Madeline 
    comes out of the bathroom in a towel.  Not noticing them, Frasier 
    grabs the bed's canopy and rocks it so it slams against the wall._
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, yes!  Keep it up, baby!  You're killing me!  
             Oh God, you're an animal!  YES, YES!
    _He sees them and stops.  Lilith turns to Brian and shrugs helplessly._
    **Madeline:** Well, obviously you don't need me!
    _FADE TO:_
    **PARADISE LOST**
    _Scene Three -- KACL
    Frasier is back doing his show.
    _
    **Frasier:** Well, before we go to our "Eye in the Sky" Chopper Dave for 
             the traffic report, I would like to send this confidential 
             message to Madeline M.  Madeline, I'm sure your gentleman 
             would love an opportunity to explain his behavior, but you 
             left the island before he had a chance, and, um, you won't 
             return his calls or answer the notes he's sent.  We all know 
             how hard it is to find love in this world, what a tragedy it 
             is to let it slip through our fingers.  I think he really 
             cares about you. [_Roz taps on the glass_] This is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane, we'll be back in a moment.
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes in._
        **Roz:** Frasier, you were wonderful.
    **Frasier:** You really think she'll call?
        **Roz:** If the woman doesn't respond, she doesn't have a heart.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, I almost forgot!  This bill came for you from your hotel 
             in Bora Bora.
    **Frasier:**[_reading it_] Well, it's not too bad.  I guess they had to 
             charge me for the whole week.
        **Roz:** No, that's for the bed you trashed.
    **Frasier:** Twenty-five hundred dollars for bamboo?!
    _Roz goes back into her booth and signals him to go back on._
    **Frasier:** Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Roz, whom do we have next?
        **Roz:** We have Vic from Seattle on line three.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Vic.  I'm listening.
        **Vic:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane, thanks for taking my call.  I'm a 
             first-time caller, I'm a little nervous.
    **Frasier:** Oh, just relax, Vic -- "I'm listening."
        **Vic:** Yeah, I'm really having a problem with women...
        **Roz:**[_sticking her head in; whispering_] Frasier, Madeline's on 
             line one!
        **Vic:** Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** Oh, uh-uh, Vic, uh, something's come up in the booth, just-
             you know, I'll have to turn you over to my very capable 
             producer.
        **Vic:** Uh, O.K.
    _Roz, panicking, mouths "WHAT?!  NO, NO!"  Frasier ignores her and picks 
    up the phone._
    **Frasier:** Madeline, Madeline, hi!  Oh, thanks for calling.  Oh, no, 
             no, it's OK, it's OK, I'm off the air right now.
    _Roz decides to give it a shot._
        **Roz:** So, Vic, uh, what's this trouble you're having with women?
        **Vic:** I don't know.  You know, I have a good job, I think I have 
             a good personality.  'Course, I made more money when I was 
             modeling, but I'm doing O.K. at the law firm.
        **Roz:**[_Bye-bye panic!_] Tell me more.
    _Scene Four -- Apartment
    Daphne, Martin, and Niles are dressed for an evening out.
    _
       **Niles:** Maris will be thrilled you're coming to see her tonight in 
              the ballet.
      **Daphne:** Oh, we're delighted!
      **Martin:**[_mumbling_] Yeah.
      **Daphne:** You know, when I was younger I dreamed of being a ballerina 
              myself.
       **Niles:** So did Maris!  But the poor thing could never get her weight 
              up enough.  That's why I couldn't help myself at the ballet 
              fundraiser when they auctioned off this walk-on part.  It was 
              the perfect gift for my Maris!
      **Martin:** So Maris is gonna be a ballerina?
       **Niles:** No.  It's non-dancing, but it is a key role, Dad.  She plays 
              Ulrich, the hunchbacked drawbridge operator.
      **Martin:** I hope we can pick her out.
    _Frasier comes in._
     **Frasier:** What are you people still doing here?
      **Daphne:** Oh, hush, we'll be long gone before your lady friend gets 
              here.
     **Frasier:** Well, you don't want to be late for the ballet.
      **Martin:** I do!  When those ballet guys start flying around in those 
              tight pants, I don't know where to look!
      **Daphne:** Oh, that reminds me, I've got to bring my binoculars.
     **Frasier:** Will you just get out of here?!
       **Niles:** Frasier, will you relax?
     **Frasier:** I can't, it's my last chance with Madeline!  Serves me 
              right, too, after the way I behaved in Bora Bora.
       **Niles:** You're being too hard on yourself, it was just bad luck.  
              How were you to know that Lilith had arrived on the island?
      **Martin:** Aside from the seas starting to churn and all the birds 
              taking flight from the trees.
      **Daphne:** Oh now, don't you worry, Dr. Crane.  Miss Marshall's going 
              to forgive you.  Women always appreciate a man who's 
              sensitive enough to try again.  That's why they call us the 
              "fair sex."  All right then, let's go see some leaping 
              Russian stags!
    _As they head out the door, they run into Madeline coming in._
      **Martin:** Oh hi, Maddy!
      **Daphne:** Oh, hello!  We were just leaving for the ballet.
     **Frasier:** Madeline, come in.
       **Niles:** You two kids take your time.  Don't worry about us, we'll be 
              out all evening.
      **Martin:** Yeah, you know how it is.  First the ballet, then the 
              inevitable discussion.
    _They leave._
     **Frasier:** Well, that was a little awkward.
    **Madeline:** So is this.
     **Frasier:** I guess there's no delaying it.  I might as well just launch 
              into my little speech, try to explain why I behaved the way 
              I did... 
    **Madeline:** You know what might be better?  If I tell you how I've got it 
              worked out.  The minute you saw Lilith, you wanted to leave, 
              but I wouldn't let you.  You said you couldn't handle it, and 
              by God, you were right!  You panicked, and your panic took a 
              bad turn -- a spectacularly bad turn.  Anyway, that's how I've 
              got it worked out in my head, and it's fragile, so let's not 
              mess with it.  So, why don't you mix up a pitcher of Mai-
              Tai's and give me a kiss?  I'll let you guess which I want 
              first.
    _Frasier comes over and kisses her._
    **Madeline:** Guess again.
    _Frasier disconsolately turns away, but Madeline grabs him and kisses 
    him again.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    **WHAT NUMBER SUNBLOCK MUST SHE USE?**
    _Scene Five -- Apartment
    Frasier and Madeline are unwinding on the couch with Mai-Tai's and 
    slices of mango on sticks.
    _
    **Madeline:** Mmm, delicious!  I love mangoes.
     **Frasier:** Well, we never got around to sampling this tropical 
              delicacy while we were in the islands, so I thought we 
              should do it now.
    **Madeline:** Good thinking. [_kisses him_]
     **Frasier:** You know, there's something else we never got around to in 
              Bora Bora...
    **Madeline:** Well, you got around to it.  I just watched.
     **Frasier:** Well, how about a little audience participation this time?
    _They embrace, kissing, but this time Madeline stops him._
    **Madeline:** Frasier, wait.  I want this as much as you do, but there's
              something I need to talk to you about first.
     **Frasier:** What?
    **Madeline:** Well, I wasn't going to say anything.  I-I thought I was 
              comfortable with this and I wouldn't have to bring it up, 
              but... well, I was involved with a divorced man once before, 
              and just about the time that I was really falling for him...
              [_Frasier understands_] He reconciled with his ex-wife, and 
              I'm telling you I just can't go through that again.
     **Frasier:** It's all right, Madeline.  Trust me, I assure you that 
              Lilith and I are completely finished.  She lives clear on 
              the other side of the country.  Except in matters of our 
              son, we don't even have contact.
    **Madeline:** That's all I wanted to hear.
    _They embrace again.  Eddie jumps up and stares at them._
    **Madeline:** Well, what's your name, little fella?
     **Frasier:** You promise you won't laugh?
    _Madeline points.  Frasier turns and sees Eddie._
     **Frasier:** The dog?  His name is Eddie. [_gets up and picks up Eddie_] 
              Come on.  Pardon me while I put him back while he belongs.
    **Madeline:** I'll be waiting.
    _For a moment Frasier turns toward the balcony, tempted to hurl Eddie 
    over the side... then he just takes him to the hallway.  
    
    Madeline picks up a stick of mango.  Someone knocks on the door.  
    She gets up and opens the door to -- Lilith!
    _
    **Madeline:** Oh God!
      **Lilith:** It's nice to see you too.  Is Frasier here?
    **Madeline:** Don't you live in Boston?!
      **Lilith:** I'm here on a layover -- and judging by Frasier's trademark 
              mangoes on a stick, so are you.  If you like, I can come 
              back in ten minutes.
    **Madeline:**[_getting her things_] That won't be necessary.
      **Lilith:** I apologize for coming at an inopportune moment, but 
              Frasier and I have an agreement that we'll make time for 
              each other if either one of us has something urgent to 
              discuss -- which I do.
    **Madeline:** Take all the time you need.  This whole thing's just a 
              little too complicated for me.
    _Madeline leaves.  Lilith picks up a mango stick and sits in Martin's 
    Armchair.  Frasier comes out, sees a woman sitting in the chair, and, 
    drawing the obvious conclusion, dims the lights to a seductive level._
     **Frasier:** Put down that mango, my dear.  It's time you tasted the 
              forbidden fruit. [_Lilith turns around_] YAAAHH!!!  Lilith!  
              What are you doing here?!
      **Lilith:** I have something urgent to discuss.
     **Frasier:**[_looking around_] What have you done with Madeline?!
      **Lilith:** She was surprised to see me and she left. 
    _Frasier rushes to the door and looks down the hallway._
      **Lilith:** I hope you're not angry with me.
     **Frasier:** Angry? [_brings the lights back up_]  What do I have to be 
              angry about?  Just because every time I carve out the 
              tiniest little slice of happiness for myself you come along 
              and obliterate it?  My God, woman, I'd drive a stake through 
              your heart, but I don't think anything could kill you!
    _Silence for a moment as Frasier regains control of himself._
      **Lilith:** Brian asked me to marry him.
     **Frasier:** What?
      **Lilith:** He wants to stop in Las Vegas on our way home.
     **Frasier:** You're getting married.
      **Lilith:** Yes.
     **Frasier:** Well... so am I!
      **Lilith:** Really?
     **Frasier:** Yes, yes, to Madeline.
      **Lilith:** Well, I just saw Madeline.  She seemed in an awful hurry for 
              someone who's getting married.
     **Frasier:** She had to buy a dress... oh, God, what am I doing?  I'm not 
              getting married.
      **Lilith:** Wow, you really had me going.  Frasier, I don't want to 
              disrupt anything.  Really, I just came here hoping to get 
              your blessing.
     **Frasier:** I could have given you my blessing over the phone.
      **Lilith:** Must you be so churlish?
     **Frasier:** Well, I think I'm entitled!  I mean, the one comfort in 
              being divorced is that you're both losers.  Eventually, 
              the time comes when one person is the first to move on.  
              And quite frankly, I'd hoped it would be me.
      **Lilith:** Well, I'd hoped it would be me.  And it was!  But, I'd like 
              to think that, had things worked out the other way around, 
              I would have been happy for you.
     **Frasier:** Well, if you love him, I am happy for you.
      **Lilith:** I do.  Brian has been a dutiful suitor for some time, and 
              I'm convinced to within an acceptable margin of error that 
              he loves me. 
     **Frasier:** Does Frederick like him?
      **Lilith:** Oh, he's crazy about him.
    _Somehow, that hurts more than anything that's happened so far._
     **Frasier:** Oh...
      **Lilith:**[_seeing it_] Oh, Frasier, Brian could never take your place 
              that way.  You're Frederick's father.
     **Frasier:**[_grateful_] Congratulations.
    _He hugs her.  Then Martin, Daphne, and Niles come back.  Frasier's 
    body hides Lilith._
      **Daphne:** Well, it looks like they made up!
    _They break apart._
      **Martin:** AAH!
     **Frasier:** Hello, everyone.
       **Niles:** Lilith, what a pleasant surprise!  Well, how was Bora Bora?  
              I've never seen you looking quite so tan.
      **Daphne:** My God, what does she look like in winter?
     **Frasier:** Everyone, we have some very happy news: Lilith is going to 
              be married again.
      **Martin:**[_guardedly_] To who?
     **Frasier:** Someone else.
    _Martin is so overjoyed he drops his cane in his rush across the room 
    to shake Lilith's hand._
      **Martin:** Oh, that's great!  Congratulations!  Wonderful!
    _Niles comes over to shake her hand also (and bring the cane)._
       **Niles:** Just wonderful, when's the happy occasion?
      **Lilith:** Tomorrow, in Las Vegas.
       **Niles:**[_laughs_] Oh, Lilith, how delightfully kitschy!  It's your 
              second marriage, so you've decided to poke fun at the 
              institution by getting married in the tackiest place you 
              could possible choose!
      **Lilith:** Brian's family lives in Las Vegas.
       **Niles:** Well... isn't that convenient?  You'll have someone to show 
              you the museums.
      **Lilith:** It was lovely seeing you all again.
     **Frasier:** I'll just walk you out.
    _They go out into the hallway together.  Lilith calls the elevator._
      **Lilith:** Well, I hope you haven't found all this too unsettling.
     **Frasier:** No, no.  You know, I think it's actually good that you're 
              getting remarried.  I mean, otherwise we could have spent 
              the rest of our lives wondering whether our divorce was a 
              mistake, if we should have tried to work it out.  Was it me, 
              was it you, was it us, was it you?  Now we can move on.
      **Lilith:** What's next for you?
     **Frasier:** I suppose I'll try to smooth things over with Madeline.
      **Lilith:** Try very hard, Frasier.  She seems worth it.
     **Frasier:** Well, she'll need convincing.  You know, I guess I could ask 
              her back to Bora Bora with me, try again. [_excited_] You 
              know, I'll lay on the whole package this time.  I'll buy the 
              airplane tickets first, pay for the hotel, get a limo, 
              champagne and caviar, the whole nine yards.  With any luck 
              I'll sweep her off her feet and into my bed... I do own it, 
              you know.
    _Lilith smiles.  The elevator comes._
      **Lilith:** Would you like to kiss the bride?
     **Frasier:** It'd be my pleasure.
    _They kiss, and she steps onto the elevator._
      **Lilith:** You're really happy for me?
     **Frasier:** Well, yes, of course.  You'll understand, though, if I don't 
              jump up and down and yell "Yippee!"
      **Lilith:**[_as the elevator doors close_] Yes, I've already seen that.
    _And she's gone.  Frasier's not entirely O.K.... but he will be.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Bora Bora
    Exactly as before, Frasier opens the door to his balcony, and looks 
    out at the sea.  Everything is just perfect.  Behind him, Madeline 
    crosses the room wearing only a towel.
    _
    **Madeline:** Now why don't we pick up where we left off, Frasier?
    _Frasier turns around.  The towel drops to the floor._
     **Frasier:** Oh, my God...
       **Diane:** Frasier?
    _This time the woman next door is Diane Chambers!_
     **Frasier:** OH, MY GOD!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    Frasier starts awake in a deck chair.  He's still in Bora Bora, 
    at the same bungalow, but the balcony next door is empty._
     **Frasier:** Oh God, I just had the most frightening dream!  Thank God 
              I'm here with you.
    _Niles opens the balcony door._
       **Niles:** Frasier, we have all week to analyze your dream.  Right now, 
              there's a huge bug in the shower!
    _Frasier sighs, gets up, and ceremoniously removes one shoe.  
    Niles gives him two thumbs up.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    As Niles stands on the balcony, Frasier pursues the bug out of 
    the bathroom and into the bedroom, hammering down with his shoe 
    and missing.  It scurries under the bed, and up the wall behind 
    the canopy.  With familiar motions, Frasier jumps onto the bed 
    and slams the canopy against the wall.
