    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is on the air, doing his show.
    _
    **Frasier:** Well, we've got time for one more call.  Roz, who've we got?
        **Roz:** We have Sid in Bremerton on three.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Sid.  I'm listening.
        **Sid:**[_stiltedly_] Hello, Dr. Crane.  I have a terrible fear of 
             talking on the phone to people I do not know.  I freeze up.  
             It is a severe handicap in today's fast-paced, highly 
             competitive world.
    **Frasier:** Sid, are you reading what you're saying?
        **Sid:** Uh... [_shuffling papers_] Yes, I am.  The only way I can 
             comfortably communicate on the phone is to write everything 
             out I wish to say in advance.
    **Frasier:** Well, what if someone asks you a question you haven't 
             anticipated?
        **Sid:** Uhhhh... [_shuffling papers_] Thank you, Dr. Crane, for your 
             most insightful comment.  G-Goodbye. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Wait, Sid!  Sid, if you're listening, your insecurity is 
             rooted in your fear of making a mistake.  In order to beat 
             this thing, you're going to have to practice.  If you work 
             at it very hard.  Then, one day, you too may achieve the 
             command and confidence to which we all aspire to... be having. 
             [_confused look_] This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good 
             mental health.
    
    _Frasier gets up and walks into Roz's booth._
    
        **Roz:** That was a show good, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Roz.
    
    _Niles enters the booth._
    
      **Niles:** Knock, knock!
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles!  What are you doing here?
      **Niles:** Oh, just stopped by to see how you'd like to go to lunch 
             next week at the Empire Club.
    **Frasier:** You know someone who's a member?
      **Niles:** No, but you may.
    **Frasier:** What are you up to?  You have that same smug look you had 
             on your face when you found that recording of Kirsten 
             Flagstad's 1932 _Gotterdammerung_ in the discount bin.
    
    _Frasier walks into his booth.  Niles follows._
    
      **Niles:** If you think I look smug now, wait till you see me next week.  
             If all goes well, my lapel will be sagging under the weight of 
             a solid gold membership pin.
    
    _Roz enters Frasier's booth._
    
        **Roz:** Well, you'll certainly fit right in with all those greedy, 
             arrogant bluebloods who wouldn't cross the street to spit on 
             the rest of us.
      **Niles:** Don't jinx it, Roz, I'm not in yet.  There's still the 
             cocktail party next week where they screen prospective 
             members, and from what I hear, those can be grueling.
    **Frasier:** So, how did this all come about?
      **Niles:** Oh, really I give the credit to Maris.  She spent five years
             carefully cultivating the right relationships until finally 
             this week, fortune smiled upon us: Old Judge Clement suffered 
             a massive stroke, and, lo! a vacancy opened up.
    **Frasier:** Gives new meaning to the phrase, "a stroke of luck."
    
    _Niles chuckles._
    
      **Niles:** It gets better!  There are actually two vacancies, so my 
             chances are double.  Edgar Van Cortland has been indicted 
             in that savings and loans scandal.  Frasier, I think my time 
             has come.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm very happy for you.
      **Niles:** That's very generous of you, especially knowing you've 
             always dreamed of a membership yourself.  A lesser man 
             would be jealous. [_beat_] You're not, are you?
    **Frasier:** Not at all.
      **Niles:** Did I mention that they have a planetarium on the third floor?
    **Frasier:** So?!
      **Niles:** I think my work here is done.
    _Niles exits.  Frasier picks up his briefcase and walks into Roz's 
    booth._
        **Roz:** So, Niles is getting into the Empire Club?
    **Frasier:** Well, it would appear so.  More power to him.  After all, 
             he deserves to have lunch in that private dining room, 
             and read the _Wall Street Journal_ in that fabled mahogany 
             library...
        **Roz:** It's eating you up inside, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Like a carnivorous bacteria.  If he gets into that club 
             I should too!
        **Roz:**[_picking up phone and dialing_] Well, what if I happen to know 
             someone very high up who could probably get you invited to 
             that cocktail party?
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, don't toy with me!
        **Roz:**[_into phone_] Mr. Strickland, please.  Just tell him it's Roz.
    **Frasier:** Walter Strickland, Jr?!
        **Roz:** Senior.
    **Frasier:**[_gasps_] Roz, how did you ever get to know someone so 
             important?
        **Roz:** The less you know the happier you'll be.
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    Daphne, her hair done up in curlers, is ironing clothes on the dining 
    table.  Martin enters with Eddie.
    _
     **Martin:** Whew!  I think I need more comfortable shoes.  My dogs are 
             killing me.
     **Daphne:** Pardon?
     **Martin:** My dogs.  My feet.  What do you call them in England?
     **Daphne:** Well, we mostly call our body parts by their rightful names. 
             Except my uncle Harold.  He named parts of his anatomy after 
             the royal family.  He walked on the Queen's pins, he sat on 
             the Duchess of Kent.  He was quite a jolly fellow.  That is, 
             until Aunt Kate caught him introducing the Prince of Wales 
             to a cocktail waitress.
    
    _Frasier enters, wearing a tux._
    
    **Frasier:** Daphne, are you almost finished with that?
     **Daphne:** Yes I am, Dr. Crane.  You'll have the handsomest midriff at 
             the Club tonight.
    
    _Daphne gives Frasier the freshly ironed cummerbund._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  I hope my date concurs.  
     **Martin:** Who are you taking to this shindig?
    **Frasier:** Dr. Susan Anderson.  She's as boring as unbuttered toast, 
             but she's a brilliant physician, and been socially well- 
             connected.
     **Martin:** Isn't Niles a little ticked off at you horning in on his big
             party?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes, he was, at first.  But, then I convinced him that 
             we could be of help to each other.  If we work together, 
             we can secure both vacancies.
     **Martin:** Boy, you and Niles -- it's been the same since you were kids.  
             If one of you has something, the other one always has to 
             have it too. [_the doorbell rings_] I had to buy two Balinese 
             lutes, two decoupage kits, two pairs of lederhosen.  When you 
             finally moved out of the house that was one embarrassing 
             garage sale.
    _Frasier answers the door.  It is Niles, who is also wearing a tuxedo._
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Ready to go?
    **Frasier:** No, actually, I'm still waiting on Susan; she's at the 
             hospital.
     **Martin:** Where's Maris?
      **Niles:** Uh, she stayed in the Mercedes, practicing her vivacious 
             giggle.  Let's go over our strategy.  I've prepared a 
             crib sheet on each person on the membership committee.  
             There you are...
    _Frasier and Niles sit on the couch.  Niles takes some practice cards
    out of his pocket and gives them to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Hmm... School ties... business affiliations... hobbies...
             mistresses.
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh!  Now I've also done some research on our 
             competition, and frankly, I don't think we have to 
             worry.  One of them flies coach.  
    
    _They both chuckle condescendingly._
    
    **Frasier:** We're as good as in!  
      **Niles:** Yes, yes...
    **Frasier:** Unless... oh, Niles!  I just had the most terrifying thought.  
      **Niles:** Hmm?
    **Frasier:** What if some other candidate has gone to the trouble of 
             researching... the skeletons in our own closet?
    _Frasier and Niles slowly look to Martin, who is opening a beer.  
    Beer sprays all over his face, after which he attempts to wipe it 
    off with his shirt._
      **Niles:** Well, that's as bad as it gets.
    **Frasier:** I wouldn't be so sure.  I don't think the membership committee 
             would look kindly on your being arrested for mooning President 
             Nixon at the campaign rally.
      **Niles:** I was young and firm and in love with an anarchist.  Besides, 
             that's pretty minor compared to your suicide attempt.
    **Frasier:**[_indignantly_] It was not a legitimate attempt.  I only stepped 
             out on that ledge to get Lilith's attention.
    
    _The phone rings._
    
      **Niles:**[_getting up_] Oh, you know Frasier, perhaps Maris and I should 
             head on over without you.  We can't have the other candidates 
             getting a leg up on us.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's a good idea, Niles.  I'll see you there.
      **Niles:** Alright.  Bye, Dad. 
     **Martin:** Good luck.
      **Niles:** Thanks.
    
    _Niles exits._
    
    **Frasier:**[_answering phone_] Hello?  Oh, Susan, Susan!  Oh my goodness, 
             I've been expecting you.  Are you in the car?  Oh no, you're 
             still at the hospital?  Well, of course I understand.  Well, 
             you were a sweetheart to agree to go in the first place.  
             I'll call you tomorrow. [_hangs up_] Fat chance.
     **Martin:** Stood you up, huh?
    **Frasier:** This is disastrous!
     **Martin:** Well, just go stag.
    **Frasier:** No, I've RSVP'd for two.  I'll look like some loser who 
             couldn't even scrape up a date.
     **Martin:** Wait a minute.  What are we worried about?  We've got our 
             very own Cinderella right under this roof.
    
    _Daphne enters, heading for the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, that's the last time I try to get grout up without 
             wearing rubber gloves.  I've got so much gunk under my nails 
             I look like I've been worming a pig.
     **Martin:**[_to Frasier_] Trust me, the English accent'll sell it. 
    
    _Frasier looks dubious.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **THE CRANE SCRUTINY**
    
    _Scene Three -- The Empire Club
    Frasier and Daphne enter a very luxuriously furnished clubroom.  
    Men in crisp tuxedos mingle, drinking expensive liqueurs.  Frasier 
    is dazzled by the opulence of the club._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh... oh, yes... oh, it's everything I've ever imagined it 
             would be and more!
     **Daphne:** What's that smell, Dr. Crane?
    
    _Frasier sniffs the air._
    
    **Frasier:**[_breathlessly_] That's power.  Oh, Daphne, listen, call me
             Frasier.  I don't want people to know that you work for me, 
             all right?  If they ask, we've been dating for six months.
     **Daphne:** Alright, Frasier. [_she laughs_]  Anything else, Frasier?  
             Now, are we in love, or is this just a physical thing, 
             Frasier?  [_she grins_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, now just stop that!
    _Frasier and Daphne walk in arm in arm.  Suddenly they spot Niles, 
    who rushes over to greet them._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, Niles!  How goes the chase?
      **Niles:** Brilliantly! [_he sees Daphne; breathlessly_] Daphne!
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** What are you doing here?
     **Daphne:** Oh, Frasier takes me everywhere, don't you, sweetheart?  
             I think I'll go sample some of the hors d'oeuvres.  
             Back in a minute, darling.
    
    _She moves off._
    
      **Niles:**[_apoplectic_] "Sweetheart?"  "Darling?"
    **Frasier:** Listen, my date canceled, Daphne's filling in, all right?  
             You can't honestly think that I would end up going out with 
             Daphne?
      **Niles:** Well, you are a man.  She is a goddess... whose bedroom is, 
             after all, only forty-one steps from your own.
    **Frasier:** On a completely unrelated topic, where's Maris?
      **Niles:** The last I saw, she was apologizing to one of the other
             candidate's wives.  Apparently, Maris bumped an entire 
             chafing dish of crabmeat into the poor woman's decolletage.
    **Frasier:** Accidents will happen.
      **Niles:** Yes.  As long as they keep the hors d'oeuvres flowing, they 
             will.
    
    _Frasier feels the back of one of the leather armchairs._
    
    **Frasier:**[_gasps_] My god!  Niles, feel this leather!  Oh, I have had 
             pudding stiffer than this!
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier! [_points to a man filling a pipe nearby_] Kenneth
             Spencer!
    _Frasier and Niles take out a small blue index card, scan its contents,
    and stroll over to Kenneth Spencer._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, Niles, I'm sure it was very satisfying being Phi Beta 
             Kappa at Yale, but surely you would have been happier to 
             wear the orange and black of Princeton.  
    
    _Kenneth Spencer overhears and looks up suddenly._
    
      **Niles:** Of course, anyone who's anyone went to Princeton.
    **Spencer:** Excuse me, I'm Kenneth Spencer.  I couldn't help but
             overhear you.  As it happens, I went to Princeton.
    **Frasier/Niles:**[_seemingly surprised_] Oh, no!
      **Niles:** What are the odds?
    **Frasier:** Allow me. [_shaking hands_] I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, and this is 
             my brother, Dr. Niles Crane, the eminent psychiatrist.
      **Niles:** My brother is too kind.  He was already eminent when my 
             eminence was merely imminent.
    
    _Daphne approaches._
    
     **Daphne:** Here, try this caviar, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Thanks.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry it took so long, but I met the most charming 
             gentleman, Edgar Van Cortland.
    **Frasier:** Van Cortland?  I thought he lost his membership in the 
             S & L scandal.
    **Spencer:** Actually, he was acquitted of all charges and reinstated
             in the club.
    **Frasier:** Oh, he was innocent?
    **Spencer:** No, just acquitted.
    _He chuckles, and the Crane men join in, but the shift in Frasier and 
    Niles's attitudes is immediate and drastic._
      **Niles:** So does that mean that there's only one membership?
    **Spencer:** Yes - oh, but not to worry.  If one of you should be selected,  
             you can always bring the other along as a guest.
      **Niles:** Well, if only one of us can be honored with a membership, 
             I hope it will be you, Frasier.
    **Spencer:** That's a very noble sentiment.
      **Niles:** Well, I know how much it means to him.  We can't risk another 
             splashy suicide attempt.
    _Frasier chuckles lightly, and puts a brotherly arm around Niles's 
    shoulders._
    **Frasier:** That's very amusing, Niles, using humor to defuse a tense 
             situation.  I'm sure that stood you in good stead when you 
             were in prison for threatening the president.
    _Niles is about to object, when Frasier squeezes his collarbone enough 
    to make him gasp.  Mr. Drake, the club president, calls from across the 
    room._
      **Drake:** Kenneth?  Kenneth!
    **Spencer:** Excuse me.
    _Kenneth Spencer moves off.  Niles and Frasier begin bickering furiously, 
    with Niles yelping in pain as Frasier tightens his grip on him.  Daphne 
    finally stops them._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, stop it!  Do you intend to stand there running each other 
             down and ruin both your chances?
    **Frasier:** No, no.
      **Niles:** Of course you're right.
     **Daphne:** Thank you.
    
    _Wentworth, a butler, approaches them._
    
    **Wentworth:** Cocktails, gentlemen?
      **Frasier:** Oh, yes, I'd like two ounces of your best 18-year-old 
               Lowland single malt scotch.
        **Drake:**[_sitting in one of the armchairs_] There's a discriminating 
               choice.
        **Niles:** Yes, my brother has an extensive knowledge of fine wines and
               spirits - undoubtedly acquired during the years when he was 
               shacked up with a barmaid.
    
    _Niles gives a light chuckle, and hurries off.  Frasier smiles at 
    Drake, and chases after Niles.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa
    Frasier and Roz are sitting at a table in the corner._
    
        **Roz:** So my mom says, "how come you never bring your boyfriends 
             out to meet me?"  And I say, "Mom, the plane trip to 
             Wisconsin takes four hours, and that's longer than most of 
             my relationships last."
    _Niles enters and takes a table, and apparently does not notice Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Oh, there's Niles.  No, don't look at him!  Pretend we don't 
             even see him.
        **Roz:** Real mature, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Thanks to that backstabber, I will never get to say the phrase 
             I've been rehearsing for a lifetime: "If you need me, I'll be 
             at my club."
        **Roz:** Frasier, this is so boring!  Don't you both owe each other 
             an apology?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes!  But I was the first to apologize last time.  
             Oh, wait - that means it's his turn!  Oh, goody, I _can_
             be mature about this!
    
    _Frasier gets up and slowly walks over to Niles's table._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** After last night's behavior, I believe an apology is in order.
      **Niles:** I agree... Well?
    **Frasier:** "Well," what?
      **Niles:** It's your turn.  I apologized first last time.
    **Frasier:** No, you didn't!
      **Niles:** I did so!  I distinctly remember.  It was after that 
             shouting match at the Monet exhibit.  I had my secretary 
             leave a heartfelt apology with your service.
    **Frasier:** So you did.  That means it is my turn again... Damn! 
             [_he pauses_] I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** Me too!
    
    _They both begin to apologize to each other profusely._
    
    **Frasier:** I can't believe we just turned on each other like that.
      **Niles:** It was embarrassing.  My only excuse is that all my life, 
             I have dreamed of belonging to an exclusive club like the 
             Empire.  Even as a child, when I formed clubs with my teddy 
             bears, there were always two or three who didn't make the cut.
    
    _Niles's cell phone rings._
    
      **Niles:** Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Crane. [_to Frasier_] It's the club. 
             [_into phone_] Yes?  I see.  Well, thank you for considering 
             me.  If you'd care to speak to my brother he's right here. 
             [_he hands the phone to Frasier:_] Be gracious.
    **Frasier:**[_dejectedly_] Hello?  Yes, I see.  Thank you very much for
             calling.  Goodbye. [_he hangs up and stares at the table_]
      **Niles:** Don't let it get you down.  We got along fine without them 
             before and we'll get along fine now. [_Frasier is silent_] 
             We are getting along without them, aren't we?
    **Frasier:** Niles...
      **Niles:** Oh my god... you got in. 
    _Frasier nods._
      **Niles:**...Congratulations.  I'd better go break the news to Maris. 
             [_he gets up_]
    **Frasier:** Believe me, Niles, your getting passed up like this has 
             drained every drop of joy from this.
      **Niles:** Thank you.  You're a good brother. 
    _Niles exits the caf e.  Roz comes over and hugs Frasier.
    _
    **Frasier:** YES!!!  I got in, I got in!  I got... shout it from the 
             rooftops!  Lattes for everyone!  This is the proudest day 
             of my life!
    _Niles has reentered the caf e to get his coat and sees Frasier 
    rejoicing.  He gives him an icy glare._
    
    **Frasier:**[_puts a hand on Niles's shoulder_] Of course, what really 
             matters is family.
    
    _Niles disgustedly takes Frasier's hand off and exits.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Frasier's Apartment
    In the kitchen, Martin is dangling a piece of meat above Eddie._
    
     **Martin:** Beg!  Come on, boy, we've been working on this, you can do it.  
             Beg?
    
    _Eddie stays sitting and does nothing._
    
     **Martin:** Sit!  Good boy! [_he gives him the meat_]
    
    _Frasier enters the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, what are you doing?
     **Martin:** I'm teaching Eddie a new trick.
    **Frasier:** With my twenty-six-dollar-a-pound imported prosciutto?
     **Martin:** Aw, wait'll you see it.  It's worth it!
    **Frasier:** Not unless he can sing the love duet from _Tosca._
    
    _Frasier leaves the kitchen.  Martin follows._
    
     **Martin:** Where you going?
    **Frasier:**[_getting his coat_] Down to the Empire Club.  I've come to a 
             moral decision.  I'm going to insist that they give Niles my 
             membership.
     **Martin:**[_sitting down in his chair_] Wow!  That's a hell of a gesture.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, I put myself in Niles' place.  After all, he's spent 
             the last fifteen years diligently trying to climb Seattle's 
             social ladder, then I waltz in and within two years I'm known 
             throughout the city.  To top it all off, I end up grabbing 
             the prize he's wanted most of all.  It just isn't fair.
     **Martin:** You're a good kid, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad. [_Daphne enters, carrying a laundry basket_]
             I might as well say this while I still can: "If anyone needs 
             me... I'll be at my club."
    _He starts to exit._
     **Daphne:** Oh, yes, the club.  The club that I helped you get into.  
             Of course, now that you're done with me, I'm just cast 
             aside... [_hangs her head_] unappreciated, unloved, and 
             forgotten.
    **Frasier:** Yes well, I see the prosciutto isn't the only imported ham 
             in the house.
    
    _Frasier exits._
    
     **Daphne:** Give me your shirt.  I'm not going down without a full load. 
             [_Martin takes off his shirt_] Have you got anything white?
     **Martin:** Yeah, but you're not getting 'em.
    
    _The doorbell rings and Daphne answers it to Niles._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.  Hello, Dad.
     **Martin:** Niles.
    _Niles turns to speak to Daphne, but she has already disappeared out 
    the door, lowering his spirits further._
      **Niles:** Just passed Frasier in the hall.  Where was he off to?
     **Martin:** He went to the Club.
    
    _Niles dejectedly feigns laughter._
    
      **Niles:** No wonder he was evasive.  I hope you don't mind my stopping 
             by.  I just had to get out of the house, and Lord knows I had 
             no place else to go. [_he collapses on the couch_]
     **Martin:** You know, Niles, you may get into that club yet.
    
    _Niles begins to chuckle but stops and lifts his head._
    
      **Niles:** What are you talking about?
     **Martin:** That's why Frasier went down there: to tell them to give 
             his spot to you.
      **Niles:**[_sits up_] Dad, is this one of your sick jokes?
     **Martin:** Well, I thought you'd be happy!  He's giving up his own 
             membership.
    
    _Niles gets up angrily._
    
      **Niles:** What exactly did you think I would be happy about?!  This is
             humiliating -- my big brother going down there to make them 
             take me?
     **Martin:** Well, his heart's in the right place.  You could show a 
             little gratitude.
      **Niles:** Dad, they made their decision.  If they didn't take me on my 
             own merits I certainly don't want them to take me out of pity.  
             I don't care if they invite me now, I don't even care if they 
             beg!
    _Eddie suddenly gets up on his hind legs and starts to beg._
     **Martin:** Good boy!
    
    _Niles exits.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **HE AIN'T HEAVY...HE'S MY BROTHER**
    _Scene Six -- The Empire Club
    Frasier is once again at the Empire Club.  He sees Wentworth._
    
      **Frasier:** Excuse me, is the club president here?
    **Wentworth:** Yes, Dr. Crane.  Mr. Drake is over there. 
    _He points to a slightly elderly gentleman sitting in one of the central 
    leather armchairs._
    
      **Frasier:** Thank you.
    	
    _Frasier walks over to Mr. Drake._
    
      **Frasier:** Excuse me, Mr. Drake?
        **Drake:** Yes?
      **Frasier:** Dr. Frasier Crane.
        **Drake:**[_shakes hand with Frasier_] Oh yes, of course!  The new 
               blood.  Please, sit down.
      **Frasier:** Thank you. [_does so_] Sir, I've come here on a matter of 
               personal business.  It's about my brother, Niles.  You see,  
               Niles is a sort of... [_sinking into chair_] Oh... ohhhh!  
               Oh my God!  This leather's as soft as a baby's bottom!
        **Drake:** Yes, on family night we bring the babies in and do a 
               blindfold comparison test.
    
    _Frasier looks incredulous._
    
        **Drake:**[_stern_] That's a joke, Crane.
      **Frasier:**[_suddenly laughing_] Oh, yes!  Yes, indeed, yes.  Darned good 
               one too, sir.  Yes, as I was saying, although my brother may 
               seem a bit priggish at times, believe me, he's one of the 
               most discriminating people I've ever known.  In fact, I 
               think you'd be hard pressed to find a bigger snob in this 
               room, I mean...
    _Wentworth approaches, carrying a tray containing two glasses and a bottle of port._
    
    **Wentworth:** Excuse me, sir, I thought you might enjoy a glass of port.
      **Frasier:**[_Reading label_] 1896?!
        **Drake:** What are you trying to say, Crane?
      **Frasier:**[_raises his glass_] Glad to be aboard, sir! [_then:_] No, no, 
               no... No, I came down here to simply say that my brother 
               deserves membership more than I do, and I would like to 
               step down in his favor.
        **Drake:** Are you serious?
      **Frasier:** Yes, yes I am... after all, blood is thicker than port. 
               [_sips the port_] I stand corrected!
        **Drake:** Let me be candid with you, Crane.  We all liked your brother, 
               but some were quite firm about accepting anybody in the 
               entertainment business.  I'm afraid "radio psychiatrist" 
               falls into that category.
      **Frasier:** Radio psychiatrist?  But Niles... 
    
    _Niles enters just in time to hear:_ 
    
      **Frasier:** Mr. Drake, there's been a terrible mistake.
        **Niles:** No, Frasier, there hasn't.
    
    _Frasier gets up hurriedly._
    
      **Frasier:** Niles!
        **Niles:** Dad told me you would be here, trying to get me into your 
               snooty little club.  Well, you needn't bother.
      **Frasier:** Niles, you don't understand!
        **Niles:** No, you don't understand!  You don't need to be the big 
               brother anymore.  I don't need you to fight my battles!
      **Frasier:** But, Niles-!
        **Niles:** No, butt out!
      **Frasier:** Okay...
        **Niles:**[_to Mr. Drake_] And as for you, you've made it quite clear 
               how you feel about me, so I'd like to share how I feel 
               about you.  I'd sooner spend my leisure time in a smelly 
               bus station than spend one moment with you smug, elitist 
               bigwigs, with your cliched oriental carpets and your 
               overstuffed chairs. [_feels chair_] My God, it's like a 
               baby's bottom! [_then:_] You can't reject me, because I 
               reject you!  Yes, I'm talking to you, Fuzzy!  I prefer to 
               remain Niles Crane, Everyman. [_he throws his arm over 
               Wentworth's shoulders_] Friend of the average Joe.
      **Frasier:** Niles, they got our names mixed up.  I didn't get in, you 
               did.
        **Niles:** What?
      **Frasier:** It was you they wanted all along.
        **Niles:** Really?  I'm in? [_to Wentworth_] Good God, don't just stand 
               there, man, fetch me some port and step lively!
        **Drake:**[_to Wentworth_] Will you escort these gentlemen out?
        **Niles:** Oh, no, no, no, no... [_sits in chair, and begins to rub his 
               cheek on the wing_] You can't think that I meant those things 
               that I was saying before.
    **Wentworth:** Excuse me, sir, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.
        **Niles:**[_stands up defiantly_] You and who else?
    _Someone taps Niles on the shoulder.  Niles turns around and sees a very 
    large butler standing there._
    
        **Niles:** Ah...
      **Frasier:** Niles, come along.  We don't need this club.  Let us leave 
               with the dignity with which we came. [_exits_]
    _Sadly, this is too much to ask from Niles:_
        **Niles:** But-but no... there's, there's been a misunderstanding,  
               I do want to be one of you.  Perhaps you could put me 
               on probation...
    _The butler tries to drag him away, then just picks him up and carries 
    him out, as Niles continues to plead._
        **Niles:** I could just come part time, or perhaps afternoons, or just 
               one afternoon - Thursday's a slow day - or you can pick the 
               day, I wouldn't even have to talk to anyone, I could just 
               sit in a chair and not say a word...
    _The last we see of Niles is his hand, as it frantically grabs the 
    doorjamb to delay his bouncing._
        **Niles:** Please, please, please!  Oh, let me stay, I belong here!
    _As his hand disappears, we FADE OUT.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier is relaxed on the couch, reading a paper.  Eddie is on his 
    hind legs, begging.  Frasier gives him a piece of meat, yet Eddie 
    does not stop.  Frasier angrily throws the entire tray of meat on 
    the floor and continues to read._
