    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier is seated at a table.  Niles walks in and is about to shut the 
    door when he spots a woman behind him.  He graciously holds the door 
    open for her.
    _
      **Niles:** Allow me. 
    _She breezes by without a word._
      **Niles:** You're welcome. [_hangs up coat and walks over to Frasier_] 
             When did everyone become so boorish? [_wipes down chair_] 
             Honestly, sometimes I think I'm the only person left in 
             the world with any sense  of refinement. [_sits_] Ooh! Ooh! 
             Smell my hands!
    **Frasier:** Thank you, no.
      **Niles:** I'm just so proud. I had to stop for gas, and I pumped it 
             myself! [_smells his hands and grimaces_] It's part of a new 
             kick I'm on.
    **Frasier:** Which is what?
      **Niles:** I'm learning to be handy.  I've decided I depend too much on 
             other people, so I'm doing it myself. [_holds out his hand_] 
             Ooh, feel that.  Tell me that's not the start of a first-rate 
             callus.
    _Roz walks in carrying a videotape._
        **Roz:** Frasier, you left this in your booth.
    **Frasier:** Oh dear, thank you Roz.
      **Niles:** What is it?
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's a tape Dad asked me to rent for him.  It's part of 
             our new Wednesday night ritual.  Dad mixes up a pot of his 
             five-alarm chili, we all curl up on the couch and watch an 
             Angie Dickinson movie and I wish I were dead.  You should 
             join us.
      **Niles:** No, no.  I got my first work shirt this morning and tonight 
             I'm tackling the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, be sure to wear your hernia belt.  So, Roz, you 
             gonna join us?
        **Roz:**[_pointedly at Niles_] No, I think I'll just go sit over here. 
      **Niles:** Roz?  Are you trying to avoid me?
        **Roz:** Well, can you blame me?  I mean, it took you nearly a year 
             just to learn my name and every time we sit together, you 
             have some kind of snide remark to make.
      **Niles:** Name one.
        **Roz:** Well, last week you told me my bedroom was easier to get 
             into than a community college.
      **Niles:** I was hoping that would be the one you'd name. 
        **Roz:**[_charging at him_] You know, I've got half a mind to...
    **Frasier:** No, no, no!  Just hold on now, Roz.  You and Niles got off on 
             the wrong foot a long time ago.  I think if you two sat down 
             and had a real conversation you'd hit it off famously.  Here, 
             you sit, Roz, and I will go and get your coffee. 
    _Roz sits down as Frasier goes to the counter._
      **Niles:**[_pause_] So, how are you?
        **Roz:** Fine.  You?
      **Niles:** Great. [_pause_] I'm handy now. [_Roz stares at him_] 
             So...that's a nice jacket.
        **Roz:** Thank you.
      **Niles:** Offbeat.
        **Roz:** And what is that supposed to mean, "offbeat"?
      **Niles:** Well...
        **Roz:** No, wait, I think I know exactly what it means.  Offbeat as 
             in cheap.  Well, excuse me for not being rich enough to shop 
             at the International House of Tight-Ass like you and Maris 
             the heiress!  That is what you meant, right?
      **Niles:** Yes... but I had no idea you'd pick up on it!
        **Roz:** Then you were insulting me.
      **Niles:** Yes, but you got in a couple of good shots yourself.
        **Roz:** I did, didn't I?  I'm so glad we did this! 
    _They shake hands as Frasier returns._
    **Frasier:** You know, sometimes I am such a good therapist, I scare 
             myself! [_notices_] Oh my goodness... where's my briefcase? 
      **Niles:** Didn't you put it under your chair?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes I did, but someone must have taken it!
      **Niles:** Frasier, look, there it is!
    _Niles points to a man walking towards the door, carrying a briefcase.  
    Frasier rushes to the door to block the man from leaving._
    **Frasier:** Excuse me.
        **Man:** Excuse me. 
    **Frasier:** Is that your briefcase? 
        **Man:** Yes, it is. 
    **Frasier:** Where did you get it?
        **Man:** Some of the nuns in my parish bought it for me as a gift.
    **Frasier:** Ah, your parish?  Then that would make you a priest?
        **Man:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** Well, then, "Father" [_grabs the briefcase_], perhaps you'd 
             like to explain why you'd be carrying around... [_opens the 
             case_]...a Bible and some rosary beads?! [_slams the case 
             shut_]
        **Man:** What exactly are you looking for?
    **Frasier:** An Angie Dickinson movie.  I loaned it to the Monsignor.  He 
             was supposed to give it to you to give to me.  Apparently he 
             forgot.  Well, it's a two-day rental anyway, doesn't matter. 
             Off you go.  Thank you. 
    _The priest leaves, confused._
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, Frasier.  It looked exactly like yours.  They both 
             have the same inferior leather.
        **Roz:** I gave him that briefcase!
      **Niles:**[_playfully punching her shoulder_] I know! 
    _FADE OUT_
    **IT'S LIKE HORATIO**
    _Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier is seated at the dinner table, on the phone to the police. 
    Eddie is in Martin's chair, staring at Frasier._
    **Frasier:** Yes, I would mind holding again!  Look, I've already held 
             three times!  I'm simply trying to report a few stolen 
             credit cards, but every five seconds...damn it! [_He 
             notices Eddie staring_] Don't stare at me, Eddie.  I'm 
             a humane man, but right now I could kick a kitten 
             through an electric fan!
    _Eddie jumps down and runs off down the hall as Martin and Daphne 
    enter.  They ad-lib hellos._
     **Martin:** So, Niles called.  Somebody stole your briefcase, huh? 
    **Frasier:** Yes, all right, Dad, go ahead; tell me how stupid I was to 
             get taken advantage of that way.  It's certainly better than 
             listening to "Jumping Jack Flash" arranged for piano and 
             flute. 
     **Martin:** I don't think it was stupid.  These guys are pros.  They just 
             need a second and bam, they're out the door. 
    **Frasier:** Well, that's rather refreshing.  I was expecting you to call 
             me every name from a naive dupe to a...
     **Martin:** Bone-headed rube?
    **Frasier:** But you're not! 
     **Martin:** No, I'm not.  The important thing is you learned a lesson. 
             You got to keep your guard up.  The world would be a happier 
             place if everybody would remember two little words: People 
             stink.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, but that's just a little cynical for me!  I don't 
             want to go through life thinking the worst of people.  I 
             prefer to think of them as basically good and decent. [_into 
             phone_] Yes, I am here, but you know, I'm sorry, I'm in the 
             middle of a speech right now, so you'll have to hold! 
             [_places phone on hold_] Truth is, I enjoy my life that way. 
             If the price I have to pay is to replace a few credit cards 
             from time to time, well then, so be it. 
     **Daphne:** This whole thing reminds me of when I first moved to London. 
             I was very mistrusting of people back then.  I was convinced 
             the way to stay out of harm's way was to walk straight with 
             me eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance.  But, 
             finally, I decided that was no way to live.  So one day, I 
             just lifted up my chin and took it all in.  Well, the change 
             was amazing.  There were sights I'd never seen, sounds I'd 
             never heard.  A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his 
             hand.  He needed help.  I realized this was no city full of 
             thieves and muggers.  There were people here who needed me.  
             I took his note, read it, and to this day, I can remember just 
             what I said to that Man: "That's not how you spell 
             ï¿½fellatio.'"
    _She exits to her room, leaving Frasier and Martin dumbstruck._
    **Frasier:** So... whose point did she prove?
     **Martin:** I have no idea.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - KACL.
    The next day.  Frasier is finishing up his show._
    **Frasier:** Well, I can't tell you how much fun it's been chatting with 
             you all today, nasty old Gertrude aside.  But, I'd like to 
             close the show with a personal message.  This goes out to the 
             person who stole my briefcase yesterday.  And, as it turns 
             out, also stole my dry cleaning this morning with the claim 
             ticket that was inside.  You need help, and I am here to 
             provide it.  Oh, also, the double-breasted navy blue suit 
             was meant to be worn with French cuffs and medium heel wing 
             tips.  You may be sick, but there's no reason why you 
             shouldn't be stylish.  Until tomorrow, this is Dr. Frasier 
             Crane.
    _He goes off the air as Roz enters his booth._
        **Roz:** Man, that was a great show!  It was better than great - it was 
             brilliant.  I can't remember when you were more...
    **Frasier:** What do you want?
        **Roz:** Okay.  Remember, I told you my girlfriend was coming to town 
             and I might need Friday off?
    **Frasier:** No.
        **Roz:** No, you don't remember, or no, I can't have Friday off?
    **Frasier:** Take one of each, I'm feeling generous. 
    _The phone rings in the studio, Frasier puts it on speakerphone._
    **Frasier:** Hello?
        **Man:**[_v.o._] Hi, is this Dr. Crane?
    **Frasier:** Yes, it is.
        **Man:** Oh man, what a thrill!  I can't believe I got through! 
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, actually, my show is over.  You'll have to call in 
             again tomorrow. 
        **Man:** That's not why I'm calling.  I think I found your briefcase.
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  Really, are you sure?
        **Man:** Pretty sure. 
    **Frasier:** Well, there's a way we can be positive.  Simply turn over the 
             briefcase and in the upper right-hand corner you should find 
             a half-moon-shaped watermark, such as would be left by the 
             careless resting of a champagne flute. 
        **Man:** It's full of your stuff, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Well, that works as well, yes.  Say, listen, is 
             everything still there?
        **Man:** Well, there's a nice gold pen, a set of car keys, a date 
             book...
    **Frasier:** What about my wallet?
        **Man:** Oh, sorry.
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose that was asking for too much.  Well, how can 
             I get it back?
        **Man:** I could drop it off.
    **Frasier:** Oh, better yet, why don't you meet me at the Cafe Nervosa on 
             Pike and Third.  I'd be glad to give you a reward.
        **Man:** Hey, meeting you is reward enough!  Half an hour okay?
    **Frasier:** That's perfect.  Bye.
        **Man:** Bye.
    _He hangs up the phone._
        **Roz:** Well, that was pretty great.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but not surprising.  Haven't I always told you to have 
             faith in people?
        **Roz:** Yes, and you were right.  People are basically good.
    **Frasier:** Yes.
        **Roz:** And fair.
    **Frasier:** Indeed.
        **Roz:** We do nice things for people in this world because there's a 
             little thing called karma...
    **Frasier:** There's no way you're getting Friday off.
    _He walks out into the hallway, with Roz whining "Why?" behind him.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Cafe Nervosa.
    Frasier is waiting at the counter.  Niles enters and holds the door 
    open for a pretty blonde woman.
    _
      **Niles:** Allow me. 
    _As before, the woman breezes past him without a word.  
    He walks over to Frasier in a huff._
      **Niles:** Do you believe that woman?  That's the second time that's 
             happened to me this week.  I have half a mind to say 
             something. 
    **Frasier:** Well, then why don't you?
      **Niles:** Oh, you know.  Something happens to me when I talk to a 
             beautiful woman.  From the moment they begin staring into 
             my eyes my knees turn to jelly. 
    **Frasier:** Still, Niles, we both know the only way to break people off 
             their bad habits is by confronting them.
    _The blonde walks up to the counter and stands next to Niles._
      **Niles:** Oh, that's true.
    **Frasier:** So? [_gestures toward the woman_]
     **Waiter:** Who's next here?
      **Woman:****[_cutting off Niles_] I am! I'll have a cafe...
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, oh, oh!  No, you're not!  You weren't next here, I am! 
             [_turns to face her_] I suppose people like you who glide 
             through life wrapped in a cozy little cocoon of narcissism 
             never notice such things.  But you'd do well to learn this 
             lesson, sister! [_beginning to wobble_] There's still such a 
             thing as good manners in this world, and that's why I would 
             like to insist that you let me buy you your coffee and also 
             please try the poppy seed muffins. 
      **Woman:**** Thank you.
      **Niles:** You're welcome. 
    _He places some money on the counter and then staggers to a table, 
    unsure of what just happened._
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic_] Kind of brutal, weren't you?
      **Niles:** All I remember was, I was next and then the sound of blood 
             thundering through my ears.
    **Frasier:** There, there, Niles.  Soon you'll be home with Maris and 
             you'll forget you were anywhere near a beautiful woman 
             today. [_moves toward the window seat_] Please, why don't we 
             sit here by the window so we can see him when he comes?
      **Niles:** Oh, your good Samaritan?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  You know, I have to tell you Niles, I'm feeling rather 
             good about this whole thing.  Granted, I did lose my wallet 
             and my favorite suit.  But, still, mostly everything else was 
             intact.  My date book, my spare set of car keys, my fountain 
             pen.  But, best of all, what has remained intact is my sense 
             that people are basically trustworthy.
      **Niles:** Frasier, the person who has your car keys asked you to meet 
             him here, knowing you'd bring your car?
    **Frasier:** Now, now... before you launch into one of your little 
             paranoid riffs, my car happens to be...[_looks out the 
             window_] MOVING DOWN THE STREET!! 
    _They both rush outside._
    **Frasier:** Oh my god! [_o.s._] Stop!  Stop that well-dressed man!
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene One - Frasier's apartment.
    Later that evening. Niles sits on the couch, drinking coffee while 
    Martin is on the phone with an old cop buddy of his._
     **Martin:** Yeah, Charlie, it's my son Frasier's car.  So, if you could 
             put a little extra manpower on this, I'd appreciate it. 
             Yeah, I know.  I know, fell for that old scam. [_Niles exits 
             to the kitchen_] I told him you gotta keep your guard up, but 
             you know Frasier, he always knows better - Mr. Up With 
             People.  Yeah, remember what we used to call guys like him 
             when I was on the force? [_laughs, then_] Hey, we're still 
             talking about my son here, Charlie!  Yeah, I'll talk to you. 
    _He hangs up the phone as Frasier enters._
     **Martin:** Hi Frasier, how's it going?
    **Frasier:** Terribly.  Guess what happened today?
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** My car was stolen!
     **Martin:**[_pretending_] You're kidding!
    **Frasier:** Yes, once again, I fell victim to a master criminal. 
     **Martin:** How'd they do it?  Hot-wire it?  Boy, you know, those guys got 
             fingers like concert pianists. 
    **Frasier:** No.  He had the key.
     **Martin:** Oh, a real pro, huh?  He made a wax impression and then had a 
             duplicate key made?
    **Frasier:** No... It was the same miscreant who stole my briefcase.  He 
             used the spare set that was inside. 
     **Martin:** What?  He tailed you for a few days, learned your routine, so 
             he'd know where to find the car? 
    **Frasier:**[_sheepishly_] Not exactly.  He called the station and we 
             agreed to meet.
     **Martin:** What for?
      **Niles:**[_entering from the kitchen_] Low-fat lattes and biscotti.
    _He and Martin fall apart laughing._
    **Frasier:** Oh, what are you, the town crier?!  Oh, go ahead and laugh! 
             You know, it still doesn't shake my belief in the basic 
             goodness of people. 
     **Martin:** Well, sure.  He's probably using your car to deliver hot 
             meals to shut-ins. [_he and Niles laugh again_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I'm glad that my misfortune has given you two so 
             much glee!  But Dad, I have two requests.  First, wipe that 
             father-knows-best smirk off of your face!  I am not a child!
     **Martin:** And, what's the second request?
    **Frasier:** Can I borrow your car?  I want to go to the movies.
    _Niles and Martin continue laughing as the scene fades out.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **BRIEFCASE OF LOVE**
    _Scene Two - KACL.
    Frasier is giving Daphne a tour of KACL before his show begins._
    **Frasier:** And last stop on our tour, my booth.  Where all the magic 
             happens.
        **Roz:** Hey Daphne, what are you doing here?
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane needed a lift in, so I decided to come up for 
             a little tour.  Oh, don't mind me.  Just go on about your 
             business.  
    _She stoops over his console, holds his headphones to her ear, 
    and talks into the microphone._
     **Daphne:** It's not like... I'm listening. [_giggles_]
        **Roz:** Have we had one visitor yet who _didn't_ feel the need to do 
             that?
    **Frasier:** Thank you for the ride down, Daphne, but we do have a show 
             to do.  So if you...
     **Daphne:** You know, people are always telling me I have a natural 
             talent for this. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, of course.  Your soothing voice, your calming 
             manner. [_walks her to the door_] I could listen to you for 
             hours.
     **Daphne:** Oh, wow, do you really think so?
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  All right, now get out. [_shoves her out 
             the door._]
    _The phone in the studio rings._
    **Frasier:** Roz, could you get that, please?
        **Roz:** Sure. [_in phone_] Hello?  Who's calling please?  Just a second. 
             [_to Frasier_] It's Denise.  She said she was out with you last 
             night.
    **Frasier:** I wasn't out with anyone named Denise last night.
        **Roz:** Ooh... speaker phone, speaker phone!
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right. [_places it on speaker phone_] Hello.  This is 
             Frasier Crane.
     **Denise:**[_v.o._] Hey, tiger.  I miss you already. 
    **Frasier:** I beg your pardon?
     **Denise:** Oh, I'm sorry to call you at work, but you just snuck out of 
             here this morning without giving me your number and I woke 
             up to see your BMW pulling down my driveway. 
    **Frasier:**[_realizing_] You did?
     **Denise:** Mm-hmm.  But I'm not mad.  How can I be after the best first 
             night I ever spent with a man?
    **Frasier:** Denise, could you just hold on for a moment?
     **Denise:** Sure.
    _He places the phone on hold._
    **Frasier:** Do you realize what this means?
        **Roz:** The guy who stole your stuff told her he was you.
    **Frasier:** And it worked!  She slept with him on the first date!  Nobody 
             ever sleeps with me on the first date! [_takes phone off 
             hold_] Hi, it's me again. 
     **Denise:** Look, I'm sorry to do this on short notice, but I won't be 
             able to meet you for that drink at Alberto's.  The agency 
             called.  They booked me for a swimsuit layout. 
    _Frasier is nearly in tears.  Over the phone a horn honks._
     **Denise:** Oh, there's my cab.  I'll call you tomorrow.  Kisses! 
             [_hangs up_]
    
    [_N.B. The celebrity who plays Denise is uncredited._]
    
        **Roz:** Unbelievable!
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Apparently he wasn't content just to steal my 
             possessions.  Now he's after my identity as well!
        **Roz:**[_picking up phone_] I'm calling the police.
    **Frasier:** No, Roz, no!  I will handle this myself.  I am going down to 
             Alberto's.
        **Roz:** You have a show!
    **Frasier:** Just run something from the "Best of Frasier Crane."  This 
             jackal thinks he's meeting Denise down there, but he's going 
             to meet me instead!
        **Roz:** Are you crazy?!  He could be dangerous!
    **Frasier:** I don't care, Roz!  My god, this man's gone too far.  He's 
             after my very soul now!  What was it Shakespeare wrote?  "He 
             who steals my purse steals trash.  But he who steals my good 
             name steals..."  Well... oh, I forget the rest, but it makes 
             me good and mad!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Alberto's.
    Frasier enters Alberto's just as two men are leaving.  He quickly 
    looks them over to see what they are wearing.  He then approaches a 
    woman, Heather, seated at the bar._
    **Frasier:** Excuse me.  Have you seen a man in here wearing an impeccably 
             tailored Italian suit?
    **Heather:** Just you.
    **Frasier:**[_blushes_] Oh, well... thank you.  Giorgio Armani.
    **Heather:** Nice to meet you, Giorgio. [_they laugh_] My name's Heather.
    **Frasier:** Yes, uh, Frasier Crane, it's a pleasure. [_gestures to a 
             barstool next to her_] Do you mind? 
    _She complies and he sits down._
    **Heather:** Wait a minute.  Dr. Frasier Crane from the radio?
    **Frasier:** Yes.
    **Heather:** Well, I've heard your show.  You're great! 
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you.
    **Heather:** This is exciting! [_pauses_] Hey, didn't you say on your show 
             the other day that someone had impersonated you at the dry 
             cleaners?
    **Frasier:** Yes, someone did.
    **Heather:** But, how do I know that you're not the impersonator?
    **Frasier:** Oh, good heavens, if you're looking for identification, 
             I... [_reaches for his wallet_] Uh-oh.
    **Heather:** I thought so. [_gets up to leave_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, but, he stole my wallet the other day.
    **Heather:** Who did?
    **Frasier:** Frasier did - the bad Frasier.
    **Heather:** You're pretty sick, you know that?  Maybe you ought to just 
             get a life!
    _She heads for the door.  He follows her._
    **Frasier:** Heather, this is absurd! Can't you recognize my...
    _She's gone before he can get the chance to explain further. 
    He stands at the door for a moment, defeated.  Then, a man enters 
    the bar.  He is nowhere near Frasier's size, but Frasier recognizes 
    the suit.  He slowly looks the man up and down as the man grows more 
    and more nervous._
    **Frasier:** Nice suit.
       **Phil:** Oh my god, it's you! 
    _We recognize his voice as the man who called in to Frasier's show.
    He rushes to the door, but Frasier catches him._
    **Frasier:** Oh, no you don't!  You're mine now!
       **Phil:** All right.  All right, I give up. 
    _He tries to make another dash for it, but Frasier grabs him._
    **Frasier:** Damn it!  How did you find me?
    **Frasier:** Well, a certain Denise called the station today.  She had to 
             cancel your little rendezvous.
       **Phil:** Great.  And I put on my best suit.
    **Frasier:** No. You put on _my_ best suit!
       **Phil:** Well, I guess this is it.  Party's over.  I'm so stupid! [_sits 
             at a table_] You probably want to call the police, huh? 
    **Frasier:** No.  What I would like to do is throttle you until your eyes 
             shoot across the room like champagne corks!  But I won't, 
             because this is still a civilized world.  But it won't be for 
             long if you lowlifes have your way, because with every 
             wallet you steal, you put bars on someone else's windows! 
             With every purse you snatch, you put mace on another key 
             chain!  Everyday you make our lives a little less livable, 
             and I hope that burns on your conscience!  Well, what do you 
             have to say for yourself?
       **Phil:** You're right.
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh... I see.  I see.  You think by agreeing with me, 
             I'll let you off the hook.
       **Phil:** No, I'm saying you're right.  I'm not trying to weasel out of 
             this.  I'm guilty and I deserve what I get.  Look, here's your
             keys.  The car's out front with your briefcase in it. [_pulls 
             out a cell phone_] Here, go ahead and call the police.  That's 
             your new car phone, by the way.  I upgraded.  I should have 
             known things were gonna turn out like this for me.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, here it comes - the old sob story.  "Daddy didn't love 
             me.  Mother ignored me.  The bully next door stole my baseball 
             glove."
       **Phil:** No!  Dad loved me.  Mom spoiled me.  And I _was_ the bully next 
             door. [_gesturing to the phone_] Say, why don't you let me do 
             that, it's kind of tricky. 
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
       **Phil:** There's only one person to blame for my problems and that's 
             me. [_into phone_] Yeah, hi.  The number for the Seattle P.D., 
             please. [_to Frasier_] I take the easy way out of everything, 
             I always have.  And you want to know why?  I'm lazy.  Lazy, 
             lazy, lazy! [_into phone_] Oh, sweetheart, I don't have the 
             energy to look for a pencil.  Could you just connect me? 
             Thanks, hon. 
    **Frasier:** You expect me to believe that your entire life of crime can 
             be attributed to your laziness?
       **Phil:** Hey, it's the truth.  I don't like to work, never have.  And 
             believe me, it's a lot easier to take something than to get 
             a job.  And I'm even a lazy criminal!  A briefcase here, a set 
             of car keys there.  Maybe a little light shoplifting, but a 
             bank robbery?  All that planning and split-second timing?
             Forget it!  And that second-story stuff - the grappling hooks, 
             glass cutters... who does that?! [_into phone_] Yeah, thank 
             you. [_hands phone to Frasier_] You're on hold.
    **Frasier:** Story of my week.  You know, you seem to be taking this 
             awfully well. 
       **Phil:** Well, it's like I said.  It was bound to happen. 
    **Frasier:** Or perhaps... perhaps you wanted to get caught. 
       **Phil:** Huh?
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, think about it.  You've been taking greater and 
             greater risks.  Isn't that the behavior of a man who wants to 
             get caught?
       **Phil:** I'm telling ya, Doc - lazy! [_lifts up his leg_] Look at your 
             pants, for god's sake!  You'd think I'd take them in to be 
             hemmed, right?  Staples! 
    **Frasier:**[_horrified_] Oh, dear god!
       **Phil:** Staples!
    **Frasier:** Well, I still say that you really wanted to get caught. 
             [_sits_] It's a classic cri de couer. 
       **Phil:** Cri de what?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's a ballet, it... it just means that you don't like 
             the life that you're living.
       **Phil:** Well, it's not a great life.  Half the time I don't know 
             where my next month's rent is coming from.  And I haven't 
             been in a solid relationship in I don't know how long. 
    **Frasier:** Then why don't you change?
       **Phil:** Haven't we been over this? [_shouting_] Gimme an "L", gimme an 
             "A"...
    **Frasier:** As a psychiatrist, I just don't buy that.  You're not lazy. 
             What you are is afraid.  There are any number of things you 
             could do in a legitimate world.  You're just afraid to try 
             one of them and fail at it.
       **Phil:** You really think I can change?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I believe everyone can change because I believe in the 
             basic goodness of people. [_into phone_] Oh yes, hello.  Yes, 
             uh...just a moment, please. [_to Phil_] Start now.  Take 
             responsibility for yourself. [_offers the phone to him_] For 
             once, don't take the easy way out. 
       **Phil:**[_into phone_] Hello.  Yeah, I'd like to report a crime. 
    _Frasier looks pleased with himself.  Suddenly, Heather, the woman 
    from the bar, returns with a couple of police officers._
    **Heather:**[_pointing at Frasier_] There he is.  He's the man who's been 
             impersonating Frasier Crane.
    Officer: All right, let's go.
    **Frasier:** Oh, what are you talking about?  I _am_ Frasier Crane! 
    Officer: Do you have identification?
    **Frasier:** Well, no... no.  But it's the truth! [_to Phil_] Tell them.  
       **Phil:** Thank god you got here when you did, officer!  I detained him 
             as long as I could! 
    **Frasier:** What?!
    Officer: [_grabbing Frasier's arm_] Move it!
    **Frasier:** But he's lying!  He's the imposter!  Don't you people 
             recognize me?! 
    _They start dragging him to the door._
    **Frasier:** Oh, for goodness sake!  This is madness!  I can't believe 
             this is happening! [_shouting_] People of the world, listen 
             to me!  Trust no one, especially THAT lazy bastard!
    _END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles walks into the Cafe Nervosa and tries again to hold the door 
    open for the pretty blonde lady.  This time, however, she stops to 
    shake his hand and thank him.  He is clearly pleased with this. 
    She leaves and he then walks over to join Frasier at a table. 
    
    He appears to be very happy about this turn of events.  As he talks, 
    he starts to check the time and realizes his watch is missing.  Knowing 
    that the blonde must have taken it, he jumps up and rushes out the door 
    after her.
