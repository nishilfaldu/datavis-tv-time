    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    **SUNDAY IN THE
    PARK WITH EDDIE**
    [_Fade in.  Daphne is ironing, Martin comes from the kitchen with a beer._]
    
    **Martin:** What the hell are you doing?
    **Daphne:** Ironing your son's socks.
    **Martin:** Why don't you just twist them into little balls like you do 
            mine?
    **Daphne:** He says it bruises the cashmere.  He likes them pressed, 
            folded, then neatly arranged in those sock dividers.  I saw 
            them in a catalogue once, but couldn't imagine who in the 
            world would ever buy such silly things.  Course, I hadn't met 
            Dr. Crane yet.
    **Martin:**[_sitting in his chair_] I used to think there was some sort 
            of mix-up at the hospital.  Of course, when Niles came 
            along it shot that theory all to hell.
    
    [_Frasier comes in from the bedroom._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, Dad, please.  Coaster.  [_puts one under the 
             beer_] Your beer is sweating.
     **Martin:** So am I.  You wanna shove one of those under my can?
    
    [_The doorbell rings, Frasier goes to get it._]
    
    **Daphne:** If he could, he would.
    
    [_Frasier opens the door to a neighbor._]
    
     **Frasier:** Oh, Mrs. Greenway!  What a pleasant surprise.
    **Dorathea:**[_storming in and pointing at Eddie_]  I knew it!  That's 
              him!
     **Frasier:** Won't you come in?
    **Dorathea:** I had to see him again before I was sure, but now I'm 
              positive.  That is the horny little mixed-breed who got my 
              Phoebe pregnant.
      **Martin:** Hey, you can't just bust in here accusing my dog!
    **Dorathea:** Oh, it's him all right!  I had to keep shooing him away 
              from Phoebe down at the park.  Look at him, he doesn't 
              care who's life he's ruined.  All he cares about is his 
              own selfish pleasure!
      **Martin:** You know what your problem is, Dorthea?  You got a bad 
              attitude.  
    **Dorathea:**[_heading back to the door_] Oh!
      **Martin:** That's why nobody sits with you in the park.
    
    [_Eddie jumps over to the couch, staring out the door._]
    
     **Frasier:** Mrs. Greenway, there's no way Eddie could be the father, 
              he's been neutered.
    **Dorathea:** Oh, really?!  Then how do you explain these?
    
    [_She shoves a box of puppies into his arms._]
    
     **Frasier:** Oh, my God!  They're miniature Eddies!
      **Daphne:**[_overcome_] Oh, aren't they adorable?  Oh!
    **Dorathea:** Well, I'm glad you think so, because they're yours! [_leaves_]
     **Frasier:** Oh! [_to Eddie_] Bad dog!  Look what you did!  
    
    [_Eddie jumps back to Martin, Frasier gives the box to Daphne._  ]
    
    **Frasier:** Here, take these.  Dad, Dad, I expect an explanation.  All this time 
             I thought Eddie had been fixed.
     **Martin:** All you had to do was look.
    **Frasier:** Well, I am glad to say I've never been that bored.
     **Daphne:**[_cuddling the puppies_] Ooh, couldn't you just eat them up?
    **Frasier:** Oh, for God's sake, please, don't love them.  They'll think 
             they're staying. [_shoves them back in the box_] Keep them off 
             the couch. [_to Martin_] What were you thinking, letting him 
             run free in the park?  Haven't you ever seen the way he tries 
             to romance my towel warmer?
     **Martin:** Look, he's cooped up here all day.  When we go to the 
             park, I let him off the leash so he can get a little 
             exercise.
    **Frasier:** Apparently, that's not all he got.
     **Daphne:**[_holding out a puppy_] I think I found the perfect name for 
             this one...
    **Frasier:** STOP!  Dogs only need names if you are planning to call 
             them to you, which we are not. [_grabs a puppy that got 
             loose_] Oh, now listen you, you get right back in there, 
             you mangy little thing.  Oh, my God... all right, all 
             right, now I've got to run down to the radio station, 
             but believe me we are going to be having a discussion 
             about this when I get...
     **Martin:** Oh, relax, Frasier.  I'll have Eddie taken care of
             tomorrow.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well you better.  Now, Daphne, give me that box, 
             please.
     **Daphne:** Where are you taking the puppies?
    **Frasier:** To see if I can unload some of them down at the station.
     **Daphne:** Oh, well, couldn't we just keep them for a while?
    **Frasier:** No, no, we don't want them taking after their father.  
    
    [_As he carries the box to the door, all the puppies suddenly stand on their
    hind legs inside the box and look at Frasier._]
    
    **Frasier:** Though it may be too late already.  Oh, for God's sake, 
             STOP STARING AT ME!
    
    [_He leaves.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 2 - KACL_
    
    **CATWOMAN**
    [_Roz is on her side of the booth reading.  Frasier comes in behind her._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz, don't you look lovely...
        **Roz:**[_not looking_] I know what's in the box, and I don't want 
             one.
    **Frasier:** But I didn't say anything!
        **Roz:** Betty from Accounting called to warn me.  Where did you 
             find them, anyway?
    **Frasier:** In my living room.  These are Eddie's mongrel seed.  
             [_crossing to his side of the booth_] You don't know anybody 
             that wants six puppies, do you?
        **Roz:** Six?  All right, Eddie!
    **Frasier:** Oh, please!  I've been traipsing up and down the hallway 
             for an hour, trying to unload them; I haven't had the 
             slightest bit of luck.
        **Roz:** Well, you see Frasier, not everybody likes dogs.  Take me, 
             I'm a cat person.  I mean it's not like I'd ever buy a cat 
             mug or a cat calendar, or anything, but; I had a cat when I 
             was growing up.  We were almost inseparable.  Muffles... or 
             Scruffles, something like that.
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz, it's entirely possible that there's a dog 
             lover inside of you that's just dying to get out.  Don't 
             you think so?  
    
    [_She shakes her head, he picks up a puppy and gives it to her._]
    
    **Frasier:** Come on, come on, just, just take a look, just have a look, 
             let's have a look...
        **Roz:**[_with a melting smile and cooing_] Ooh, he's adorable!  
             Oh, come here little fella.  Oh, aren't you the cutest 
             little thing?  Oh, oh, oh, yeah, give me a little kiss.  
             Ooh, I love you too! [_Then hands the puppy back with a 
             completely flat face; deadpan_] There, happy now?
    **Frasier:** Roz!  How can you just toss him aside after such a tender 
             display of affection?
        **Roz:** I can do it with men, too.  Come on, Frasier, it's time to 
             start the show.
    
    [_Frasier holds the puppy up to a man passing by the window._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Phil, puppy, puppy!  [_Phil wards him off with his hands 
              and keeps walking_] They're all on to me.  All right, now, 
              you guys behave yourselves.
    
    [_He puts on his headphones and Roz cues him through the window._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane coming to you 
              from KACL 780 talk radio.  I'll be with you for the next 
              three hours.  So Roz, who's our first caller?
        **Roz:** We have Rita on line four, she's feeling a little 
              overwhelmed at home.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Rita, I'm listening.
       **Rita:** Yeah, Dr. Crane?  Dr. Crane... I'm, I'm- uh, thank you for 
              taking my call.  I, I, I tell you, I am about to lose my 
              mind.  I am raising four kids by myself, the oldest one is 
              not even seven and the other three are all under five.  
              Between cooking and cleaning and changing diapers and 
              tripping over toys... I, I feel sometimes like I'm about to 
              snap.  What should I do?
    **Frasier:** Have you considered getting a puppy?
    
    [_Roz looks at him in disbelief.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    **UN PEU DE PATE
    DERRIERE LES OREILLES**
    [_There is a family of four, the Thomases, holding one of the puppies 
    and talking with Daphne._]
    
    **Thomas:** Well, if we can't have this one, are there any other 
            puppies available?
    **Daphne:** No, we found homes for all the others.  But thanks for 
            coming over, 'bye now.
    **Thomas:** But, the children.  Dr. Crane said...
    **Daphne:** Oh, don't get all wobbly now.  There are other dogs in the 
            world, you know.  Now give me that. [_takes the dog from 
            the little girl and ushers them out the door_] Thank you 
            for coming over, thank you.
    
    [_She closes the door behind them, Frasier comes in from the kitchen 
    with a tray._]
    
    **Frasier:** I thought you might like some wine and pate, and I made 
             some lemonade for the children...  
    
    [_He looks up and sees no Thomases, only Daphne protectively cuddling 
    the puppy._]
    
    **Frasier:**[_coldly_] Where are the Thomases?  Why is that dog still here?
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, but they struck me as unfit guardians.
    **Frasier:** For God's sake, he works at the zoo!  She's a nurse, 
             Billy's an altar boy and Kathy is a Camp-Fire Girl!
     **Daphne:** They had a dark aura.
    **Frasier:** They had a ten-acre farm!  If they'd have taken me, I'd 
             have gone with them!
     **Daphne:** Oh, I see!  So you want me to give the little fellow away 
             to just anybody. [_The doorbell rings._]
    **Frasier:** Well, no, I'm not saying that.  It's just that he can't 
             stay here.
    
    [_He answers the door.  It is Niles._]
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello, Niles.  Come on in.
      **Niles:** Hope you don't mind my stopping by, but Maris is hosting 
             the Women's League Senior yoga group and... old money in 
             body stockings... [_grimaces_]
    **Frasier:** Say no more, you're welcome to hide out here.
      **Niles:** I see the kennel is still open.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but that's the last one.  I'd even managed to find a 
             nice home for him, but Daphne thought the family wasn't 
             nice enough.  Some pate, Niles?
     **Daphne:** I didn't reject them, the dog did.  Canines have a very 
             keen sense of who's a nice person and who isn't.  Why, 
             many's the time I've chosen a man based solely on the way 
             my mum's springer spaniel took to them.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne, that is preposterous!  Letting a dog choose 
             your dates?
    
    [_When the others aren't looking, Niles takes a dab of pate from his 
    cracker and applies it behind his ears._]
    
     **Daphne:** It's true!  If a dog likes a man, it's a good bet he's warm 
             and sensitive.
      **Niles:**[_going to the couch and taking the puppy from Daphne_] You 
             know, I really didn't get a good look at this little tyke.  
             Come here, boy, come to your Uncle Niles.  
    
    [_The puppy begins licking behind his ear._]
    
     **Daphne:** Look at that!  He's taken quite a shine to you.
      **Niles:** Yes, happens all the time.
    **Frasier:** Daphne, would you mind taking the dog away, please?  Get 
             back on the phone with the Thomases, tell them we've 
             reconsidered.
     **Daphne:**[_taking the puppy_] All right.  But only for a two-week trial.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.
     **Daphne:** Come along, Basil.
    **Frasier:** I told you not to name them!
    
    [_Daphne exits.  Martin comes in with Eddie._]
    
     **Niles:** Ooh, hello, Dad.
    **Martin:** Afternoon, boys.
    
    [_Martin undoes Eddie's leash.  He jumps on the coffee table and 
    scurries over to Martin's chair._]
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie had a little appointment 
             down at the vet's.  Can't help but notice he still has that 
             certain spring in his step.  
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, we started heading down there, but the traffic 
             was a bear, you know.  You get a sunny day in this town and 
             everybody forgets how to drive.   
    
    [_He goes into the powder room._]
    
    **Frasier:** You are going to reschedule, aren't you?
     **Martin:**[_through the door_] Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll call in the 
             morning.
    **Frasier:** That's the second time you've canceled that appointment.  
             What seems to be the problem?
     **Martin:** Oh, it's no problem.  What's the big deal?  I'll call 
             tomorrow.  Relax, will ya?
    
    [_Eddie jumps on the couch beside Niles and begins licking behind his 
    other ear._]
    
      **Niles:** Oh, dear God, he's licking me!
    **Frasier:** Eddie, just stop! [_He shoos Eddie away, then grabs Niles's 
             head for a closer look._] Oh, Niles, you have liver behind 
             your ears.
      **Niles:** I imagine I must have picked up a cracker and inadvertently  
             scratched behind my ear.
    **Frasier:** So you're telling me that you had a wad of cold meat behind 
             your ears and didn't feel it?
      **Niles:** That's the story I'm sticking with, yes.
    
    [_Martin comes out._]
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, Dad, listen: I want your assurance that you'll take 
             care of this.
     **Martin:** Fine.
    **Frasier:** You promise?
     **Martin:** Hey!  I said I'd do it and I will.  You don't have to pin 
             a note to my sweater, get off my back!  Anybody wants me, 
             I'll be down at Duke's. [_He leaves._]
      **Niles:** Ever notice how much faster he moves when he's wrong?
    **Frasier:** Apparently he's got some sort of psychological block 
             against taking Eddie down there.  Guess I'm gonna have 
             to do it.  Somebody has to be responsible in this family.  
             OK, come on, Eddie let's go.  Good boy. [_Eddie runs over 
             to the kitchen table._] Eddie?  Uh, Niles... [_He 
             motions for Niles to help him._]
      **Niles:**[_coming around the other side_] Now Eddie, it's a routine 
             operation.  They say it's almost painless, [_to Frasier_] 
             although I can't imagine...
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, perhaps it's best we don't discuss the 
             operation.  We might spook him
      **Niles:** Excuse me?  Are you saying he understands me?
    **Frasier:** Well, he understands the word B - A - T - H.  God knows how 
             much english he's picked up.  
      **Niles:** Fine.  _Tu tournes a droit._
    **Frasier:** _Ah, bon, bon.  Je marcherai derriere lui.._
      **Niles:** _Mais, tu es celui qui va l'amener chez le medecin pour le...
             snip-snip._
    **Frasier:** Ah.  _C'es vrais, mais..._ oh, what are we doing?  Eddie, come
             here! This is ridiculous.  Look at him.  Oh, for Pete's
             sake.
    
    [_Eddie races away to the bedrooms as Niles and Frasier give chase._]
    
    _Act 2
    
    Scene 1 - The Vet's Office_
    
    **DOCTOR!  NO!**
    [_Frasier is sitting in the reception area, Eddie is on the chair 
    beside him, staring at him intently._]
    
    **Frasier:** What are you staring at?  You know why you're here, don't 
             you?  Well now, listen, it's for your own good.  Believe me 
             you'll be much happier afterwards.  Look, your day-to-day 
             routine, it'll be exactly the same.  You'll be able to 
             sleep, run around with your little buddies, go play in the 
             woods, chase the birds, lick your... did I mention sleep?
    
    [_Martin comes in the door._]
    
     **Martin:** You've got a lot of nerve, you know that?!  You all right, 
             boy?
    **Frasier:** Well, of course he's all right, Dad.  Why are you getting so 
             upset?  I'm only doing this to help you out.
     **Martin:** Oh, that's a load of crap.
    **Frasier:** Look, we agreed that this had to be done, right?  Now, you 
             seem to be have a problem with it, so I took charge.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't need you taking charge.  Eddie's my dog, so 
             mind your own damn business.  And here's something else you 
             should know: I don't need your help and I don't want it!
    **Frasier:** Why are you so upset?  It doesn't matter who brought him 
             down here.
     **Martin:** Yes it does!  I'm perfectly capable of taking care of him.  
             Just like I feed him, walk him and give him his bath!  
    
    [_A man comes in and leaves the door open.  Eddie runs out_]  
    
     **Martin:** Eddie!  See what you did!
    **Frasier:** Me?!
    
    [_They rush out the door.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment_
    
    [_Martin is on the phone._]
    
    **Martin:** OK.  Thanks, and oh, Daphne's here in case anybody sees him.  
            [_hangs up_] I got the guys at the station circulating Eddie's 
            picture.  I'm gonna go out and look for him so more.
    
    _Daphne comes out of the kitchen with a tray._
    
    **Daphne:** Oh, come on, now.  You've done enough.  Why don't you just 
            sit still and drink your tea?
    **Martin:** I hate tea!
    **Daphne:** Humor me.  In an emergency, it's all I know how to do.
    **Martin:** That's a real comfort coming from a health care provider.
    
    [_Frasier comes in the front door.  Martin and he share an 
    uncomfortable look._]
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, I'm sorry.  There was no luck at the pound.  They said 
             they'd call if they find a dog matching Eddie's description. 
             [_spotting a flyer by the phone_] A five hundred dollar reward 
             for Eddie?!  
    
    [_Martin glares at him._]
    
    **Frasier:** Are you sure it's enough?
     **Martin:** Right now it's about five hundred more than I'd pay to get 
             you back.
    **Frasier:** Look, Dad, I said I was sorry.
     **Martin:** Well, I just can't sit here.  I'm goin' back to the park.
    **Frasier:** The park again?  What makes you think he's gonna show up 
             there?
     **Martin:** Because that's his hangout.  Didn't you ever have a place 
             like that?  A place where you went to meet women, a place 
             where you got lucky?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose so, yeah.
     **Martin:** Didn't you go back?
    **Frasier:**[_with feigned enthusiasm_] To the park!
     **Martin:** This time we'll comb every inch of that place.  Every tree, 
             every bush... uh, Daphne, we're gonna need more help, so 
             call Niles and tell him we'll pick him up. [_she nods_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, wouldn't want to go out in the wilds without one 
             of the world's great outdoorsmen!
     **Daphne:**[_holding her head_] Oh, this is odd.  I just got one of my 
             psychic flashes.  It's about Eddie.
     **Martin:** Well?
     **Daphne:** It doesn't make any sense.  All I'm getting is a picture of 
             Eddie sitting with Dr. Crane.
    
    [_Cut to - a bus bench with an ad for Frasier's show.  Eddie is 
    sitting on it, staring at Frasier's picture.  Fade out._]
    
    _Scene 3 - The Park_
    
    **THE STAKEOUT**
    [_Martin is sitting in Frasier's car, Frasier climbs in._]
    
     **Martin:** Any luck?
    **Frasier:** I couldn't find him.
     **Martin:** Where's Niles?
    **Frasier:** Ah, we split up to cover more ground.
     **Martin:** Well, scrunch down.  If Eddie comes back and sees you here, 
             he'll run away again.
    
    [_Fraser slumps down in the seat with an embarrassed look on his 
    face._]
    
    **Frasier:**  You know, Dad, maybe we oughta call it a night.  You've been
              sittin' in this car for three hours.
     **Martin:**  Ah, that's nothin'.  I was on a stakeout once for fifteen
              hours without ever gettin' out of the car.  We had a contest
              to see who could last the longest.  The winner was "Canteen"
              McHugh.  Know why we called him that?
    **Frasier:**  I think I can guess.
     **Martin:**  Because his bladder was the size of a canteen.
    **Frasier:**  Thank you for clearing that up.
     **Martin:**  You could've slung his bladder over your shoulder and gone
              on a twenty mile forced march through the desert.
    **Frasier:**  Big, huh?
     **Martin:**  Isn't that what I've been sayin'?
    
    [_Frasier rolls his window down._]
    
     **Martin:**  Hey, close that window!  It's freezin'!
    **Frasier:**  Oh, Dad, it's like a blast furnace in here.
     **Martin:**  Well, I'm cold, okay?  At my age, you get cold easily.
    **Frasier:**  All right.
    
    [_He rolls the window back up._]
    
    **Frasier:**  You know Dad, I've just developed a very intersting theory
              about you...
     **Martin:**  [_sarcastic_] If I begged you, would you share it with me?
    **Frasier:**  If that's your attitude, just forget it!
    
    [_The car phone rings and Frasier answers it._]
    
    **Frasier:** Hello?  Oh, Niles!
     **Martin:** Did he find him?!
    **Frasier:** Just a second, Niles, let me put you on speaker-phone here.  
             Hang on. [_he sets the phone down_] OK, go ahead, Niles.
      **Niles:**[_from the phone_] I'm out here in the middle of the park 
             and I'm lost!  Thank God for my cellular!
     **Martin:** Did you see Eddie?
      **Niles:** No, but I thought I saw a raccoon.  When I stopped running, 
             I had no idea where I was.  You've got to help me!
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, Niles, just, just remain calm.  Let me 
             think back to my Boy Scout training. [_opens the car sun-roof_] 
             All right, now, we're on the northeast corner of the park... 
             all right, look into the heavens and see if you can spot the 
             North Star.  Then you want to turn twelve degrees to your 
             right... 
     **Martin:** Oh, for God's sake, just walk towards the horn. [_begins 
             honking_]
      **Niles:** I hear it!  I hear it, Dad!  I'm walking.
     **Martin:** All right, just keep following it. [_honks again_]
      **Niles:** I see a grove of trees, and a fountain, and... a horrible, 
             wretched, hunchbacked old man!  Stay away from me!  No, no, 
             it was just a bush.  OK, OK, things are beginning to look 
             familiar now.  Keep honking.  I think I'm homing in.  Yes, 
             I'm quite sure this is the way.  
    
    [_He climbs into the back seat, still talking into his cellular._]
    
      **Niles:** OK, you can hang up now. [_hangs his up_] That was a harrowing 
             experience!
     **Martin:** Yeah, a shrub and a raccoon in one night and you lived to 
             tell about it.
      **Niles:** Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie.  I hope you'll 
             understand, I think I'd like to go home now and hold my 
             wife.  That is, if she'll let me.  I'll just hail a cab.
    **Frasier:** Be sure to call us from the curb when you get there, so we 
             know you're safe.
    
    [_Niles gets out._]
    
     **Martin:** Hey, you're probably tired too.  If you want to go with 
             him, that's OK.
    **Frasier:** No, that's all right, Dad.  I'll stay for a little while 
             longer.
     **Martin:** Look, I'm sorry I cut you off like that before, I've just 
             never gone in for that psychological mumbo-jumbo.  Probably
             started back on the force when they'd make us go see The 
             Squirrel.
    **Frasier:** Who?
     **Martin:** Dr. Bergman, the department shrink.  We called him "The 
             Squirrel" 'cause guys got sent to him when they got 
             squirrelly.  He'd show you a bunch of ink-blots and ask 
             about your toilet habits...  If I wanted to talk about 
             toilet habits, I woulda stayed partners with Nate 
             Dombrowski.  We nicknamed him "The Big..."
    **Frasier:** Thank you!
     **Martin:** Look, it wasn't just Eddie I was mad about.  Eddie was the 
             straw that broke the camel's back.  Seems like I'm always 
             being told to take my feet off the furniture, put a coaster 
             under my beer, turn the TV down... I used to make the 
             rules, and now I have to follow them.  This makin' any 
             sense to you?
    **Frasier:** From a psychological standpoint, it makes perfect sense.  
             Slowly, over the years, your responsibilities have been 
             taken away from you, and you, well, you feel symbolically 
             castrated.
     **Martin:** Oh, why does everything with you shrinks start in the 
             crotch?
    **Frasier:** All right, all right.  Well, maybe my rules are too rigid.  
             Maybe I should try to relax a little.
     **Martin:** No, no.  Hey, it's your house, you do what you want.  I don't 
             know what's buggin' me.  I guess it's not easy for a guy like 
             me to not be in charge.
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, a lot of people confuse not being in charge 
             with not being respected.  I hope you're not making that 
             mistake, because you command a great deal of respect. 
             There's not a day in my life when I don't hold myself up to 
             the Martin Crane yardstick.  I guess a son always wants to 
             make his father proud.
     **Martin:** Yeah, I guess.
    **Frasier:** So...?
     **Martin:** Yeah, yeah, you're doin' fine.  [_muttering_]  Even if you 
             are a big pain in the ass.
    **Frasier:** You know, I'm not sure I could have made Eddie go through 
             with that operation, anyway.  That's a tough thing for a 
             guy to do to another guy.
     **Martin:** Amen to that.
    
    [_Eddie jumps up on the trunk of the car, Frasier spots him in the 
    rear-view mirror._]
    
    **Frasier:** You know what?  It's getting kinda late.  What do you say 
             we go home and get some sleep?
    
    [_Eddie barks._]
    
     **Martin:**[_opening his door_] Eddie!  Hey, hey, come here boy! [_Eddie 
             jumps in and sits on his lap._]  Hey, atta boy!  Hey, good 
             to see you fella, how ya doin'? [_to Frasier_] It might be 
             nice if you welcomed him back.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Eddie. [_pets him_] Good dog - oh, wet dog!
     **Martin:** Yeah, you're shivering! [_grabs some clothing from the back 
             seat and wraps it around Eddie_] Here, we gotta get you         
             warmed up!
    **Frasier:** Dad!  That's a hundred percent cashmere pull-over!  [_Martin 
             glares at him_]  It's meant to be worn with the collar up.  
    
    [_He adjusts it on Eddie.  Fade out._]
    
    **Credits:**  
    
    Back in the vet's waiting room, Frasier, Martin and Niles are all 
    there with Eddie.  The nurse calls to them but they don't move.  She 
    comes around the counter, picks Eddie up and takes him back to the 
    operating areas, Eddie looking back over her shoulder at the men.  
    The guys have their hands in their laps and looks of sympathy and 
    nervousness on their faces.  Together they cross their legs.
