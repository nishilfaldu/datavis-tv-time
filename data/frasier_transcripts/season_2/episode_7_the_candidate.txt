    _ACT ONE_
    
    **ANDY WARHOL SAID IT BEST**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's apartment._
    Frasier, Niles and Daphne are sitting on the couch. Martin is 
    standing behind them.  Their attentions are tuned towards the 
    television._
    
       **Martin:** All right, now.  Quiet, it's getting ready to start.
    **Announcer:** The following is a paid political announcement for Holden 
               Thorpe.
        **Niles:** You dragged us over here to see a commercial for Holden 
               Thorpe?
       **Martin:** Shh! 
      **Frasier:** The man is a fascist.  He's like Himmler without the whimsy.
    
    _Niles laughs at this, but Martin taps Frasier on the head with his 
    cane to shut him up.  Cut to the TV commercial, which shows an 
    American flag and the title HOLDEN THORPE FOR CONGRESS._
    
    **Announcer:** And now another American for Holden Thorpe.
       **Martin:**[_on television_] Hi, I'm Marty Crane. 
      **Frasier:** Oh, dear God.
       **Martin:**[_on television_] For thirty years I was a cop walking 
               The beat in Seattle.  Then my hip was shattered by an 
               assassin's bullet - an assassin who wouldn't have been 
               on the streets if it weren't for those bleeding hearts 
               we sent to Congress. 
    
    _Martin is mouthing the words along with his TV self._
    
     **Martin:** I used to carry a gun.  Now I carry a cane.  I'm voting to 
             elect Holden Thorpe.  He's running because I can't. 
    
    _Frasier and Niles look horrified._
    
     **Martin:** Well?
     **Daphne:** Oh, Mr. Crane, I don't know what to say. I'm in a state of 
             shock.
      **Niles:** Aren't we all?
     **Daphne:** I mean, you were wonderful! [_she hugs him_] This calls for 
             a celebration.  What'll you have?
     **Martin:** Oh, give me a beer.
    
    _Daphne goes to the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad... how did this happen?
     **Martin:** Well, I took a walk to the park last week and they were 
             having a rally for Thorpe.  So I started to talk to one of 
             his people and told him I was an ex-cop and the next thing 
             you know they were shoving a camera in my face. 
    **Frasier:** This is appalling.  Those people are exploiting you.
     **Martin:** No, they're not.  I like Thorpe.
      **Niles:** Oh, how could you support that odious little hosehead?  
             I once heard him say, "Cancer aside, tobacco is good for 
             the economy."
     **Martin:** Well, I like him.  He's gonna put more cops on the street.
     **Daphne:**[_bringing Martin his beer_] Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt. 
             Now that everyone and his brother's walking around armed. 
             Makes me glad we don't have so many guns in England.
    **Frasier:** You don't need guns, you've got kidney pie. [_The phone 
             rings_] Hello? [_to Martin_] It's Duke. 
     **Martin:** Oh!
      **Niles:** Sherry?
    **Frasier:** I couldn't possibly, Niles.  I'm too upset. 
    
    _He and Niles sit down at the table to play chess._
    
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, yeah.  I'm glad you liked it, Duke.  Yeah, it was 
             fun.  Hey, I got a lot of showbiz secrets to tell you.  You 
             know they can make you cry on cue by pulling a hair out of 
             your nose?  What?  Really?  Oh, guys, quick, over here-
             channel 14, they're running my other spot!  Hey, Duke, this 
             one was my idea.  Remember when Lyndon Johnson lifted up 
             his shirt to show his scar? 
    
    _He turns up the T.V._
    
     **Martin:**[_v.o._] Hi, I'm Marty Crane.  Crime isn't pretty.  And if you 
             don't believe me, look at this! 
    
    _Niles and Frasier turn just in time to see whatever "this" is. 
    They both gasp in horror.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    _Scene Two -- Cafe Nervosa. 
    Frasier is standing at the bar of the cafe.  A waitress comes up 
    to take his order._
    
    **Waitress:** Can I help you, sir?
     **Frasier:** Yes, what are your specials today?
    **Waitress:** Kenyan blend.
     **Frasier:** No, no, no, no.  Still poaching elephants over there.  
              Got something else?
    **Waitress:** Dark roast Brazilian. 
     **Frasier:** Not until they do something about the loss of our 
              rainforests.
    **Waitress:** Salvadoran?
     **Frasier:** No, I've never forgiven them for their human rights 
              violations.
    **Waitress:** Well, then we're down to the Hawaiian Kona blend.  Or, have 
              they slaughtered too many macadamia nuts?
     **Frasier:**[_gives her a look, then_] That'll be fine, thank you. 
    
    _Niles walks up behind him._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier, I can't stand it.  I just walked by an electronics 
             store and there in the window were twenty-two television sets 
             and on every screen was Dad's... [_looks around_]...butt. 
    **Frasier:**[_nods_] I saw it.  I don't know which is worse - seeing his 
             butt, or what it stands for.  I just can't believe that our 
             father is actually endorsing that self-serving fearmonger. 
             [_they sit at a table_]
      **Niles:** I've been giving this a lot of thought.  And I realized Dad 
             isn't the problem.  He's just supporting the candidate of 
             his choice.  The problem lies with us. 
    **Frasier:** Us?  We haven't done anything.
      **Niles:** Exactly.  "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil 
             is for good men to do nothing."
    **Frasier:** Edmund Burke.
      **Niles:** I have that quotation in a frame.  I keep meaning to put it 
             up in my office but I never seem to get around to it. [_the 
             waitress brings Frasier's coffee_] Anyway, Frasier, I think 
             the time has come for you and me to get involved. 
    **Frasier:** What are you suggesting?
      **Niles:** I propose we throw our support behind Thorpe's opponent, 
             Phil Patterson.
    **Frasier:** Well, of course I intend to vote for Patterson. 
      **Niles:** I had something a little more ambitious in mind.  I spoke to 
             some people down at Patterson's headquarters this morning, 
             and your name came up.  They'd like you to film a TV spot 
             endorsing their candidate.
    **Frasier:** Niles, listen.  I'd really love to help, but surely you must 
             realize that as a radio psychiatrist, I can't take a chance 
             of alienating my listeners.  The people that need my help 
             might be reluctant to call in if they knew my political 
             views. 
      **Niles:** Well, I wish you'd at least think about it.  A candidate 
             like this doesn't come along that often.  He's hard-working. 
             He volunteers weekends at a soup kitchen.  He really cares 
             about people.  Finally, a politician who believes in the 
             things we believe in.
    
    _A young boy approaches with boxes of candy._
    
        **Boy:** Buy a box of chocolate - send a kid to camp?
      **Niles:** Excuse me, can't you see we're talking here?!
    
    _The boy slumps off as Frasier gives Niles a look._
    
    _Scene Three - KACL.
    Frasier is doing his show._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you for your call, Susan.  We'll be right back after 
             this message. 
    _He puts in a commercial, which happens to be an ad for Holden Thorpe._
     **Thorpe:**[_sound of sirens and guns_] Crime - it's epidemic.  
             It strikes fast and it can strike you.  I'm Holden 
             Thorpe. You should send me to Washington because...
    **Frasier:**[_cutting off the sound_] It's better than having you here!
        **Roz:**[_entering Frasier's booth_] Piece of work, isn't he?  He makes 
             it sound like it's either vote for him or be found murdered 
             in your bed. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I wouldn't be concerned if I were you, Roz.  What are the 
             chances of finding you there alone?
    
    _Bulldog enters with his cart of tricks._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, sports fan, how they hangin'?
    **Frasier:** Okay, Bulldog.
    **Bulldog:** I was talking to Roz. 
    
    _Bulldog smacks Roz on the behind, and, as she spins round in fury, 
    sticks his tongue out at her.  She grabs the tongue and smacks it 
    with the sharp corner of the cart in her hand._
    
        **Roz:** Ten seconds.
    
    _She goes into her booth as Frasier turns up the volume on the 
    commercial for Holden Thorpe._
    
     **Thorpe:** So vote for me.  My crime program will give the streets back 
             to the people-
    **Frasier:**[_cuts it off; on air_] That's good.  Because with your tax 
             program, that's where they'll be sleeping!  Welcome back, 
             Seattle.  We'll be back for just one more phone call after 
             this news break.  And then next up, Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe- 
             [_Bulldog blows his whistle and bangs a gong in Frasier's ear_] 
             and the Gonzo Sports Show. [_off air_] I've asked you not to do 
             that!
    **Bulldog:** Way to be impartial, Doc. [_honks horn_] You know, I happen to 
             think Thorpe's a good man.  Who you voting for, that pretty 
             boy Phil Patterson?
        **Roz:**[_enters_] Yeah, Patterson's great.  His reapportionment plan 
             makes a lot of sense.
    **Frasier:** Forget it, Roz.  He's happily married. 
    
    _She bares her claws at Frasier and then goes back to her booth._
    
    **Bulldog:**[_chuckling_] Yeah, so's Thorpe.  Go figure.  His wife's a cow 
             and he still loves her. 
    **Frasier:** There's a bumper sticker.
    **Bulldog:** Be back in a minute. [_leaves_]
        **Roz:**[_through the glass_] Hey, I liked that little shot you took 
             at Thorpe.  Although our next caller doesn't seem to share 
             your opinion. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, really?  Well, put him on.  I welcome contrasting 
             viewpoints. [_on air_] Hello, Seattle, we're back.  Roz, who do 
             we have on the line?
        **Roz:** On line one we have Holden Thorpe. 
    
    _Roz grins, but Frasier does not look very happy._
    
        **Roz:** Go ahead, caller.
     **Thorpe:**[_v.o._] Crane, Thorpe.  Let me ask you something.  Are you 
             married?
    **Frasier:** Divorced.
     **Thorpe:** You ever serve in the military?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually, I have congenitally weak ankles, it's a 
             family problem.
     **Thorpe:** I see, I see.  So a guy like you - unmarried, didn't serve his 
             country - sees fit to criticize a patriotic family man who 
             fought in the Battle of Grenada.  I went in on the first 
             wave, by the way.
    **Frasier:** On a surfboard, I suppose?
    
    _Roz grins and nods._
    
     **Thorpe:** If you ask me, the day we get the likes of you off the radio 
             will be the day America will be a nice, friendly place to 
             live again. 
    **Frasier:** All right, you've said your piece, now you're gonna listen 
             to mine! [_Thorpe hangs up_] Hang up on me, will you?!  Well, 
             all right, even though you may not be listening, the people 
             of Seattle are gonna hear what I have to say!
        **Roz:** No, they won't.  The show ended five seconds ago, I had to 
             send it to traffic.
    
    _Frasier angrily throws off his headphones.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **CITIZEN CRANE**
    
    _Scene Four - Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier is in the process of rehearsing a political commercial in 
    his apartment. It's filled with lights and sound equipment and 
    various crew.  Niles is among them.  Frasier is seated in the 
    chair near the balcony door.  He is at first facing the balcony, 
    but he then turns to face the camera._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello there.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  Many of you know me 
             from my radio show, but today I'm speaking to you as a
             concerned citizen. [_stands_] As a mental health expert, I've 
             been listening to what my good friend Phil Patterson has to 
             say.  I like the way his mind works.  He's a visionary, and he 
             cares about the little people.  That's why I'm proud to say 
             that I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress. 
    
    _Phil Patterson comes up to him and shakes his hand._
    
       **Phil:** Thanks, Frasier. [_facing camera_] Together, we can live the 
             dream. 
    **Frasier:** Phil Patterson: the sane choice.
    
    _The crew cuts._
    
    **Director:** Okay, guys.  Give us about five minutes to adjust the lights 
              and then we'll shoot it.
     **Frasier:** Great.
       **Niles:** Yes, yes, adjust those lights.  They need to be, uh, lighter 
              and... you know, brighter.
    _He trips over one of the lights.  A crewman grabs it before it falls 
    and gives Niles a look.  Niles, Frasier and Phil walk over to the 
    dinner table._
    
       **Phil:** Thanks again, Frasier.
      **Niles:** Oh, our pleasure, Phil.  The Crane family has a long history 
             of political involvement.  You know, my wife Maris actually 
             has all our servants down at your campaign headquarters 
             licking envelopes.  She'd do it herself, but the poor thing 
             can't produce saliva. 
    
    _Niles exits to the kitchen as Frasier and Patterson share a look. 
    Daphne then enters with Eddie._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, there.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne... I thought we agreed you'd keep him out of here 
             for two hours.
     **Daphne:** Well, I walked him around the park, but you know how he 
             gets.  He starts whining and whimpering until you can't stand 
             it any longer.
       **Phil:**[_bending down to pet Eddie_] Oh, don't let them talk about 
             you like that, little fella.
     **Martin:**[_coming in the door_] She was talking about me.  Hi, Marty 
             Crane. 
       **Phil:** Phil Patterson. [_they shake hands_] You look familiar, Mr. 
             Crane, but I can't quite place you.  
     **Martin:** Oh, let me give you a hint. 
    
    _He starts to pull down his pants._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad! [_he shoos Martin away_]
     **Martin:** Just trying to help the guy!
    **Frasier:** My father did a commercial for your opponent. 
       **Phil:** Yes, it came back to me.
     **Daphne:** Hello, Daphne Moon. 
       **Phil:** Hi. [_shakes hands_]
     **Daphne:** You know, my uncle was a political writer for one of those 
             London tabloids.  I can still remember his biggest scoop.  
             The headline read: "High-ranking politician caught wearing 
             women's clothing."  Of course, you turn to page two and you 
             found out it was Margaret Thatcher, but by then you'd 
             already bought the paper.
       **Phil:**[_struggling for words_] Well, thank you, Miss Moon. 
             [_she leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Say, Phil, it's getting a little hot in here.  You want to 
             step out on to the balcony with me, get a little fresh air?
       **Phil:** Great. [_as they walk out_] Oh, beautiful view.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  Yes, you know, I feel very lucky living here.  
             I'd like to say I feel lucky to be a part of your campaign 
             as well.
       **Phil:** Oh, it's me who's lucky.  It's quite a boost for an underdog 
             to get an endorsement from Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know if my name carries that much weight.
       **Phil:** Oh, come on, people love you.  I've listened to your show. 
             To tell the truth, I've even thought of calling in. 
    **Frasier:** Really?  What for?
       **Phil:** Oh, it's... kind of sensitive.
    **Frasier:** Listen, Phil, as a psychiatrist, anything you tell me will 
             be kept in the strictest confidence. 
    _Phil still hesitates.  They both stare out at the view, not looking 
    at each other._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, it's funny how the more you bottle things up 
             inside, the bigger they seem to be. 
       **Phil:** Well, I've never told anybody this before, but... okay, here 
             goes.  Six years ago... I was abducted by aliens. 
    
    _Frasier, shocked, slowly turns his head to face Phil. 
    He is completely stunned._
    
    **Frasier:** Aliens?
       **Phil:** They transported me up to their spaceship for a kind of 
             conference.  They're very concerned about what we're doing to 
             our planet. [_Frasier stares at Phil_] Hey, you were right. 
             Now that I've said it out loud, it doesn't seem like that 
             big a deal.
    **Frasier:**[_far away_] No...
    _Phil gives Frasier a pat on the back as Niles walks up to the door._
    
      **Niles:** They're ready for you, gentlemen.  Come on in here and let's 
             elect a Congressman!
    
    _Phil exits to the living room, but Frasier is frozen._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier? [_He gestures for Frasier to come in, but he doesn't 
             move_] Frasier?
    
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **LET'S JUST KEEP THIS
    UNDER OUR SPACE HELMETS**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's apartment.
    It is a few moments after Phil's revelation. Frasier is now filming 
    the political commercial.  He looks mortified._
    
    **Director:** We're rolling.  And... action.
     **Frasier:**[_in his chair_] Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. Many of you 
              know me from my radio show but today I'm speaking to you as 
              a concerned citizen... a deeply concerned citizen. 
    
    _Niles looks confused._
    
    **Frasier:** As a mental health expert, I've been listening to what my good 
             friend Phil Patterson has to say. [_stands_] I like the 
             way his mind works.  He's a visionary, and he cares about... 
             [_whimpering_] ...the little people. 
    
    _Daphne and Martin share a confused look._
    
    **Frasier:** That's why I'm proud to say that I'm behind Phil Patterson 
             for Congress.
    
    _Phil walks up to Frasier.  This time, Frasier jumps in fear_
    
        **Phil:** Thanks, Frasier. [_shakes his hand and faces the camera_] 
              Together, we can live the dream.
     **Frasier:** Phil Patterson: [_almost in tears_] The sane choice.
    **Director:** Okay, cut it!
     **Frasier:** God, I'm burning up! 
    
    _He runs to the powder room to get a washcloth._
    
    **Director:** Frasier, you were a little nervous on that one. Why don't 
              you take a couple of minutes and we'll try it again.
      **Martin:** I got mine on the first take.
       **Niles:** Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen? 
    
    _They both exit to the kitchen._
    
      **Niles:** What's going on in there?  You look like a zombie!
    **Frasier:** Oh God, Niles!  I've got something I'd really like to get 
             off my chest. [_sits at a bar stool_] But if I told you I'd 
             be violating a doctor-patient confidence.
      **Niles:** Oh, I see.  Well, nothing is more sacrosanct than our
             professional ethics. [_sits opposite Frasier_] Fortunately, I 
             know a trick to get around them.  For the next few minutes, 
             I'll be your psychiatrist, and then you can spill your guts 
             with impunity.
    **Frasier:** Well, it's borderline, but I'm desperate!
      **Niles:** All right.
    **Frasier:** Just now, on the balcony, Phil Patterson told me that he 
             had been... abducted by aliens. [_Niles stares_] Apparently, 
             he was beamed up to the mother ship, for a little 
             interplanetary chitchat!
    
    _Niles leans around to look outside the kitchen.  He then leans back 
    to look at Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** This is bad, isn't it?
    **Frasier:** Niles, this is incredible.  It's just awful.  We're gonna look 
             like such idiots!
      **Niles:** We?!  The whole thing was your idea.  I knew I should never 
             have let you get me into politics!
    **Frasier:** My idea?! 
    
    _They argue over each other for a moment._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, Niles, stop it!  This isn't getting us anywhere! 
      **Niles:** All right, what are we going to do?
    **Frasier:** Well, I think we have to convince Phil to drop out of the 
             race and seek professional help.
      **Niles:** If Phil drops out, then Thorpe will win.
    **Frasier:** Forget it, Niles!
      **Niles:** Well, then you can forget education, and the environment, 
             and funding for the arts... 
    **Frasier:** Are you saying I should still back Phil?
      **Niles:** All right.  Answer me this: can you tell me with any 
             certainty that in such a vast universe there isn't 
             intelligent life on other planets?
    **Frasier:**[_glares_] At the moment, I'm not sure there's intelligent
             life in this kitchen!
      **Niles:** All right, all right, all right.  Let's assume that it's in 
             his imagination.  How often does he see these aliens?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's only happened the one time. 
    
    _Niles gets a hopeful look, and Frasier also gets excited._
    
    **Frasier:** Which might suggest that it was an isolated incident brought 
             on by overwork rather than a pattern of paranoid delusion.
      **Niles:** My diagnosis exactly!
    **Frasier:** Phil has worked hard.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** He deserves his chance.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** He's still gotta seek professional help.
      **Niles:**[_forceful_] Yes!  The best there is.  But we're not going to 
             turn our backs on him three weeks before the election.
    **Frasier:** No, damn it, we are not. [_they shake hands_] So, will you 
             treat him?
      **Niles:**[_as they exit_] Are you kidding?  I'm a doctor, not a miracle 
             worker! 
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE FAULT LIES NOT IN OUR STARS,
    BUT IN OURSELVES**
    
    _Scene Two - KACL.
    Frasier and Roz are in her booth during a commercial break. 
    She is plucking her eyebrows._
    
        **Roz:** I think it's time I get my eyebrows waxed.  I'm starting to 
             get that Romanian peasant look again.  Of course, it doesn't 
             help that I didn't get any sleep last night.
    **Frasier:** Dating a snorer?
        **Roz:** You know, Frasier, I'm getting just a little tired of your 
             constant insinuation that I sleep around.  I didn't get any 
             sleep because of that idiot Chopper Dave.  When he gets bored 
             doing traffic reports he likes to buzz people's apartments 
             in his helicopter.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I can see how that would be annoying.
        **Roz:** Well, it didn't bother me much, but the guy I was with is a 
             Vietnam vet and he started having flashbacks. 
    
    _Frasier gives her a look as Bulldog bursts in._
    
    **Bulldog:** Greetings, losers!  Have you heard the great news?
    **Frasier:** What, one of your overpaid idols passed his urine test? 
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, laugh all you can.  Word's out about your pal Patterson 
             and those aliens of his.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my God!
        **Roz:** What aliens?
    **Bulldog:** It's all over TV!
    **Frasier:** How did they find out?
    **Bulldog:** What, are you kidding?  You can't keep something like this 
             quiet.  Every station in town is serving his bleeding heart 
             up on a platter. 
    **Frasier:** Isn't that just like the media?  The day before the election 
             they find one tiny flaw in a man and they try to ruin his 
             career!  Well, you know what?  I have my own conduit to the 
             public's ear.  I'm not letting Phil go down without a fight! 
             [_he storms into his booth_]
        **Roz:** What aliens?
    **Bulldog:** Turns out Patterson's got a couple of illegal aliens from 
             Guatemala working in his house.  No greencards, no documents, 
             no chance! 
    
    _He exits._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Hello, Seattle. I'm back.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane 
             and I have just learned during the commercial break that it 
             has become public knowledge that Phil Patterson, candidate 
             for Congress, believes in aliens from outer space. 
    
    _Roz looks up, stunned._
    
    **Frasier:** Not only does he believe in them, he believes he has met with 
             them.  That he was beamed aboard their spaceship for a little 
             interplanetary t�te-�-t�te. [_Roz shakes her head at him to 
             stop_] Shocked?  Well, all right. [_Roz knocks on the glass, he 
             ignores her_] But I say, let's ask ourselves these questions. 
             Has this...
    
    _Roz pounds on the glass and slashes a finger across her throat.
    He waves her off and continues._
    
    **Frasier:**...harmless delusion, most likely brought on by overwork and 
             sleep deprivation, adversely affected his voting record in 
             any way?  I ask you, and I say no.  What great leader doesn't 
             have his quirks?  Ronald Reagan saw an astrologist.  General 
             Patton believed in reincarnation.  Even J. Edgar Hoover let 
             his slip show once in a while! 
    
    [_N.B. To be fair, if Ronald Reagan ever saw an astrologist, 
    it's because Nancy asked him to. -- Mike Lee_]
    
    _Roz gives up and begins to pluck her eyebrows again._
    
    **Frasier:** People, we're talking about a great leader here!  We shouldn't 
             concern ourselves with these minor eccentricities. What's 
             important - what really counts - is what's in here... I'm 
             pointing at my chest now. 
    
    _Roz rolls her eyes and buries her face in her hands as the scene 
    fades out.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **ONE PERSON SPEAKING OUT _CAN_ MAKE A DIFFERENCE**
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's apartment.
    It's the evening of the election.  Daphne and Martin are watching 
    the results.  Frasier is sitting near the balcony, defeated._
    
    **Announcer:** The results from the last precinct are in.  Holden Thorpe 
               has been elected to Congress, garnering a whopping ninety-
               two percent of the vote. 
    
    _Martin laughs and claps._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, at least Mr. Patterson got eight percent.
     **Martin:** Yeah, well, they must have been counting absentee votes from 
             the planet Krypton!
    
    _He laughs, Frasier looks miserable._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, come on now, Dr. Crane.  It wasn't all your fault.  I'm 
             sure having those Guatemalans in his home would have cost 
             him some votes anyway. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Those Guatemalans were exchange students!  Phil was giving 
             them free room and board as a goodwill gesture between 
             countries.
     **Martin:** Well, I'd like to stay here and gloat, but I gotta get 
             changed to go to the big celebration down at Thorpe 
             headquarters.  Hey, you're welcome to tag along if you'd 
             like.  You're quite a hero down there! 
    
    _He exits, laughing._
    
    **Frasier:** No, thank you. [_he hits himself on the forehead_] Stupid, 
             stupid, stupid! [_then_] When will I learn it 
             hurts when I do that? 
             
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier gets up and opens the door to Phil._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Phil.  Come on in.
       **Phil:** Hi Frasier.  Thank you.  I just came by to return this good-
             luck tie you loaned me. [_hands him the tie_]
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, I saw you wearing it on television when you made 
             your concession speech.
       **Phil:** It was a little embarrassing having to do it before lunch. 
             But it gave me some time to run some errands and pick up my 
             dry cleaning. 
    **Frasier:** Phil, I am so sorry about the misunderstanding... 
       **Phil:** Oh, it's okay.  I know you didn't do it on purpose.  You 
             thought you were defending me. 
    **Frasier:** The people of Seattle deserve something better than Holden 
             Thorpe.
       **Phil:** That's politics.  And it's just one election.  I'll be back.
    **Frasier:** You really think you can?
       **Phil:** Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I like to believe anything's 
             possible. [_he starts to leave_]
    **Frasier:** Phil?  I've gotta ask you... do you really believe it 
             happened?
       **Phil:** I honestly wish I could say it didn't, but it did.  I guess 
             you'll never believe it unless it happens to you.
    **Frasier:** So, what's next for you? 
       **Phil:** Maybe I'll run in California.  A thing like this could 
             actually help me there. 
    
    _Phil leaves.  Frasier shuts the door and walks over to where he laid 
    the tie.  He picks it up for a moment and appears thoughtful. He then
    puts the tie down and walks up to the balcony door to look out._
    
    **Frasier:** Anything's possible... 
    _Suddenly, a bright light fills the sky.  Frasier frantically looks out 
    to see what it could be.  He opens the door and looks up into the sky._
    **Frasier:** Oh, very funny, Chopper Dave! 
    
    _He slams the door in disgust._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Roz is sitting at a table in the Cafe Nervosa.  She begins to pluck 
    her eyebrows.  She plucks one and blows the eyebrow off the tweezers. 
    She continues to do this until the little boy with the candy comes up 
    to her.  She blows one of her eyebrows at him to make him go away.
