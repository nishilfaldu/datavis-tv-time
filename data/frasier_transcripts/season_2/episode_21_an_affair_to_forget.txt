    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier is doing his show._
    
     **Frasier:** You're on KACL with Dr. Frasier Crane.  We have time for 
              one more call. [_pushes button_] Hello, Gretchen.  I'm
              listening.
    **Gretchen:**[_v.o.; German accent_] Well, you see, Dr. Crane, my husband 
              is a fencing instructor, and lately he spends all his time 
              with his wealthy new student.  He's with her day and night, 
              and I'm afraid there's some... _bumsen_ going on.
     **Frasier:** Well, is this just a suspicion or do you have any evidence?
    **Gretchen:** No, it's just a feeling.
     **Frasier:** Well, unfortunately, in these matters there's no simple way
              to know for sure.
         **Roz:** Yes, there is.
     **Frasier:** Well, Gretchen, you're in luck.  It just so happens that we 
              have in our studio today one of the world's five leading 
              _bumsen_ experts.
         **Roz:** If you want to know if a man is cheating, you offer him two 
              choices for dinner: one that's rich and fattening, and one 
              that's light and sensible.  If he picks the one that's 
              calorie-packed, he doesn't mind turning into a bloated pig, 
              which means he's happily married and you're in the clear.
     **Frasier:** You know, Roz, when I hear advice like that, it makes me 
              wish there was a law against two or more women gathering 
              at a water cooler.  Now, Gretchen--
    **Gretchen:** Does it really work, Roz?
         **Roz:** Oh, trust me.  If he chooses the diet plate, it means he's 
              staying in shape for his main squeeze, and you should get 
              yourself a lawyer who can sue the sweat off a racehorse.
    **Gretchen:** I'm going to do it.  Thank you for your help, Roz!  Oh, and 
              you, too, Dr. Crane. [_hangs up_]
     **Frasier:** Don't mention it.  Well, "Dr. Crane and Friends" will be 
              back tomorrow.  Thanks for listening, Seattle.
    
    _He goes off the air.  Roz comes into his booth._
    
        **Roz:** I know, you hate it when I butt into your show.
    **Frasier:** And yet...
        **Roz:** You're gonna forgive me when you find out the wonderful thing 
             I'm doing for you.  See, there's this great woman who lives in 
             my building.  She's beautiful, and funny--
    **Frasier:** Just stop right there, Roz.  I do not go out on blind dates.  
             They're demeaning and a hideous waste of time.  No, thank you, 
             no.
        **Roz:** It's not for you, it's for your father.
    **Frasier:** Oh!  What time should he pick her up?
        **Roz:** Wait a minute.  Blind dates are O.K. for your father, but 
             not for you?
    **Frasier:** Yes!  That also goes for games with balls, domestic beer, 
             and giant trucks that roll over smaller ones.
    
    _Frasier leaves.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    Martin and Niles are sitting at the dinner table with a large wooden 
    model ship kit.  Martin keeps trying to pick up pieces, but Niles 
    bats his hand away as he reads the instructions._
    
      **Niles:**[_reading_] "So you want to build a three-masted schooner.  
             Step One: before assembly, take inventory of all parts."
     **Martin:** We don't need to read all these instructions.
      **Niles:** Yes, we do.  It says right here in boldface, "Read all 
             instructions."
     **Martin:** Just pass me the right side of the hull, will ya?
      **Niles:** You'll get your hands on that piece at step sixteen and not a 
             moment sooner.
     **Martin:** Can we get started here?
      **Niles:** Oh, all right, Dad. [_reading_] "So you want to build a three-
             masted schooner."
    _Martin rolls his eyes.  Eddie picks up one of the masts in his teeth._
      **Niles:**[_grabs it away_] Give me that!  You'll put your eye out.
    
    _Daphne comes in with a potted plant._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, look at that!  What a beautiful ship.  I bet you'll have 
             fun building that.
     **Martin:** Not as much fun as we're having reading about it.
     **Daphne:** Did I ever mention one of my ancestors was a mutineer on the 
             _H.M.S. Bounty_?
     **Martin:** No kidding.
     **Daphne:** Yeah well, from what we could gather, he made it safely to 
             Pitcairn Island, where he was quite fruitful and multiplied.  
             You know, for all I know there's some girl who looks exactly 
             like me running around the South Seas, frolicking in the surf, 
             all brown-skinned and bare-breasted-
    _Niles snaps the mast in two, sending the pieces flying over the table.  
    Martin and Daphne look at him._
    
      **Niles:** So you want to build a _two_ -masted schooner.
     **Daphne:** Schooner?  I thought it was a frigate.
      **Niles:** No, no, a frigate has a fore-and-aft mainsail.
     **Daphne:** No, no, that's a brigantine.
      **Niles:** Oh, you're right.  Well, then what's a frigate?
     **Martin:** That's when you just don't give a damn anymore.
    _Martin goes to the kitchen for a beer.  Frasier comes in the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, all. [_everyone ad-libs hellos_] Niles, are you going to 
             be spending the evening with us?
      **Niles:** Yes.  As much as my Maris misses me, she feels family comes 
             first.  When she saw this model, she felt it was the perfect 
             project for me to share with Dad.
    **Frasier:** She wanted you out of the house, huh?
      **Niles:** Like a musty smell.
    
    _Martin comes back with a beer._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, I have a proposal for you.  Seems there's a woman 
             in Roz's building who would like to go out with you.  Roz 
             says that she's got a wonderful personality.
     **Martin:** Oh.  I guess that means I'm the pretty one.
    **Frasier:** Just hear me out.  She likes sports, she likes beer...
     **Martin:** Yeah, so does Duke.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but Duke won't kiss you good night at the end of the 
             evening.
     **Martin:** He will if he's had a few.  Look, tell Roz thanks, but no 
             thanks.
     **Daphne:** Well, I think you're making a mistake.  Trying new things is 
             what keeps us all young and vibrant.
      **Niles:** You know, you're right, Daphne.  For weeks, all Maris did 
             for excitement was float in her sensory deprivation tank.  
             But now, she's taken up fencing, and I've never seen her 
             more vital. [_Frasier's ears prick up at this._] She stays up 
             late into the evening, working with her instructor.
    **Frasier:** Maris has a fencing instructor?
      **Niles:** Yes.  Gunnar was the Bavarian champion three years running.
    **Frasier:** He's Bavarian?
      **Niles:** You're full of questions I've already given answers to.
    **Frasier:** Am I?
      **Niles:** He doesn't speak a word of English, so Maris gets to brush 
             up on her German while she parries and thrusts.
    **Frasier:** Maris is learning German, huh?  [_aside to Frasier_] Just when 
             you thought she couldn't get any cuddlier.
      **Niles:** Dad, did you take the spanking aft?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I pre-glued it for you.
    _Niles holds up his hand.  There's a piece of the model stuck to it._
    
      **Niles:** Good job.
     **Daphne:** Oh, not to worry.  This sort of thing used to happen to my 
             brothers all the time.  I can get that off with some nail-
             polish remover.  Come with me.
    
    _She leads him to the powder room._
    
      **Niles:** So your brothers built a lot of models?
     **Daphne:** No, actually, I suspect they just sniffed a lot of glue.
      **Niles:** You know that can cause brain damage.
     **Daphne:** Well, then, that confirms it.
    
    _They go into the powder room and close the door._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad!  Dad!  I have to talk to you about Niles.  I got a call 
             on the show today from a German woman whose husband is a 
             fencing instructor who she suspects is having an affair with 
             his wealthy new client.
     **Martin:** And?
    **Frasier:** Don't you find that the least bit incriminating?
     **Martin:** No, I find it a coincidence.  Seattle's a big city, I'm sure 
             there's a bunch of German fencing instructors, each one with 
             dozens of students.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but are they wealthy students?
     **Martin:** No, they're inner-city kids trying to work their way out of 
             the ghetto with nothing but a foil and a dream.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, in the midst of that slag heap of sarcasm, 
             I suppose there may be a kernel of truth.  I guess I could 
             just be letting my imagination run away with me.
     **Martin:** Ah, just trust me, forget it.  Come on, help me put this 
             model together.
    **Frasier:** God, I remember how Niles used to love these models.  Oh God, 
             remember that Christmas Mom got him the "Visible Man and 
             Woman?"  He had to glue all of the internal organs in the 
             right place.
     **Martin:** All I remember is you two fighting over it.
    
    _Daphne comes out of the powder room._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, Niles was getting on my nerves, so I had to go in 
             and steal his ovaries.
     **Daphne:** Now there's a conversation I'm glad I missed the beginning 
             of!
    _FADE TO:_
    **BAVARIANS AT THE GATE**
    
    _Scene Three -- KACL
    Roz is setting up Frasier's booth.  Frasier comes in._
    
    **Frasier:** Sorry I'm late, Roz.
        **Roz:** Oh, hey, Frasier.  Did you get a chance to ask your dad 
             about the date?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  He's not interested.
        **Roz:** Oh, darn it.  I already got her hopes up.  I don't suppose 
             you'd consider going out with her.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.  I've had my quota of pity-dates.
        **Roz:** Yes, but this time you wouldn't be the one being pitied.
    
    _He gives her a "very funny" look.  She goes into her booth._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, listen, we have a great call to start the show off 
             with.  Get this: the guy on line three just found out that 
             his girlfriend is his long-lost sister.
    **Frasier:** Wow!
        **Roz:** Oh yeah, and that German woman called back about her 
             husband's affair.
    **Frasier:** Gretchen!
        **Roz:** Yeah.
    
    _She closes the door to her booth._
    
    **Frasier:**[_through intercom_] I want her first!
        **Roz:** Are you kidding?  What am I supposed to say to the guy who's 
             dating his sister?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just tell him to hang on and relax, we've all been there!
    
    _Roz, somewhat bewildered, cues him._
    
     **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane on KACL.  Let's get 
              right to the phones.  Roz?
         **Roz:** We have Gretchen calling back about her husband's affair.  
              She thinks she has more evidence.
     **Frasier:** Hello, Gretchen.  I'm listening.
    **Gretchen:**[_v.o.; crying_] Oh, Dr. Crane!  I took Roz's advice and gave 
              my husband two choices for dinner, and he picked the diet 
              plate!
     **Frasier:** But that is no proof that he's having an affair!
    **Gretchen:** But Gunnar has a healthy appetite!
     **Frasier:** No, no, the proof is-is phone bills, uh, credit card 
              receipts... Gunnar?
    **Gretchen:** I also found a love letter he wrote to her.
     **Frasier:** And how long were you going to keep that a secret, Gretchen?  
              Come on, work with me here!  What does it say?
    **Gretchen:** "_Mein kleine leberknodel_..."
     **Frasier:** I-I'm sorry, I don't speak German.
    
    [_N.B. It is unusual for a confirmed Freudian such as Frasier to not
    have read Freud in the original German.  In fact, later episodes take
    it for granted that Frasier does in fact speak German._]
    
    **Gretchen:** It means, "my little liver dumpling."  That used to be his 
              pet name for me.
     **Frasier:** Well, maybe he's writing to you.
    **Gretchen:** It can't be me.  He says he loves her beautiful _little_ body, 
              as thin as his sword, and her skin as white as bratwurst, 
              and that she's his _NichteinmenschlichFrau_.
     **Frasier:** What is that?
    **Gretchen:** I don't know if there's a word in English.  The closest 
              translation is, "not quite human woman."
    
    _Frasier covers the microphone, a look of horror on his face._
    
     **Frasier:** Oh dear God, it is her!
    **Gretchen:** What should I do?
     **Frasier:** I don't know!  I-I need time to think!  Let's go to 
              commercial!
    
    _He goes to commercial.  Roz plugs a cart in.
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene Four -- KACL
    Roz cues Frasier that the commercial is over._
    
     **Frasier:** Hello, we're back.  Gretchen, I have considered your problem, 
              and I believe that what you must do is confront your husband, 
              and insist that he end this affair.
    **Gretchen:** But what if he won't?
     **Frasier:** But he has to!  Look, innocent people are being hurt!  Remind 
              him of how much he means to you, of all your years together.  
              Are there children?
    **Gretchen:** No.
     **Frasier:** Damn!  Still, still, it must be a clean break, he must never, 
              ever see this woman again, not even accidentally!
    **Gretchen:** We never had these problems back home.
     **Frasier:** Well, maybe that's where you should return, to the loving 
              bosom of Bavaria.
    **Gretchen:** How did you know we were from Bavaria?
     **Frasier:** Well... you see, I'm a master of dialects.  I noticed there 
              was a glottal quality to the occlusion of your diphthongs.
    **Gretchen:** But I'm originally from Austria.
     **Frasier:** Look, do you want to split hairs, or do you want your husband 
              back?  Uh, Gretchen, I'm afraid it's time for another 
              commercial.
         **Roz:** Another commercial?
     **Frasier:** Yes, Roz, another commercial!
    _He goes off the air.  Roz plugs in another cart and comes into 
    his booth._
    
        **Roz:** What is going on?
    **Frasier:** What makes you think there's something going on?
        **Roz:** Well, when the person giving advice sounds crazier than the 
             person calling in, I think there's something going on.
    **Frasier:** Nothing's going on.
        **Roz:** Wait a minute.  You know who the liver dumpling is, don't you?
    **Frasier:** All right, yes!  But it's nobody you know.  Her husband's a 
             good friend of mine.  Oh, how can I tell him, he'll be 
             crushed.
        **Roz:** Well, you don't tell the person being cheated _on_ , you confront 
             the person doing the _cheating_.  Didn't they teach you anything 
             at Harvard?
    **Frasier:** I-I can't do that!
        **Roz:** It's easy, Frasier.  You just tell her you know she's been 
             mattress-surfing with some other guy, and if she doesn't 
             knock it off, you'll tell her husband.
    **Frasier:** It's-it's not that easy, you don't know this woman!  She 
             doesn't deal with confrontation very well.  I once questioned 
             the political correctness of her serving veal.  
             An hour later, we found her locked in the garage with the 
             engine running on her golf cart!
        **Roz:** Whoa, it's Maris.
    _FADE TO:_
    **IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, 
    IT'S A SENSORY 
    DEPRIVATION TANK**
    
    _Scene Five -- Niles's Bathroom
    Marta (Niles's 78-year-old Guatemalan maid) leads Frasier into the 
    bathroom in Niles's mansion.  The room is dominated by a huge 
    rectangular steel tank with a hatch on the side._
    
      **Marta:**_Missy Crane esta en la caja_.
    **Frasier:** "Mrs. Crane is in the box."
      **Marta:**_En la caja_.
    
    _Marta leaves._
    
    **Frasier:** Maris?  This is Frasier.  I am tired of waiting for you to 
             come out of this ridiculous deprivation tank.  Now, listen.  
             We've got to talk, we've got to talk about Niles. 
    
    _Silence._
    
    **Frasier:** Will you come out of there!  Look, Maris... I know that you're 
             having an affair.  But I care for you both, and I want to help 
             you do what's best for your marriage. 
    
    _Silence._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, will you stop this!  Just come out of this box!  All right, 
             all right!  I'm going to open this door!  I'm going to count to 
             three and I don't care if you're naked! [_reconsiders_] I'm going 
             to count to ten!  Oh, the hell with this!  All right!
    _Frasier yanks the hatch open -- and gasps.  Sitting in the tank is 
    Niles -- naked, dripping wet, and speechless with horror.  Marta 
    comes back with fresh towels._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles... I'm so sorry.  Marta, you said Mrs. Crane was in 
             the box!
      **Marta:**[_looking_] _Si, Missy Crane_.
    **Frasier:** No, that's MISTER Crane!
      **Niles:** Marta has trouble with her pronouns.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's evening.  Frasier and Martin are pacing the apartment._
    
     **Martin:** I'm worried about him.  He's always been such a sensitive kid.
    **Frasier:** You're right, Dad, and you know what?  Maybe it's wise for us
             not to let on how worried we are.  It'll only add to his 
             anxiety.
     **Martin:** Yeah, you're right.  If we coddle him, he'll think this is 
             the end of the world.
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier and Martin exchange a look, then open the 
    door to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:**[_cheerful_] Hello, Niles!
     **Martin:**[_cheerful_] Hi, son!
    _Niles breaks down and holds out his arms.  Immediately, Frasier and 
    Martin are hugging him, patting him on the back, saying "It's OK," 
    "It's not the end of the world," "Everything's gonna be all right," 
    and so on.
    
    They steer him over to the couch.  Eddie jumps up into his lap and 
    starts licking his face._
    
     **Martin:** Frasier, pour him a glass of brandy.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, yes.  Oh God, you know, I'm all out of brandy.  
             I have a marvelous sherry here, a couple of fine ports... 
             oh, and this lovely new bottle of twelve-year-old unblended 
             scotch.  It's a little bit peaty--
     **Martin:** Just pour him a drink! [_to Niles_] What happened, son?
      **Niles:** Oh, nothing.
    **Frasier:** Nothing?  Well, when I left, you were about to storm up to 
             Maris's bedroom and have it out with her.
      **Niles:** I know.  And with every step I thought of another question to 
             fire at her, but when I reached her door, I froze.  I turned 
             on my heel, walked out of the house, got in the car and just 
             started driving.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad you ended up here. [_hands him a glass of Scotch 
             with a lemon wedge_]
      **Niles:** Actually, I ended up at the Oregon border check.  I had fruit 
             in the car, so I had to turn back.  What am I going to do?  
             She's my whole life.
    **Frasier:** You know, Niles, Maris may have temporarily succumbed to 
             Gunnar's Teutonic charms, but in the end I'm sure she'll 
             choose the man who's intelligent and sensitive.
      **Niles:** Oh, Frasier.  That's just something we used to tell ourselves 
             in chess club.  The truth is, women don't want men like us -- 
             men of intellect.  They want men of action -- men like Gunnar.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, you know this has nothing to do with Gunnar and 
             everything to do with you and Maris.  Do you remember the 
             advice you gave me when I was having my problems with Lilith?  
             You said that I should talk to her and find out why she did 
             what she did.
      **Niles:** It's one thing to give advice, it's another to take it.
     **Martin:** Hey, hey, Fras, didn't you and Lilith once write a bunch of 
             articles together about the keys to a successful marriage?
    **Frasier:** Yes, we did.
     **Martin:** Well, maybe it'd help your brother to read 'em right now.
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh, well, all right.  I've only got half of them, 
             though.  Lilith got the rest in the divorce settlement.
    
    _Frasier runs off to his room._
    
     **Martin:** Now, listen, now that we've gotten rid of the foghorn, here's 
             the way you're gonna handle this.  Now, you remember something 
             like this happened between your mother and I, right?
      **Niles:** Right.
     **Martin:** Right.  Well, the way I handled it was I took it up with the 
             other man.  I told him if it ever happened again, he'd be the 
             other woman!  Now there was a lot more that we had to do to 
             keep our marriage together, but at least that let your mother 
             know how much I cared for her.
      **Niles:** What would you have me do?  Grab Gunnar by the scruff of the 
             neck and escort him out of my house?
     **Martin:** Well, why not?
      **Niles:** Well, I've been fantasizing about it!  It's just not me, 
             though... although, maybe it should be me!  No, no, I've got 
             to speak to Maris eventually... although, if I do it your way, 
             I'm going at it from a position of strength.  I'm gonna do it, 
             Dad!  Maris has fencing practice tonight, but it's Gunnar 
             who's going to be taught a lesson!
     **Martin:** That's my boy!  You're sure you're up to it?
      **Niles:** Yes, I am! [_he guns down the rest of his drink_] I'm pumped, 
             I'm psyched, and I'm fairly certain I just swallowed an 
             entire twist of lemon!
    _Niles clears his throat and leaves.  Frasier comes back with a sheaf of 
    papers._
    
    **Frasier:** Did I just hear Niles leave?
     **Martin:** Yeah, he went to straighten out that Gunnar guy!
    **Frasier:** My God, Dad, how could you let him go? [_grabs his coat_] What 
             if this Gunnar guy doesn't want to get straightened out?  
             What if he wants to fight?
     **Martin:** Well, that's all right, it's still better this way!  At least 
             he's found his manhood.
    
    _Daphne comes out of the hallway._
    
     **Martin:** I tell ya, I'd be happy if Niles traded in a couple of teeth 
             for his _cojones_!
    
    _Frasier leaves._
    
     **Daphne:** I've got to stop walking in on the middle of conversations!
    _FADE TO:_
    **GET OUT YOUR DICTIONARIES**
    
    _Scene Seven -- Niles's Mansion
    In the living room of Niles's house, Gunnar -- a tall, thin-faced German -- 
    is on the couch, getting his fencing gear ready for Maris.  Niles comes 
    down the stairs, followed by Frasier and Marta._
    
      **Niles:** There you are! [_Gunnar looks up_] Yes, I'm talking to you, 
             strudel boy!  No one seduces my wife and gets away with it!  
             You probably thought because of my refined bearing and 
             swimmer's build that I wouldn't put up a fight for the woman 
             I love.  But you're dead wrong, because real men have a thing 
             called "honor!" [_Gunnar stands up; he's a full head taller 
             than Niles_] Yow!  You wouldn't know about that, would you?
    **Frasier:** Niles...
      **Niles:** You wouldn't know how decent people behave.
    **Frasier:** Niles...
      **Niles:** You wouldn't know the meaning of the word "rectitude!"
    **Frasier:** Niles, he wouldn't know the meaning of the word "dog," "cat," 
             or "pencil!"  He doesn't speak English, remember?!
     **Gunnar:**[_to Marta_] _Wieso ist er so bose?_
      **Marta:**_Ich weiss nicht._
      **Niles:** Marta!  You speak German?
      **Marta:**_Que?_
    **Frasier:** Uh, _habla alleman?_
      **Marta:**_Si!  Yo trabajo para una familia allemana que llego a 
             Guatemala despues a la Guerra._
    **Frasier:** Apparently she worked for a German family that turned up in 
             Guatemala... [_deep voice_] just after the war.
    _Marta frowns, while Frasier gives her a very Jack Benny look._
      **Niles:** Well, well, good, good!  She can translate for me!  Tell her 
             to tell him--
    **Frasier:** Niles, Niles, just wait!
      **Niles:** What?
    **Frasier:** Look at him!  God, if he knew you were calling him "strudel 
             boy," he'd be wiping his feet on your face!
      **Niles:** Hang that, Frasier!  If there're going to be scuffs, they'll 
             be scuffs of honor. [_to Gunnar_] How dare you steal my wife! 
             [_to Frasier_] Translate!
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right. [_to Marta_] _Senor Crane quiere que preguntas a 
             Gunnar, uh, "Como se atrevez a robar mis zapatos!"_
      **Marta:**[_to Gunnar_] _Was fallt Dir ein meine Schuhe zu stehlen?_
    
    _Finally understanding, Gunnar draws his sword on Niles._
    
     **Gunnar:**_Schweinehund!_
    
    _Frasier and Marta jump back in alarm._
    
      **Niles:** All right, fine, you want to challenge me? [_throws off his 
             jacket and grabs the other sword_] _En garde!_
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, Niles, that's just what we need, a fourth language! 
             Niles, you can't possibly fight this man!
      **Niles:** Are you forgetting?  I've been fencing since prep school!
    **Frasier:** Yes, oh, so what?  The man was obviously born with a sword in 
             his hand!  He probably performed his own Caesarean!
    
    _Gunnar attacks.  Niles scrambles to defend himself._
    
      **Niles:** Oh my God, he's gonna kill me.
    
    _Gunnar attacks again, driving Niles back to the fireplace._
    
      **Niles:**[_pointing_] _Farvegnugen!_
     **Gunnar:**[_looking_] _Farvegnugen?_
    _Niles breaks away and dashes across the room, tipping over the couch 
    as he goes.  Gunnar chases him, and they fight near the stairs.  
    Gunnar makes a sudden slash, shattering a Ming vase._
    
     **Gunnar:**[_apologizing_]
      **Niles:** Oh, very nice, very nice, thank you!
    _Realizing what's going on, they start to fight again.  They lock their 
    swords together, and Gunnar pushes Niles upstairs, out of sight.
    
    A moment later, Niles runs downstairs and hides behind the stairwell
    pillar.  When Gunnar comes down looking for him, Niles ambushes him.
    
    Niles fends off Gunnar's attacks and jumps up onto the piano.  Laughing 
    with sheer adrenaline, he shakes his hips and gives Gunnar a "Take Your 
    Best Shot!" grin.
    
    They fight some more.  Niles slashes at Gunnar's head, but he ducks.  
    Gunnar slashes at Niles's ankle, but he hops over it.  Niles grins 
    and swashes his sword back and forth.  Gunnar swashes his own sword.  
    Niles swashes his sword again, but loses his grip and drops it on the 
    floor.  
    
    As Gunnar presses forward, Niles turns, jumps, and swings across the 
    room on the chandelier like a pirate in a movie -- only the roof plaster 
    cracks, and Niles falls sprawling onto the floor._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Niles!  Niles, my God, are you all right?
    _Before Niles can get up, Gunnar presses the tip of his sword into the 
    soft flesh of his neck._
    
     **Gunnar:**_Entschuldige Dich sofort!  Ich habe nicht Deine Schuhe 
             gestohlen!_
      **Niles:**[_meekly, to Frasier_] Is he giving up?
      **Marta:**_Piedme perdon!  Yo no te robo sus zapatos!_
    **Frasier:** He says he wants you to apologize.  He didn't steal... 
             your shoes.
      **Niles:** My shoes?!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm sorry.  Apparently I mistranslated. [_to Marta_] Look, 
             he didn't mean, uh... not shoes, wife!  _No zapatos, esposa!_
      **Marta:**[_to Gunnar_] _Nicht Schuhe, Frau!_
     **Gunnar:**_Frau?_
    _Mumbling in German, Gunnar takes his sword away and sinks into a chair._
     **Gunnar:**_Maris ist unwiderstehlich._
      **Marta:**[_to Frasier_] _No me puede contralar.  Maris est irresistible._
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles_] He couldn't help himself, Maris is irresistible. 
             [_to Marta, in Spanish_] _Irresistible?_
      **Marta:**[_to Gunnar_] _Unwiderstehlich?_
     **Gunnar:**_Ja._
      **Marta:**_Si._
    **Frasier:** O-kayy.
     **Gunnar:**_Aber sie hat mich abgewiesen._
      **Marta:**_Pero me rechazo._
    **Frasier:** Oh, but she refused him.
      **Niles:** Really?
    **Frasier:**_Verdad?_
      **Marta:**_Wirklich?_
    _Gunnar throws up his hand.  Marta throws up her hand to Frasier, 
    who throws up his hand to Niles, who also throws up his hand._
    
      **Niles:** Well, what did Maris say?
    **Frasier:**_Que decia?_
      **Marta:**_Was hat sie gesagt?_
     **Gunnar:**_"Ich liebe Niles."_
      **Marta:**_"Yo amo Niles."_
    **Frasier:** "I love Niles."
      **Niles:** She loves me! [_hugs Frasier_] Oh, she loves me!  [_hugs Marta_] 
             My marriage is whole!
    _He moves to hug Gunnar, but ends up just patting him on the shoulders._
      **Niles:** Give me five seconds, then tell him he's fired. [_running 
             upstairs_] Maris!
    _He exits._
    **Frasier:** Oh lord, if only I can do something to help Gunnar and 
             Gretchen.
     **Gunnar:**[_looking up_] Gretchen?
    **Frasier:**_Ja, ja,_ uh... [_to Marta_] Tell him that his wife loves him 
             very much.  Uh, I mean, _diga a Gunnar que su esposa le ama 
             mucho._
      **Marta:**_Diem Frau_ [_points at Frasier_] _liebt ihn sehr._
    _Frasier smiles beatifically.  Gunnar draws his sword, enraged._
     **Gunnar:**_SCHWEINEHUND!_
    **Frasier:** No, no, not me!  You, you!  Marta, damn your pronoun problems!
    _He scrambles to the other side of the room.  Then, getting into the 
    spirit, he takes a sword down from the mantle and roars a challenge 
    at Gunnar._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, then, you hapless wretch!
    
    _They start to fence.
    
    END OF ACT TWO_
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles enters the bathroom wearing a bathrobe and carrying a tray.  
    On the tray are an ice bucket with a bottle of champagne, and a red 
    rose.
    
    He knocks on the hatch.  It opens.  He pours a glass of champagne and 
    holds it into the hatchway.  An unseen hand takes it.  He puts the rose 
    in his mouth, but pricks himself on one of the thorns.  He hands Maris 
    the rose, then slides into the tank with his own glass of champagne, 
    pulling the hatch closed behind him.
