After some lacklustre episodes, this episode begins Keenan's tradition of farce that will continue to \"The Two Mrs. Cranes\" and \"The Ski Lodge.\" Very well acted, with some great lines (\"The Perils of Refinement,\" \"If I could pick any man for Daphne, he's the one I'd pick,\" etc.), the only slow parts were the beginning which could have had more of an impact.  Still, watch this episode for a gay old time! **Grade: B+** ",

Second, it was a landmark in and of itself, and won a special award from GLAAD (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), in recognition of the difficulty of introducing gay humor into a mainstream comedy show without conforming to stereotypes.  This is a challenge even for writers who are gay themselves, and Keenan succeeds brilliantly. The misunderstanding he sets up for the premise is perfectly credible, and Keenan hits several existing assumptions without relying on them to keep the plot going.  With this episode, \"Frasier\" (and Keenan) broke new ground and proved some important things, without which later shows like \"Will & Grace\" would not have been tried. **A-** [_This episode is virtually reproduced (but with Martin in the hot seat) in_ [[7.15]](/frasier/transcripts/season_7/episode_15/out_with_dad.html \"Out With Dad\") Out With Dad]   * * *  ## AWARDS & NOMINATIONS  ## Won  DIRECTORS GUILD OF AMERICA   ",
