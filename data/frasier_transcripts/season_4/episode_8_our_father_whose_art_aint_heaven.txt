    _Act One
    
    Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Eddie is asleep on Martin's chair.  Frasier, Niles and Martin enter 
    through the front door.  Niles goes to the phone to check his 
    messages._
    
     **Martin:** Look, we had an agreement.  We went to see a movie I wanted 
             to see, so I'm supposed to pay for the tickets.
    **Frasier:** Very well, Dad.  The next time we go to see a Jean-Claude 
             Van Damme movie, not only may you pay for the tickets, but 
             also for the wild horses it will take to drag me there!
     **Martin:** Well, I'm only mad because we had an agreement.  Now, a man's 
             supposed to honour his agreement, didn't you learn anything 
             from that movie?
    **Frasier:** Yes, only that bullets are useless against the man who can 
             kick really high!
     **Martin:** Now, look, I'm serious about this.  Once in a while I'd like 
             to pay.
    **Frasier:** Okay.
     **Martin:** Okay, so the next time we go anywhere, it's on me.  Have I 
             made my point?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety Mr. Van Damme displayed 
             when he jet-packed into the Vatican to subdue that nasty 
             Pope imposter!
     **Martin:** Like you saw that coming!
    
    _Martin exits to the kitchen.  Frasier pours two sherries._
    
      **Niles:** Well, Maris has finally deigned to call me back after I'd 
             left no fewer than twenty messages!
    **Frasier:** Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many times you give her 
             all the power.  You're much better off coming from a position 
             of strength! 
      **Niles:** Don't pour that sherry on your shirt, it will stain.
    **Frasier:**[_mystified_] What?!
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I thought this was the portion of the afternoon 
             where we gave each other patently obvious advice! [_pause_] 
             I had to call Maris!  You know that party I'm throwing for 
             my country club friends.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes.  The one I wasn't invited to but my Waterford punch 
             bowl was!
      **Niles:** Yes, well... Maris has chosen the exact same night to throw 
             a party of her own.
    **Frasier:** Well, couldn't you ask her to postpone?
      **Niles:** I tried.  She's already flown in a sculptor from Sweden to 
             capture her likeness in ice.
    **Frasier:** Ah, the perfect marriage of subject and medium!
      **Niles:** Well, you can see my problem.  We're going to be competing 
             now for which friends go to which party.
    **Frasier:** You know Niles, for a separated couple still hoping to 
             reconcile I'm afraid you're going down a path...
      **Niles:**[_interrupting_] You shouldn't wear that tie with that jacket.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I see.  Is that your clever way of telling me I'm 
             dispensing unwanted criticism?
      **Niles:** That too!
    _Daphne comes in with a large, full carrier bag._
     **Daphne:** Hello, boys.
       **Both:** Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:**[_to Niles_] Dr. Crane -- will you be joining us for dinner?
      **Niles:** What a nice invitation.  I'd love to.
     **Daphne:** Well then, you're in for a treat.  I've decided to make 
             Grammy Moon's famous "Sheep's Head Stew." [_notes the 
             concerned faces in front of her_] Oh, don't worry.  The name's 
             a bit misleading.  It's actually more of a soup!
     **Martin:** You actually use a real sheep's head?
     **Daphne:** Well, you have to. [_holds up carrier bag_] It's right in here.
    **Frasier:**[_leaping up suddenly_] Oh my God -- I just remembered.  We have 
             reservations at Le Cigare Volante tonight!
      **Niles:** Oh my God, you're right.
     **Martin:**[_also leaping up out of his chair_] Oh Jeez, I nearly forgot.
     **Daphne:** You're going too, Mr. Crane?
     **Martin:** Well, I promised the boys. [_getting into his jacket_] I don't 
             suppose there's any way you guys would let me out of this, 
             is there? [_there is general protestations all round which 
             Martin quite happily gives in to_] Well, I tried!
     **Daphne:** Well, have fun.  I'm off to stick me head in the oven.
    _The boys laugh as they all head out of the apartment as quickly as 
    possible.  As soon as they are gone Daphne picks up the phone._
     **Daphne:** Hello, Marshall?  I got rid of them.  You bring some wine and 
             I'll throw the steaks on.
    
    [_N.B. Marshall is the name of Jane Leeves's real-life husband._]
    _FADE OUT_
    **SOMETIMES LE CIGARE IS JUST LE CIGARE**
    _Scene 2 -- Le Cigare Volante. 
    The boys turn up to be greeted by an extremely full restaurant.
    _
    **Frasier:** Oh dear Lord, it's rather busy.  Let's keep our fingers 
             crossed. [_looks over to the other side of the restaurant_] 
             Francois!
    _Francois, the maitre 'd, comes rushing over._
    **Francois:** Ah, Dr. Crane.  Bonsoir. [_kisses Frasier on both cheeks_]
     **Frasier:** Bonsoir.
    **Francois:** Dr. Crane.  Bonsoir. [_kisses Niles on both cheeks_]
       **Niles:** Bonsoir.
     **Frasier:**[_introducing_] And this is our father, Martin Crane.
    **Francois:**[_going to kiss Martin_] Ah, Monsieur Crane.
      **Martin:**[_grabbing Francois's hand and shaking it rapidly_] How you 
              doing?
    **Francois:** Enchante!
     **Frasier:** Francois, I'm afraid we are at your mercy tonight.  You see, 
              we have no reservations.
    **Francois:** Oh la la, Dr. Crane.  I will see what I can do.
     **Frasier:** Thank you, thank you.  Anything would be just fine, thank 
              you.  Come to think of it we haven't been here since Chef 
              Wakim had his pinky grafted back on.
    **Francois:** Oh.  Then this is your first time seeing our new artwork. 
              He's my own discovery.  His name is Cordoba!
    _Francois points out a number of paintings dotted round the room 
    which at best can be described as a hideous dirge of colour. 
    Somewhere in the nearest one is a matador, a bull and an awful lot 
    of blood and guts.  Frasier and Niles obviously feign approval._
     **Frasier:** Exquisite!
       **Niles:** Stunning!
     **Frasier:** My God, I don't think I've ever seen such fearless use of 
              colour.  You know, as usual your taste is as fine as your 
              cuisine. [_pointing at the reservations book_] Any luck?
    **Francois:** For you, yes.  For Dr. Dubain who brings his own wine, no! 
              [_scrubs out a name_] Follow me, please.
     **Frasier:** Merci bien!
    **Francois:**[_sitting the group_] Your table is ready.
      **Martin:** You guys go ahead.  I've got to make a little visit to Le 
              Can!
    **Francois:**[_handing out the menus_] Le menu!  I will be back with the 
              wine list.
    _Francois disappears leaving Niles and Frasier sitting at the table._
    **Frasier:** Wine list?  My God, he ought to bring us blindfolds.  I mean, 
             what is he thinking with this artwork?  It's appalling!
      **Niles:**[_jokingly_] Who is it who said that art in restaurants is on
             the same level with food in museums?
    **Frasier:** The little white lies one will tell for a good table.  Of 
             course I would compliment a black velvet Elvis right now if 
             Chef Wakim's lobster comfit were at stake!
      **Niles:**[_noticing the table across the restaurant_] Frasier, that's 
             Winchett Cook.  She's one of the guests Maris and I are 
             competing over for our parties.  I'm going to go woo her.
    **Frasier:** Oh really, Niles.  Why don't you just reschedule your party?
      **Niles:** Because I don't want to give Maris the satisfaction.  She's 
             pushed me around long enough.
    **Frasier:** All right.
      **Niles:** Metaphorically, of course.  In reality she can hardly push 
             at all.  Like that terrible afternoon last spring she spent 
             trapped in the revolving doors at Bergdorf's!
    _Niles ups and heads over to the other table.  Meanwhile Martin 
    rejoins Frasier at the table._
      **Martin:** I hope there's something on there you like 'cos dinner's on 
              me tonight.
     **Frasier:** What do you mean, Dad?
      **Martin:** We had an agreement.  Next time we went out it was my treat.
     **Frasier:** Yes Dad, but when I said that what I meant was...
      **Martin:** Hup!  We're not discussing it.
     **Frasier:** Yes, but Dad the trouble is here...
      **Martin:** Hup! You promised.
     **Frasier:** I just don't...
      **Martin:** Hup!
     **Frasier:**[_exasperated_] All right, all right, your treat.
      **Martin:**[_satisfied_] Thank you.  Now don't worry about it -- just 
              order whatever you want... [_Martin examines the menu and his 
              face turns to a look of abject horror.  Meanwhile Francois 
              has returned with the wine list_] Is this per person?
    **Francois:**[_handing Frasier the wine list_] The wine list.
     **Frasier:**[_realising the situation_] Thank you.  Thank you, Francois 
              but I don't believe we'll be having any wine tonight [_hands 
              back the wine list_]
    **Francois:** And I'm going out for a Big Mac after work!
     **Frasier:** No, I'm really being quite serious.  You see, my brother 
              and I are watching our caloric intake tonight -- we'll be 
              eating light.
    **Francois:** As you wish, Doctor.
    _Francois disappears again leaving Martin looking extremely unhappy._
     **Martin:**[_angrily_] I know what you're doing, you know.  I'm not stupid.
    **Frasier:** What are you talking about?
     **Martin:** You're eating light?  All the way over here you had the same 
             look on your face that Eddie gets when he hears a can 
             opener!
    **Frasier:** Look, Dad -- it's just that I'm not that comfortable ordering 
             an expensive meal when you're paying.
     **Martin:** Well, what's the big deal?  You take me to places like this 
             all the time.
    **Frasier:** I can afford it! [_notices the hurt look on Martin's face_] 
             I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that the way it sounded.  I know 
             how you feel.
     **Martin:** No, you don't.  You're always paying for me and I'm never 
             allowed to pay for you.  Well, it feels pretty lousy.  Well, 
             go ahead, Mr. Bigshot -- you pay!
    **Frasier:** Dad!
    _Niles returns from the other side of the restaurant._
      **Niles:** Well, the good news is Winchett has agreed to come to my 
             party.  The bad news is I've left my wallet at home so, 
             Frasier, I'm afraid this is on you.
    **Frasier:** Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad.
     **Martin:** No, you ruined it.  I'm not paying.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm not paying.
      **Niles:** Well, I can't pay!
    _On hearing this news Francois sidles up to the table._
    **Francois:** So that would be three Happy Meals to go?
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 3 -- Frasier's Apartment. 
    Daphne is alone in the living room on the phone.
    _
     **Daphne:** No, he never suspected a thing.  Yes, I had a great time too. 
             Oh go on, Marshall -- say it again. [_after a brief pause she 
             chuckles to herself_] Now say it how you said it last night 
             like Donald Duck. [_another brief pause but Daphne is now stony 
             faced_] Well, I guess it was the wine that made it funny. [_the 
             key is heard in the front door and Daphne rushes up_] Yes, 
             I'll see you tonight.  Bye.
    _True enough, the front door opens and Frasier and Niles come in._
       **Both:** Hello.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Will you be savouring us with any English delicacies 
             tonight?
     **Daphne:** Well as a matter of fact, yes.  The butcher had in some 
             lovely carved stomachs so I'm going to try my hand at 
             haggis.
    _Daphne heads off to the kitchen leaving Niles looking as though he 
    is about to vomit._
    **Frasier:** Even Hannibal Lecter couldn't keep that woman's cooking down!
    _Niles's cell phone rings and he answers._
      **Niles:** Hello?  Ah, Winchett -- so looking forward to seeing you at 
             the party. [_a pause_] Oh, how dreadful.  Oh, you poor thing. 
             No, no, of course I understand.  The important thing is that 
             you get better.  You are a dear for calling... [_hangs up 
             phone_] ...you lying, two-faced cow!
    **Frasier:** So she's not really sick?
      **Niles:** Oh, hardly.  Maris is luring away all my confirmed guests. 
             Suddenly there are accidents, deaths in the family.  A wave 
             of misfortune is sweeping through society's blue bloods at a 
             rate unprecedented since the French Revolution!
    _Martin comes through from the bedroom._
     **Martin:** Oh great, you're back.  Hey, listen.  About last night at 
             the restaurant -- I'm really sorry.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, no Dad.  It was my fault.  I should have been 
             more gracious.
     **Martin:** No, no, it was my fault.  I was the one who overreacted.  I 
             just really wanted to do something nice for you.  You know, 
             the older you get the harder it is to do stuff for your 
             kids.
    **Frasier:** I understand.  I tell you what.  Next three dinners are on 
             you.
     **Martin:**[_excited_] No, no, no.  I found something better than that.  
             I finally found something I know you're gonna like. [_heading 
             back through to the bedroom_] Now just a minute.  This 
             is going to be so great.
    **Frasier:** My God -- I haven't seen him this excited since he got that 
             four-in-one remote control!
    _Martin returns with possibly the worst present ever: that painting 
    from Le Cigar Volante complete with matador, bull, blood, guts, 
    spears sticking out of ribcages, etc., etc.  While Martin is thrilled 
    with himself it goes without saying that both Frasier and Niles are 
    horrified but try to put on a brave face._
     **Martin:** It's a Cordoba.
      **Niles:** Ole!
     **Martin:** Yeah, you guys were raving about these paintings last night 
             so I went down to the restaurant this morning to find out 
             where they got theirs and lucky me, the ones they had were 
             for sale.
    **Frasier:**[_trying to find the words_] Dad, this is awfully, awfully...
     **Martin:** Expensive!  Yeah, yeah but it's worth it.  You don't know 
             how good this makes me feel.  After I'm gone this will still 
             be here.
    _Frasier's face gets increasingly more concerned.  Meanwhile Daphne 
    returns from the kitchen._
     **Martin:** Hey Daph, come here.  Take a look at this.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm very impressed, Mr. Crane.  When did you have the 
             time to do that?
     **Martin:** Oh, sure.  Like I could paint something like this.  You know, 
             I was thinking, maybe, we could put it over the fireplace.
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes, the fireplace.  That's the first place I thought 
             of too!
    _End of Act One
    
    Act Two
    
    Scene 1 -- KACL. 
    Frasier is on the phone to a caller whilst Roz is in the booth 
    looking on.
    _
       **Greg:**[_v.o._] ...and lately I've had the chronic fluctuating mood 
             disturbances which would indicate psychothymic disorder.  
             I mean, the hypomanic symptoms are there and yet I'm 
             experiencing moments of aphasia and aproxia and I just want 
             to pull my teeth out, Dr. Crane.  What do you think?
    **Frasier:** Well, Greg, two possible diagnoses come to mind.  Either you 
             are seriously mentally ill and you should be institutionalized 
             immediately, or you are a first-year psychology student!
       **Greg:** Oh yeah, I'm at UW.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, it's not uncommon for students to feel that they're 
             manifesting symptoms that they are studying.  It'll pass.
       **Greg:** What do I do till it passes?
    **Frasier:** Well, just relax.  Though it might be a good idea to postpone 
             reading about male sexual disorder until after spring break. 
             [_Roz signals to wind up the show_] That's all the time we have 
             for today.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780.
    _Frasier signs off and Roz comes through to the studio._
        **Roz:** Good show.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Roz.  Say, Roz, if you're not busy after work would 
             you like, maybe, to get a drink or something?  Maybe see a 
             movie? You pick, I'll pay?
        **Roz:**[_smiling_] You can stay out as late as you want but eventually 
             you're going to have to go home and that painting will still 
             be there! [_Frasier looks upset at being rumbled_] You have to 
             tell him.
    **Frasier:** I can't, Roz.  You didn't see the look on his face when he 
             gave it to me.
        **Roz:** Frasier, have I ever told you about my ceramic hippo 
             collection?
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, many times.
        **Roz:** The hell I have!  Shut up and listen!  One Christmas my 
             Grandma sent me a ceramic hippo...
    **Frasier:**[_interrupting_] Roz, a hippo cannot possibly be as repellant 
             as a rabid matador killing an epileptic bull!
        **Roz:** Was the bull wearing a pork-pie hat and fishing off a dock?
    **Frasier:** Continue.
        **Roz:** I made the mistake of telling her how much I loved it.  
             Well, that just opened the floodgates.  I got ice-skating 
             hippos and hula-hooping hippos.  Thank God for that 
             earthquake.
    **Frasier:** Oh, you mean they broke?
        **Roz:** Well, I assume they did when they hit the bottom of the 
             garbage chute.  But I blamed it on the earthquake, and the 
             point is, you need to talk to your father now and be honest 
             with him or you're gonna be stuck with that thing until the 
             next natural disaster.
    **Frasier:** You're right, Roz.  Guess I'll just have to tell him this 
             afternoon. [_goes to leave the studio but turns back with a 
             thoughtful expression_] Oh, Roz - that crystal vase I gave 
             you three years ago for Christmas... er... you said that was 
             broken in the earthquake?
        **Roz:** Oh, no, no, that really was.  I was very disappointed.  As 
             disappointed as you were when Eddie chewed up that sweater 
             I gave you for Christmas!
    **Frasier:**[_exchanging a knowing look_] This year -- liquor?
        **Roz:** Deal!
    _FADE TO:_
    **OUR FATHER WHOSE ART AIN'T HEAVEN**
    _Scene 2 -- Frasier's Apartment. 
    Frasier walks in to find his Dad sitting in his chair.  The painting 
    still has pride of place above the fireplace.
    _
    **Frasier:** Hi, Dad.
     **Martin:** Hey, Fraz.
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, I was just down in the storage room putting 
             away some boxes and guess what I came across -- that smoking 
             jacket I gave you for Christmas last year?
     **Martin:** The shiny one?
    **Frasier:** Not shiny, Dad.  Silk!  I really messed up on that one, 
             didn't I?  Buying things for other people -- it's so hard 
             sometimes, isn't it?
     **Martin:** Yeah. [_points to a plate beside him_] Hey, you want some 
             pastrami?  There's more in the fridge.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, Dad.  I don't really care for pastrami.  Isn't 
             that funny?  You can love something so much and I would find 
             it distasteful? [_sneaks a glance at the painting_] People 
             have different tastes, you know?
     **Martin:** Yeah, well that's one way of looking at it.  Some people 
             like pastrami, like me.  Other people don't.  They're nuts!
    _There is a knock on the front door and Frasier answers.  It's Niles._
      **Niles:** Afternoon.
    **Frasier:** Afternoon, Niles.
     **Martin:** Hi, Niles.
      **Niles:** Dad.  Frasier, I'm here to pick up the punch bowl for my 
             party.  Although at this point a soup bowl might suffice. 
             [_he walks past the painting and shudders as he does so_] 
             Thanks to Maris I'm down to three confirmed guests.
    **Frasier:** Three?  Yesterday it was twelve, wasn't it?
      **Niles:** She's circulating a vicious rumour that I'm going to have a 
             karaoke machine!
    **Frasier:** You know, this vindictive behaviour of Maris's is completely 
             out of line.  You know, if you don't want to continue with 
             it you really should call her on the phone.  Confront her.
      **Niles:** You're absolutely right.  It's time I took the bull by the 
             horns. [_as he dials he realises what he's said and has 
             another withering glance over at the painting_] Sorry! [_he 
             gets through to Maris_] Maris.  Niles.  You may feel you've 
             triumphed, but all you've done is shown yourself to be petty 
             and uncivil.  Frankly, the only people lower than you are 
             the fickle paramecia that deserted my party to attend yours. 
             [_Frasier smiles encouraging him onwards_] Uh-huh.  Oh, I see. 
             Very well.  Yes.  I'll see you at eight -- should I bring 
             anything?
    _Frasier just looks down in contempt.  Niles also looks rather sorry 
    for himself as he hangs up._
    **Frasier:** Thank God for the starch in that shirt or there'd be nothing 
             holding you upright!
    _Frasier goes off to the kitchen to clean the punch bowl as Martin 
    emerges from his bedroom carrying what appears to be a wine rack but, 
    in line with the painting, it seems a bit tacky with leaves and 
    branches protruding from all areas._
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.  Here. [_hands him the wine rack_]
      **Niles:** Well, what's that?
     **Martin:** It's a wine rack.
      **Niles:**[_bewildered_] Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah.  I felt kind of bad about giving Frasier something and 
             nothing for you, so I saw it at PriceBusters.
    _By now Frasier has come out of the kitchen and has a smile on his 
    face as he watches the goings-on._
      **Niles:** Well, thank you for the thought, Dad but it doesn't really 
             fit in with the decor of my apartment.
     **Martin:**[_unperturbed_] Oh.  Oh, well OK.  No harm done.  I'll take it 
             back.  Anybody want a beer?
      **Niles:** No, thanks.
    **Frasier:** No thanks, Dad.
    _Martin disappears off to the kitchen.  Frasier ponders what just 
    happened and obviously realises how easy it can be if he just says 
    what he thinks._
      **Niles:** Frasier, I no longer require your punch bowl, but may I 
             borrow your blowdryer?
    **Frasier:** Of course.  Why?
      **Niles:** Sven just finished Maris's ice sculpture and she's convinced 
             she looks a bit "hippy."
    _Niles heads off to Frasier's bedroom.  Frasier decides to have it out 
    with Martin and goes through to the kitchen._
    **Frasier:** Dad?  Are you sure Niles didn't just hurt your feelings 
             there?
     **Martin:** No.  No.  I'm glad he told me.  I don't want to give him 
             something he doesn't like.
    **Frasier:** That's very wise.  You know, it's important that fathers and 
             sons can be honest with each other.  It shows respect.  You 
             know I've been thinking, Dad, about the painting.  You know, 
             art is such a personal thing?  What one person may like, 
             another may not?  It doesn't mean one of them is right and 
             the other is wrong.
     **Martin:** You're telling me you don't like the painting?
    **Frasier:** Well, it's not that I don't like it.  It's just that I don't 
             love it. It's not me.
     **Martin:** Not a problem -- you don't like it, I'll take it back.
    _Martin turns towards the fridge to get something.  Frasier is finally 
    content with himself._
    **Frasier:** Oh thank you, thank you, Dad.  That's such a relief.  You 
             know, I was up half the night worrying about it and I just... 
             [_notices Martin is quietly crying_] Dad, are you all right?  
             I didn't upset you, did I?  My God, Dad, are you crying?
     **Martin:**[_clearly crying with his back turned to Frasier_] No!
    **Frasier:** Yes, you are.  Yes, you are -- I just saw you wipe your eye.
     **Martin:**[_in tears_] No, I didn't.  Quit looking at me.
    **Frasier:** Dad! [_breaks into tears as well_] I made my father cry!
     **Martin:** Now don't you start.
    **Frasier:**[_sobbing_] I'm only crying because you're crying.
     **Martin:**[_sobbing_] I'm not crying.  I don't know what this is.  
             I didn't even cry when I got shot!
    **Frasier:**[_sobbing_] I didn't cry when you got shot either.
    _Martin turns and rushes away from Frasier back into the living room. 
    Frasier, still in tears, follows him.  This next part of the 
    conversation takes place amidst some serious sobbing, wailing 
    and downright howling._
     **Martin:** I'm getting rid of that damn painting right now.  I just 
             wish I knew why you told me you loved it so much?
    **Frasier:** I wasn't lying.
     **Martin:** You can't lie to me!
    **Frasier:** Dad.  Dad, please.  Please stop crying.  I want to keep it 
             now.
     **Martin:** No, it's no good.
    **Frasier:** No, no, it is good.  It's very good.  I love it.
    _At this point Niles returns from the bedroom.  Frasier immediately 
    makes for the coffee table and tries to hide his face.  Martin does 
    the same._
      **Niles:** Well, I found the... [_notices Martin crying_] ...the... er... 
             Dad, are you crying? [_Martin brushes him off towards Frasier_] 
             Frasier, what happ... [_sees Frasier sitting down sobbing 
             uncontrollably_] Oh my God, you're crying too. [_also becoming 
             emotional_] Why is everybody crying?  You know how I get when 
             other people cry.  Tell me what happened.
    **Frasier:**[_weeping_] I made our father cry.
     **Martin:**[_crying_] I'm not crying.
    **Frasier:** Well, I am.  I'm the most ungrateful son there is!
     **Martin:** I can never do anything for my sons!
      **Niles:**[_finally breaking down into a truly pathetic wail_] No one 
             wants to come to my party!
    _FADE TO:_
    **FAMILY TIES**
    _Scene 3 -- Frasier's Apartment. 
    It is obviously late in the night.  Martin is in the kitchen in his 
    dressing gown getting a drink.  Frasier, also in his dressing gown, 
    joins him.  Both seem to have recovered.
    _
    **Frasier:** Dad.
     **Martin:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Don't you think we oughta talk about what happened this 
             afternoon?
     **Martin:** Nothing happened this afternoon.
    **Frasier:** Look, Dad.  I know you're disappointed about the painting.
     **Martin:** That's not a problem.
    **Frasier:** Well, you said yourself that it wasn't as easy for you to 
             give me things as it was when I was a kid. 
     **Martin:** Yeah, well I wasn't very good at it then either.  Your Mother 
             always picked all your stuff out.
    **Frasier:** Still, you did put a roof over my head.  Sent me to school...
     **Martin:** All right.  You want to talk about this?  We'll talk about 
             it. [_takes a seat_] Do people ever come up to you after 
             they've met me and say, "How can that guy be your father?  
             He's nothing like you."
    **Frasier:** Well...
     **Martin:** 'Cause they've been saying that to me about you for the last 
             four years!  I just thought that... I don't know... I'd 
             finally given you something.  Something you liked.  
             Something we both liked.  That we had something in common or 
             something.  That's no big deal. [_gets up_] I'm going to bed.
    **Frasier:** Dad, Dad, just hang on a second, will you?  Do you remember 
             a time when I was six or seven years old?  You were getting 
             ready for work, you were getting dressed.  I was playing with 
             your badge and you sat me down and you said that it was not 
             a toy.  That it was a symbol of something very important.  
             Of integrity and honesty and helping people. [_Martin smiles 
             to himself as he reminisces_] Well, from then on, every time 
             I'd see you put on that badge I would think of that.
     **Martin:** I just said that so you'd stop playing with the damn thing. 
             You were getting it all sticky.
    **Frasier:** Be that as it may, I've tried to live up to your example and 
             help other people.  I've tried as a psychiatrist to conduct 
             myself with the same integrity that you showed as a police 
             officer.  And when I find myself in a quandary as to the 
             proper course of action, I think of you wearing that badge 
             and then I know what I have to do.  You gave me that!
     **Martin:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** Yeah, Dad.  Thanks.
     **Martin:** You know?  I think I may have something else to give you. 
             Something that I know you'll really like.  I'll be back in a 
             minute.
    _Martin gets up and disappears to his bedroom leaving Frasier alone 
    with his thoughts.  Frasier gets up and walks over to the painting.  
    He has a look at it in an obvious attempt to try and like it.  After 
    a moment's sizing-up he shudders and looks away in disgust.  Martin 
    returns carrying something._
     **Martin:** I've been holding onto this for quite a while now -- waiting 
             for the right time. [_hands over a box to Frasier_]
    **Frasier:**[_shocked_] My goodness, Dad.  I'm speechless. Your ba...
             [_opens box_] ...bow tie! [_Frasier is clearly none too 
             impressed having expected something else_]
     **Martin:** They gave it to your Grandfather when he retired from the 
             force.  When I graduated from the Academy he gave it to me, 
             and now I'm giving it to you, and someday you'll give it to 
             Frederick.
    **Frasier:**[_lost for words_] I don't know what to say.
     **Martin:** You're not going to start crying, are you?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no!  It's just a surprise, that's all.
     **Martin:**[_realising_] Hey, wait a minute.  You didn't think I was 
             going to give you my badge, did you?
    **Frasier:** Well... I... er...
     **Martin:** My badge?  That's a laugh.  You'd have to pry it out of my 
             cold, dead hands!
    **Frasier:** It's a date!
    _Martin heads back to bed.  Frasier throws the bow tie back in the box 
    in disgust.
    
    End of Act 2_
    **Credits:**
    
    Roz walks into her booth at KACL and sees a box sitting on her desk 
    waiting for her.  She eagerly unwraps it and takes a look inside 
    before pulling out a ceramic hippo with an anguished look on her 
    face.  And still it continues as she pulls out another one, and 
    another one, and another one -- each tackier than the previous.
