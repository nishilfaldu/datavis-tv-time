    _ACT ONE_
    **ON THE PLUS SIDE SHE DID LOSE TWO POUNDS**
    _Scene 1 - Int. Frasier's Studio at KACL
    Frasier is seated in his booth.  Roz stands beside him, sorting 
    through papers._
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, I managed to get some reservations at San Gennaro 
             tonight. [_standing_] I thought we'd go celebrate your birthday.
        **Roz:**[_looking up_] Oh, that is so sweet, but I have a date.  With 
             that waiter we met at lunch yesterday.
    **Frasier:**[_disbelieving_] You're going out with that guy?
        **Roz:** I didn't have enough for a tip.
    **Frasier:** Keep in mind the service wasn't that good. [_pause_] Well, the 
             reservation won't go to waste.  I can always take Niles.
        **Roz:** Niles?  Again?  You know, your entire social life consists 
             of going out with your brother. [_pause_] Don't you think 
             you're getting into kind of a rut?  You're still young!  
             You need to go out and get drunk...
    _Frasier walks around her toward the door of the booth._
        **Roz:**[_cont'd_] Wake up in some stranger's bed and not even remember 
             how you got there.
    **Frasier:**[_opening door_] In other words, exchange my life for yours.
        **Roz:** Well, do what you want.  But you know what?  You could shake 
             up your life every once in a while, do something spur of the 
             moment.  Once, I finished work on a Friday and hopped a plane 
             to Acapulco, and I didn't pack anything but my toothbrush.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes, yes, I do remember you calling in sick one Monday 
             morning with a mariachi band in the background.
        **Roz:** Well, I was sick.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmmm. [_closes door_]
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene 2 - Int. Frasier's living room at the Elliot Bay Towers_
     **Daphne:**[_opening front door_] Oh, Doctor Crane!
      **Niles:** Daphne.
    _Niles walks into the apartment to place his coat on the sofa.  
    Daphne closes the door after him.  When he turns back toward her, 
    she has turned her back to him.  She is wearing a yellow sundress 
    which is unzipped to her lower back._
     **Daphne:** Thank God you're here.  My zip's stuck.
      **Niles:** Oh.
    _Niles walks to her and reaches for the zipper, watching her lower 
    back intently._
      **Niles:** Good thing I got here when I did.
     **Daphne:** Don't be afraid to grab hold and give it all you've got.
      **Niles:**[_looking up at the back of her head_] Okay.
     **Daphne:** Sometimes pulling it down a bit helps.
      **Niles:**[_looking up again_] Okay. [_pause_] Oh, dear.  I've zipped my 
             tie into your dress.  It won't come loose.
    _Niles leans down to examine his predicament._
     **Daphne:** Oh, let me see!
    _Daphne turns to look, jerking Niles by the tie in the process._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry!  It is stuck, isn't it?  Well, maybe some 
             liquid soap from the powder room will loosen it up.
    _Daphne walks to the bathroom, dragging Niles by the tie.  He is 
    leaned over, his face very close to her rear - most likely a 
    delightful scenario for him.  Just as Daphne has her hand on the 
    knob to the bathroom, Frasier walks in the front door, taking in 
    the scene before him.  He stares skeptically for several moments 
    as he closes the door behind him._
    **Frasier:** Niles, there's something on your tie.
     **Daphne:**[_grinning_] Doctor Crane was helping me with my dress, 
             and now he's caught.
    **Frasier:** Yes, he is. [_walks to Daphne, pushing Niles to the side 
             slightly_] Allow me. [_frees the zipper_] Ah, there.  All 
             right, there we go.
    _Frasier walks over to hang up her coat, and Daphne walks toward the 
    breakfast table._
     **Daphne:** What a relief.  I was just about to step right out of this 
             dress and embarrass poor Doctor Crane to death.
      **Niles:** Well, we all have to die of something. [_gazing longingly_]
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, I managed to score some reservations tonight at 
             San Gennaro.  You up for a little Italian?
      **Niles:** Actually, I'm going out with Maris, so I guess you could say 
             I'm up for a little Episcopalian. [_laugh_]
    **Frasier:**[_laughs, walking toward wet bar_] Like some sherry?
      **Niles:** Yes, thank you.
    **Frasier:** So, those counseling session must be going very well. 
             [_pouring sherry_]
      **Niles:** They are!  So, tonight, we thought it would be a kick to 
             recreate our very first date.
     **Daphne:**[_sitting at table_] Oh, that's sweet.
    _Martin walks in the front door with Eddie on his leash._
      **Niles:** Hey, dad.  In fact, that day my car was in the shop, so I'm 
             here to borrow Dad's car just like I did back then. [_Frasier 
             hands him his sherry_] Just saying that makes me feel so young.  
             "Gee, Dad, can I borrow the car?"
     **Martin:** You did that twice on the phone, and I didn't find it cute 
             then. [_reaching in pocket, pulling out keys_] Here you go.
    _Martin tosses his keys to Niles underhanded.  However, they sail 
    right by him and are caught by Frasier, who is standing behind him._
    **Frasier:**[_handing Niles the keys_] I just can't picture Maris in Dad's 
             '82 Impala.
      **Niles:** Neither could she, at first.  I'll never forget the look of 
             wonder on her face at touching vinyl for the first time.  
             She said it made her feel cheap and dirty, and she liked it. 
             [_proud_] I was her first bad boy. [_sits on couch_]
    **Frasier:** Uh-huh.  Yes, I remember the way you used to carry your 
             inhaler around rolled up in the sleeve of your t-shirt. 
             [_gesturing to Daphne at the table and Martin coming out of 
             the kitchen_] Oh, how about you two?  You guys want to join 
             me for dinner tonight?
     **Martin:** Oh sorry, Sherry's cooking me dinner tonight.
     **Daphne:** And I have a date with Greg.
    **Frasier:** Greg?  I don't believe I've met him yet.
     **Martin:** I have.  He's gorgeous. [_stares all around_] Well, he is.
     **Daphne:** He's certainly the best-looking man I've ever been out with. 
             Of course, he doesn't have a thought in that pretty little 
             head of his. [_distantly_] Hmmm, this could be the one.
     **Martin:**[_going to sit in chair_] But you know, Frasier, maybe I can 
             have Sherry cook for me some other time.
    **Frasier:** No, no.  You don't have to put yourself out on my account,    
             Dad. [_notices answering machine blinking_] Oh Dad, did you 
             happen to check this message?
     **Martin:** No, I don't touch that thing.
    Message: [_V.O._] Hi, it's Laura.  We're getting an extra day of 
             rehearsal, so I'm coming in tonight instead of tomorrow. 
             American, Flight 11, 10:30.  Can't wait.  Bye!
    **Frasier:** Great news, Laura's in town!
      **Niles:** Who's Laura?
    **Frasier:** A stranger who called my machine by mistake.
    _END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO
    
    Scene 1 - Int. the restaurant - San Gennaro
    Frasier stands at the maitre 'd's booth in the restaurant, his arm 
    propped against it casually._
      **Frasier:** Reservation for Doctor Frasier Crane.
    **Maitre �D:** From the radio, yes?
      **Frasier:** Yes.  Ooh, actually my date canceled, so it'll just be me.
    **Maitre �D:** I see, sir. [_lowers voice_] Table for one.
      **Frasier:** There is no need to lower your voice.  I'm not ashamed to 
               dine alone.  eally, as a man of some celebrity, I can serve 
               as a symbol to others who might otherwise be afraid to do 
               so.  I mean, really it's okay, it's actually even preferable 
               to sit and dine alone rather than listen to someone who's 
               too much in love with his own voice prattle on endlessly.
    **Maitre �D:** Well, you convinced me, sir.  I'll see if your table's 
               ready.
    _The Maitre 'D leaves the room, and Frasier is left alone, looking 
    decidedly less comfortable._
    **Maitre �D:**[_loudly_] Doctor Crane?  Your table for one is ready.
    _He holds a menu out for Frasier, who takes it and slinks to his 
    table, which is positioned right in the center of the room._
    **Frasier:** Uh, listen, is it possible to move to... to have a table 
             elsewhere?  I feel just a bit conspicuous right here.
     **Waiter:** I'm very sorry, sir, but they're all reserved.  But don't 
             worry, most of our patrons only have eyes for each other.
    **Frasier:** Very well.
    _Frasier sits.  The waiter begins to fix the place setting, clinking 
    glasses together very loudly.  Other diners begin to look at the 
    table._
     **Waiter:** I'm so sorry, sir.
    **Frasier:** Perfectly all right.  Just because I'm alone doesn't mean 
             I'm lonely.  Perhaps I could have a glass of your house 
             cabernet.
    _A young boy approaches as Frasier fixes his napkin in his lap._
     **Johnny:** Hi.
    **Frasier:** Hello.  What's your name?
     **Johnny:** Johnny.  How come nobody's sitting with you?
    **Frasier:** Well, that's a bit complicated, Johnny.
     **Johnny:** My mom and dad said it's okay if you come sit with us.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, that's a very... very sweet offer, and I know it's 
             hard for a young boy to understand, but really, there's 
             nothing wrong with someone eating by himself.
     **Johnny:** You know, one time I was really bad at school and the 
             teacher made me eat lunch all by myself.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well that gave you an opportunity to think about your 
             actions, didn't it?
     **Johnny:** Nope.  I just cried.
    **Frasier:**[_rolls eyes_] Run along, Johnny.
    _Johnny leaves.  The waiter approaches._
     **Waiter:** Your glass of cabernet, sir.
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you.
     **Waiter:** Oh, and I see your candle has gone out. [_shouts_] Enrico! 
             [_claps loudly_]
    **Frasier:** Please, stop!  Tonight, I'd prefer to just... dine in the 
             shadows, thank you.
    _An attractive woman approaches._
      **Woman:** Excuse me.  Are you here by yourself?
    **Frasier:** As a matter of fact I am, yes.
      **Woman:** I was hoping you'd say that!  Would you mind if I - 
             [_gestures at the other chair at the table_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, good Lord, yes.  I've actually been sitting here hoping 
             somebody would- [_realization passing over him_] make good use 
             of that chair.
    _As the woman takes the chair away..._
     **Amanda:** AAAHHHH! [_jumps up_] Of course I'll marry you!
    _The scream has startled Frasier, who spills his cabernet all over 
    his shirt._
        **Ethan:** Oh, sorry for the commotion, folks. [_notices spilled wine, 
               walks over_] Oh, gosh, is that our fault?  Listen, let me 
               pay for the dry cleaning!
      **Frasier:** Oh, not to worry, not to worry.
    **Maitre �D:** Congratulations, you two!  Here's to young love!
      **Husband:**[_standing with his wife_] Well, as long as we're all 
               sharing good news, my wife just told me that we're having 
               twins.
        **Ethan:** Now that I've already interrupted all of your meals, I'd 
               just like to share my joy with everyone here. [_gazes at his 
               fiance_] To Amanda, my future bride, I will love you every 
               day of my life, and I hope that, when we die, it's at the 
               exact same moment so that neither of us will have to spend 
               even one second alone again.
    _Everyone applauds, including Frasier, but VERY grudgingly.  He looks 
    around, frowns, thinks a bit, and finally stands and walks over to 
    Johnny's table._
    **Frasier:** Hi, um, Johnny said I could eat with you.
    _FADE TO:_
    **LOVE AMONG THE RUINS**
    _Scene 2 - Int. Frasier's living room at the Elliot Bay Towers.
    Frasier walks in the front door of his apartment.  Martin and Daphne 
    are sitting at the breakfast table._
     **Martin:** Hey, Fras, how was your dinner?
    **Frasier:**[_walking slowly behind the couch_] Not since Quasimodo strolled 
             the streets of medieval Paris have so many people uttered the 
             phrase, "That poor man."
     **Daphne:** I'm sure it wasn't as bad as all that.
    **Frasier:** Oh? [_opens his overcoat to reveal his red shirt and tie_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, dear.
    **Frasier:**[_walks to hang up his overcoat_] The height of the evening came 
             when the entire staff of waiters delivered the birthday cake 
             that I'd ordered for Roz and neglected to cancel. [_pause_] They 
             sang to me. [_walks over to lean against Martin's chair_]
     **Martin:** It's not your birthday.
    **Frasier:** Staying right with the story as usual, Dad.  Anyway, after 
             dinner I took a long stroll, and it suddenly struck me: 
             I'm single.  I'd gotten accustomed to thinking of myself as 
             recently divorced, but that was five years ago.  I'm forty-
             three, and I'm alone.
     **Martin:** Hey! [_stands and walks to kitchen_] I have something that'll 
             cheer you up.  I brought you some of Sherry's mock apple pie. 
             [_comes out_] It's called "mock" cause they uses crackers 
             instead of apples.
    **Frasier:** Good! [_doorbell; Frasier walks to answer door_] Nothing spoils 
             an apple pie like apples. [_opening door_] Oh, Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier!  Oh, what happened?
    **Frasier:** Well-
      **Niles:** No, let me guess. [_leans in_] Robust color, fruity bouquet. 
             I'd say that's an amusing little merlot.
    **Frasier:** Cabernet. [_closes door_]
      **Niles:**[_walking past him_] Oh.  Well, it's still amusing.
     **Daphne:** So, did you and Mrs. Crane enjoy recreating your first date?
      **Niles:**[_standing behind chair at the breakfast table; very excited_] 
             Oh yes, my Maris remembered details that I'd forgotten.  For 
             example, when I brought her home after the restaurant, we 
             took a stroll around the grounds.  Suddenly, Marta appeared 
             on the balcony playing the part of Maris's late father.  She 
             was liquored up on Rob Roys and firing Swedish meatballs at 
             me from an antique blunderbuss.
    **Frasier:**[_glances down at answering machine_] Dad, am I the only one 
             in this household who checks this machine?
      **Laura:**[_V.O._] Hi, Molly.  Laura again.
    **Frasier:** Again.
      **Laura:**[_V.O._] Is that Tom on the machine?  He sounds nice.  Anyway, 
             I just called to remind you I'll have my cello with me. 
             Translation: you might want to clean out your car this time 
             to make room.  I know, _toujours la grande souer_.  Anyway, I 
             can't wait to see you guys.  I've been on my own way too 
             much lately.  See you at 10:30, Flight 11.  Love you.  
             Goodbye.
    
    [_N.B. French, "always the big sister."_]
    
     **Daphne:** Too bad there's no way to call her back.  She's gonna be 
             stranded at the airport.
    **Frasier:** Oh no, she won't, she'll take a cab.
     **Daphne:** You know, that happens a lot.  People leaving wrong messages. 
             And after hearing a stranger's voice like that, it always 
             starts me wondering what they must be like.
     **Martin:** Oh, you can't really judge what a person's like from the 
             voice.
      **Niles:**[_looking at Sherry's mock apple pie on the breakfast table_] 
             That's true.  I was once told that I sound - imagine the 
             impertinence - [_enunciating_] "UP-TIGHT."
     **Daphne:** Well, she sounds to me like a very attractive woman. 
             Intelligent -
      **Niles:** She speaks French.
    **Frasier:** I always loved the name Laura.
     **Martin:** Hey Frasier, you know, that was gonna be your name if you 
             were a girl.
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah!  Your mother always wanted Priscilla, but I never 
             liked the nickname "Prissy."
      **Niles:**[_cutting a slice_] Mmmm, I never much cared for it, either.
    _Frasier smiles at the irony and sits down on his couch._
     **Daphne:** You know, Doctor Crane, this Laura sounds like she might just 
             be a perfect match for you.  If you left now, you could meet 
             that plane.
    **Frasier:**[_laugh_] Oh, please, Daphne, a couple phone calls and you're 
             fixing us up already.
     **Daphne:** But think about it!  She plays the cello.  You'd like that. 
             [_stands and walks toward Frasier_]
      **Niles:** She appreciates neatness. [_following Daphne_]
     **Martin:** She expresses affection easily.  That's good. [_receives 
             stares from everyone_] Well, pardon me for growing a little, 
             okay?
    _Daphne perches on the arm of the sofa.  Martin sits in his chair. 
    Niles stands between them._
      **Niles:** She did mention being on her own too much.  So we know she's 
             available.
    **Frasier:** Oh, sure it's fun to speculate, but, come on, you can't 
             seriously be suggesting-
     **Daphne:** But why not?  I can't imagine a more exciting way to meet. 
             The woman of your dreams steps off a plane, and there you 
             are to rescue her.
    _Niles is watching her tenderly.  Very sweet._
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah, you can't beat meeting somebody in a romantic way. 
             That's the way it was with me and your mom.
      **Niles:** You met Mother over the chalk outline of a murder victim.
     **Martin:** So?  It was romantic to us.
     **Daphne:** I met a boy in a cute way once.  I was eighteen and visiting 
             Stonehenge and this smashing young man came up to me and 
             told me he was an actual descendent of the Druids.
    **Frasier:** Boy, is that the one place that line would work.
      **Niles:** I met someone once flying home from college.  I got bumped 
             into first class, found myself sitting there next to a 
             positively ravishing woman.  She was a bit older and I was 
             trying desperately to be suave, so when she leaned over and 
             suggested we join the Mile High Club, rather than admit I 
             was unfamiliar with the term, I whispered back, "I really 
             don't travel enough to make that worthwhile." [_pauses, takes 
             a sip of sherry_] God, that was twenty years ago. [_starts 
             to chuckle, then_] Nope, still can't laugh about it.
    
    [_N.B. For those of you unfamiliar with the term, an invitation to 
    "join the Mile High Club" is an offer to have sex on an airplane._]
    _Frasier stands and walks back over to the message machine.  He hits a 
    button._
      **Laura:**[_V.O._] Hi, Molly.  Laura again.  Is that Tom on the machine?  
             He sounds nice.  Anyw-
    _Frasier stops the machine and turns around._
    **Frasier:** She likes the sound of my voice.  She's called me twice 
             today.  That's already the best relationship I've had this 
             year.
     **Martin:** So, are you going?
    **Frasier:** Maybe.  Oh, I don't know.
     **Daphne:** There's nothing worse than when you look back on a missed 
             opportunity.
    **Frasier:** What the hell! [_runs to grab his overcoat_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm so excited.
    **Frasier:** I can't believe I'm actually doing this! [_runs to the door_]
      **Niles:** Frasier, before you go-
    **Frasier:** No, Niles, stop right there!  Don't say another word to me! 
             I'll never do something this impulsive if I stop to overthink 
             it.  Just let me get the hell out of here before I change my 
             mind!
    _He slams the door behind him.  Several moments go by before he opens 
    it again and dashes toward his room._
    **Frasier:** But not before I change my shirt.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 3 - Int. airport
    People are de-boarding the plane.  Several people hold signs.  
    The first says, "IBM."  The second says, "DR. THOMPKINS."  Frasier, 
    clearly nervous, stands with a sign with crude capital letters: 
    "LAURA."
    
    Then Laura, a beautiful woman in her thirties, appears, maneuvering 
    her cello case with the help of a flight attendant._
      **Laura:** Thanks for all your help.  I can take it from here.
    **Frasier:**[_leaning forward, speaking hesitantly_] Uh, Laura?  Looking 
             for Molly?
      **Laura:** Yes, I am.  Molly sent a driver?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, no. [_sincere smile_] I'm not a driver, I'm a 
             psychiatrist, I'm here to help you.
      **Laura:**[_long pause_] Molly's having me committed?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no!  I'm Doctor Frasier Crane.
      **Laura:** Oh, from the radio!
    **Frasier:** Oh, you know me!
      **Laura:** Yes, I've heard your show, it's great!  But your knowing me 
             is just - weird.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually... you left a couple messages on my machine 
             today by mistake.
      **Laura:** Oh, no.  I must've gotten my sister's new number wrong.
    **Frasier:** I didn't want you waiting around for someone who wasn't 
             coming.
      **Laura:** So you came all the way down here?  What're you, like the 
             nicest guy in the world?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Yes, I am.  Well, speaking of nice, I would be 
             delighted to drive you to your sister's home.
      **Laura:** Oh, no, no, no, I'll take a cab.
    **Frasier:** Are you sure?  It's no trouble at all.
      **Laura:** Well, she lives an hour away.  But, uh, listen, could I buy 
             you a drink just to say thank you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'd love that. [_gesturing to the instrument case_] May I 
             take your cello?
      **Laura:** Aaahhhh... I checked my cello, this is my purse. 
    _Long pause; Frasier seems confused, totally at a loss as to what 
    to say._
      **Laura:**[_jokingly annoyed_] I think that's funny.  Why doesn't anybody 
             laugh at that?
    **Frasier:** That is funny!  Here. [_takes case, leads them toward airport 
             bar_] So, are you with an orchestra? [_puts cello case to the 
             side_]
      **Laura:** With a chamber music group, actually.  We're based in LA, but 
             we travel quite a bit. [_sits_] I grew up here, so it's always 
             nice to come back.  I miss it.
    **Frasier:** So, what'll you have?
      **Laura:** Um... I think I'll have a glass of sherry.
    **Frasier:**[_pleasantly surprised_] Two.
      **Laura:** Not that you can expect that much from airport bar sherry. 
             [_guiltily_] Oh, goodness.  Don't I sound like the perfect 
             snob?
    **Frasier:**[_dreamily_] Yes... [_catches himself_] I mean, I agree with 
             you about the sherry.  So... um... why did you choose the 
             cello?
      **Laura:** When I was around eleven, my father took me to the symphony. 
             And this sounds a little silly, but when I heard the cello, 
             it sounded sad, like it needed me.
    **Frasier:**[_moved_] That's not silly.  It's lovely.
      **Laura:** I was always an odd kid.  All my girlfriends had posters of 
             David Cassidy. I had Pablo Cassall.
    **Frasier:** I had Sigmund Freud. [_laughs_]
      **Laura:** But did you kiss him every night before you went to bed?
    **Frasier:** Well, I... I was tempted to, but he just would've read too 
             much into it! [_they laugh; their drinks come_] Oh, thank you.
      **Laura:** I don't think I've ever shared a drink with a psychiatrist. 
             I'm worried that you must be analyzing me.
    **Frasier:** Well, if I am, my diagnosis so far is that I... I can't find 
             a single thing wrong with you.
      **Laura:**[_takes sip of sherry_] Actually, it's quite good!
    **Frasier:** Yes.  My second pleasant surprise this evening.
      **Laura:** Frasier, maybe I'm misreading you here, but - I'm married.
    **Frasier:**[_slowly, very disappointed_] Oh... somehow I jumped to the 
             conclusion that you were single.  Wasn't there something in 
             your message about having been on your own too much, lately?
      **Laura:** Oh, I've been away on tour.
    **Frasier:** Oh... Well, I guess by now you've probably figured out that 
             my coming down here wasn't entirely the act of a Good 
             Samaritan.  More like a lonely Samaritan.  Guess it makes me 
             seem sort of desperate.
      **Laura:** No... I think it makes you seem sort of romantic.  I used to 
             do things like this when I was single.  It was fun.
    **Frasier:** Clearly, you were better at being single than I am.
      **Laura:** Oh, come on.  Let me ask you a question.  How did you feel, 
             coming down here?
    **Frasier:** I felt... completely exhilarated.  In fact, it's the most 
             fun I've had in recent memory.
      **Laura:** Exactly.  The anticipation, the excitement, the hope. 
             Marriage is the death of all that.
    **Frasier:** I hope you didn't write your own vows.
      **Laura:**[_laughs_] I'm not down on marriage.  It's just that marriage 
             can be great, but so can not being married.
    **Frasier:** I suppose. [_pause_] Well, you're smart, lovely, talented, 
             able to look at the bright side of things.  I'm getting 
             more disappointed by the moment.
      **Laura:**[_sincerely_] I'm sorry it didn't turn out the way you wanted.
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't be.  Look, I really did have fun.  You know, it's 
             not very often that I do something impulsive.
      **Laura:** Well, maybe you should. [_pause_] Well, I really should be 
             going.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, here, allow me.  Allow me.  I'm the nicest guy in 
             the world, remember? [_stands to retrieve cello_]
      **Laura:** I'll remember. [_stands_]
    **Frasier:** Here we are. [_hands over the cello_]
      **Laura:** This is probably a ridiculous thing to say, but if I weren't 
             married-
    **Frasier:** No, you don't have to finish that, but thank you very much 
             for starting it.
      **Laura:**[_barely audible_] Okay.
    _Laura turns to leave, but in the process, her cello case knocks over 
    one of the metal stools at the bar._
    **Frasier:** Oh!  Let me get that for you.
    _Frasier bends down to lift the chair.  Laura walks back over and 
    leans toward him, her eyebrow raised worriedly._
      **Laura:** If you ever think back on this, could you just-
    **Frasier:**[_broad, sweeping gesture_] I'll just edit that part out.
      **Laura:**[_nods_] Thank you.
    _Laura walks away.  Frasier sits down, nursing his sherry.  A dark-
    haired woman comes on from off-stage._
    **Announcement:**...4 will depart from Gate 31.  Passengers may proceed 
                  to the....
    
      **Woman:** Excuse me.
    **Frasier:** Mmm-hmmm? 
      **Woman:** Did you just hear that gate change announcement?
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, but perhaps they can help you at the 
             ticket counter.
      **Woman:** Oh, good idea. Thanks. [_beginning to leave_]
    **Frasier:** Where're you headed?
      **Woman:** Mexico.  How about you?
    **Frasier:** Oh well, I'm just going to finish up my sherry, and then 
             I'm off to.... [_moment of inspiration_] I'm going to Mexico! 
      **Woman:** Really?  Acapulco?
    **Frasier:**[_stands to walk with her_] It's uncanny!  What hotel are you 
             staying at?
      **Woman:** Via Terra.
    **Frasier:** Why, that's where I'm staying!  You're scaring me!
    _FADE OUT as they board the plane._
