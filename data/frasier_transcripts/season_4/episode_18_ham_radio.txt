    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Caf e Nervosa.
    Frasier orders "a tall skinny to go" before briefly sitting with 
    Martin and Niles.
    _
    **Frasier:** You know I've only got a moment, you know I've started a
             very exciting project.
      **Niles:** Oh really?
    **Frasier:** Yes, you know this is KACL's fiftieth anniversary.  I did a
             little research and found out they used to specialise in
             live radio dramas.  So, I'm putting one on.  Dad, surely you
             must remember those?
     **Martin:** Oh sure.
    **Frasier:** Yes, people of dad's generation would sit around at night,
             listening to the radio absolutely mesmerised. 
     **Martin:** We were simple people. 
    **Frasier:** All right, dad.  Anyway, I've spoken to the station manager.
             He's given me thirty minutes, to re-create the very first
             mystery KACL ever aired; "Nightmare Inn."
     **Martin:** Oh don't tell me, I know: A bunch of people get caught in a 
             storm, and everyone's wondering who's going to be the first 
             one murdered.
    **Frasier:** Exactly, and I'm going to direct.
      **Niles:** So, we can stop wondering.
     **Martin:** What, don't you think your brother knows how to direct?
      **Niles:** No, the trouble is he doesn't know how to stop directing.
             During our prep school production of "Richard III" he drove
             the entire cast crazy with his constant critiquing.  I seem 
             to recall a delay on the opening night while our Richard 
             chased Frasier around the dressing room, beating him with 
             his hump. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, that was just a little backstage horseplay to relieve
             tension. 
      **Niles:** You'll have an Orson Welles complex.  By the end of this 
             week, you'll not only be directing, you'll have re-written 
             the script and be playing the lead.
    **Frasier:** I have no intention of performing in it myself.  The only re-
             writing I've done is simply cutting to get it down to thirty
             minutes. 
     **Martin:**[_reading script title:_] "Frasier Crane's Nightmare Inn."
    **Frasier:**[_snatching script from Martin_] It's just a working title!
             [_exits_]
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - Radio Station
    At KACL, Frasier has just finished his radio show.  However, he still
    needs to remind everyone about the upcoming radio play._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on air:_] Well, that's our show for today, but let me remind
             you to tune in on Saturday night for KACL's presentation of
             "Nightmare Inn."  Just set your dials for goosebumps.  Till
             then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane reminding you that [_in a
             ghoulish creepy voice, which sounds down-right hilarious:_]
             you never know what's lurking in the shadows. 
    
    _He gives a ghoulish laugh, and carries on laughing when he switches 
    off the air and as Roz walks into his booth._
    
        **Roz:** Well, that should certainly comfort the woman who called in
             about her paranoia.  Listen, do we have a leading man yet?
    **Frasier:** No.
        **Roz:** Well, you could do it.
    **Frasier:** Oh don't be silly, Roz.  It is a juicy part, it does call 
             for a strong voice, but believe me, my hands are full.
        **Gil:**[_enters_] Oh, Frasier, I've had a quick peek at your script
             and I think I'd be perfect as Bull Kragen, the brutish
             gamekeeper.
    **Frasier:**[_looks at Roz in disbelief_] You know Gil, I think that's
             just a bit too on the nose. [_Gil agrees_] But you know who
             you could play?  Mr. Nigel Fairservice, drummed out of the
             Royal Air Force under mysterious circumstances.
        **Roz:**[_to Frasier:_] With him playing it, they might not seem so
             mysterious. [_Frasier hits her_]
        **Gil:** I'll take it.  After all, Nigel does have that divine speech
             in the second act about his boyhood in Surrey.  "Romping 
             with his school chums in the fens and spinneys, when the 
             twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent flame."  
             Actually, I had rather a long peek at the script. [_exits_]
        **Roz:** Gosh, we still have a lot of these supporting roles to cast.
    **Frasier:** Well actually, I'm working on that.  You know, Jennifer down
             in accounting is married to a professional actor, who
             specialises in dialects.  I'm thinking of asking him to play
             six or seven of the smaller parts.
    **Bulldog:**[_entering_] Hey Doc, need one more for your play?
    **Frasier:** Absolutely Bulldog, just as long as you promise to promote
             it on your show.
    **Bulldog:** Actually I wasn't talking about me, I was talking about a
             friend of mine; Maxine. 
    **Frasier:** Does she have any experience?
    **Bulldog:** Are you kidding?!  If she had a dollar for every minute she
             spent on stage... [_thinks_] Oh wait a minute, she does.
    **Frasier:** Well, we do still have a part open for the maid, she only 
             has one line.
    **Bulldog:** Does it have any big words?
    **Frasier:** No, it's simple; [_acting:_] "Look out, he's got a gun!"
    **Bulldog:** Maxine could knock that line right out of the park.
    **Frasier:** Well, OK, but you've got to agree to play a part too.  We
             still need someone for the sinister silk merchant. 
    **Bulldog:** OK, it's a deal.  Maxine is going to be so excited.  I gotta
             remember to pick her up one of those cute little French maid
             outfits on my way home from work.
    **Frasier:** It's radio, Bulldog, she doesn't have to appear in costume.
    **Bulldog:** Maybe here she doesn't! 
    
    _Frasier and Roz walk out of the booth and carry on their
    conversation as they walk down the hallway._
    
        **Roz:** Well, we're getting there. 
    **Frasier:** Except the lead!  I haven't found anyone remotely qualified
             to play a wily old Scotland Yard inspector.  You know, you
             might be right, Roz, I'll have to bite the bullet and take
             on the part myself. 
    
    _They bump into Ian, a man who looks and talks exactly like an 
    inspector._
    
        **Ian:**[_takes pipe out of mouth_] Excuse me, Dr. Crane, is it too
             late to read for role of the inspector?
    **Frasier:** I'm afraid the role has already been cast. 
    _Roz and Ian look stunned as Frasier walks away happy with himself. 
    
    FADE TO:_
    **HAM RADIO**
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Later, in Frasier's apartment, Daphne answers the door.  Roz, Bulldog, 
    Gil and Mel the actor enter._
     **Daphne:** Come on in.
        **Roz:** Hello, Daphne.
        **Gil:** Hello.
    **Frasier:** Bulldog, Gil, right on time.  We have to be on our toes
             tonight, we have a professional actor with us, Mel White,
             our man of a thousand voices.
        **Gil:** Oh, it's a huge pleasure.
    **Frasier:** Mel's going to play Hans the German butler, both McAllister
             sisters, and Pepo the dwarf; a little man with a big secret. 
    **Bulldog:** The same guy's playing all those parts?
    **Frasier:** Yes, he's also playing Bull Kragen the game keeper, and 
             O'Toole the handy man.  Do you think you're up to it, Mel?
        **Mel:** Just so long they don't all talk at once! 
    **Frasier:**[_excited:_] Isn't it lovely to be working with a
             professional! [_to Bulldog:_] Bulldog, where's Maxine?
    **Bulldog:** Oh, she's home with food poisoning, it's nothing serious.  
             I think she just wrestled in some bad Jell-O. 
    **Frasier:** Never mind, she just has one line anyway. [_acting:_] Look
             out, he's got a gun! [_sympathetically:_] You think you might
             be up to that this evening, Daphne?
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastically:_] I'll try!
        **Gil:** Frasier, one of Nigel's lines seems to be missing. 
    **Frasier:** Why yes, I had to cut the play by twenty minutes.
        **Gil:** Oh yes, but that line so neatly defined Nigel's character.
    **Frasier:** Saying "Gesundheit" after the butler sneezes?!
        **Gil:** It shows he's a caring person. 
    **Frasier:** It's cut, Gil.  Learn to let go.
        **Gil:** Oh very well, as long as I still have that delicious speech
             about my boyhood in Surrey.
    **Frasier:** Yes that's still in. 
        **Gil:** "Romping with my school chums in the fens and spinneys..."
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes that one.  Thank you.  All right, I fear we might
             be running just a bit long still, so I've asked Daphne to
             time us this evening and also Noel hasn't rounded up all the
             sound effects yet, so I'm gonna have Daphne read those
             directions as well.  Now that's a lot of responsibility on
             you Daphne, are you sure you're up to it? [_She looks at him
             as if to say "I have some use"_] All right, start the watch.
             Stage direction.
     **Daphne:** Sound of door opening.
        **Roz:**[_with cheese in her mouth_] Inspactar, thank goddies cam. 
    **Frasier:** Stop the watch.  Roz, I have a line here that says, "when 
             she opened her lips I caught a hint of some mixed exotic 
             accent."  You will notice it does not say, "when she opened 
             her lips cheese fell out". [_to Daphne:_] Start the watch. 
             [_acting:_] This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndike.
     **Daphne:** Sound of door closing.
        **Roz:**[_exotic:_] I can't believe any of my guests could be a
             multiple murderer. 
    **Frasier:** That's easy for you to say, but my job is to suspect
             everyone.  Please introduce me to your guests.
        **Roz:**[_exotic:_] This is the silk merchant, Mr. Wang.
    **Bulldog:**[_laughs_] 
    **Frasier:** Stop the watch.  What's your problem?
    **Bulldog:** Wang?  You've gotta give me another name, I'll crack up 
             every time I hear that!!
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, how about Wing?  That's a great old 
             Chinese name.  Everybody change Wang to Wing in your scripts.
     **Daphne:** Sound of people changing Wangs to Wings.
    **Frasier:** From your line.  Start it.
        **Roz:**[_exotic:_] This is the silk merchant, Mr. Wing.
    **Frasier:** Do you see anything suspicious, Wing?
    **Bulldog:**[_Chinese impersonation:_] Oh, me no looky, me go very by
             chop-chop.
        **Roz:** Stop!  Chinese embassy on line one!  You can't say that.
    **Frasier:** All right, it's all right, I'll just adjust his dialogue 
             later.  Start.
        **Gil:** I'm Nigel Fairservice, inspector.  I was strolling in the
             garden when this dreadful tragedy occurred.
    **Frasier:** Did anyone see you?
        **Gil:** Several people.  Hans, the German butler.
        **Mel:**[_German voice:_] Ja, I saw zee Gentleman. 
    **Frasier:** Stop! [_to Mel:_] That's wonderful, Mel.  But he sounds to me 
             just a bit more Austrian than German. 
        **Mel:** I've done that accent both on Broadway and the London stage!
    **Frasier:** Yes, well perhaps they have different standards than I have.
             All right everyone, from the beginning once again.  Now let's
             try hard people, dig in!  And try to find the reality. 
             From the dwarf's entrance.
    
    _Later, Frasier is finishing another rehearsal._
    
    **Frasier:** "And so the case was closed, and with a grateful shudder, I
             swore I'd never return to Nightmare Inn."  Stop.  Time?
     **Daphne:** That's 32 minutes, 40 seconds
    **Frasier:** Damn!  I'll have try to pin some more before we try again.
        All: Again?!
    **Frasier:** Please, we're doing it until I'm completely satisfied, and
             that reminds me, Mel - I'm still not entirely happy with the
             second McAllister sister!  She doesn't sound spinsterish
             enough for me.
        **Mel:** I see.  You also told me that my gamekeeper sounded too
             cultured, that my Irishman sounded more Protestant than
             Catholic, and that my dwarf was too tall.  Let me try Hans
             again, tell me how my German is sounding: "I Q-vit!" [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, wait!
     **Daphne:** Sound of door slamming.
    **Bulldog:** So what do we do now, boss?
    **Frasier:** Not to worry, I have a plan. [_picks up phone_]
        **Roz:** Oh yeah right, we're supposed to do this thing tomorrow
             night.  Where are you going to find an idiot willing to take
             six dialect parts unrehearsed? 
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Niles.
     **Daphne:** Sound of ominous organ music indicating trouble ahead. 
    _Everyone except Frasier chuckles along.
    
    End Of Act One. (Time: 9:15)
    
    Act Two. 
    
    Scene One - Radio Studio
    In the recording studio, Frasier is talking to Gil._
    
        **Gil:** Oh there's your brother, how's he enjoying the prospect of
             playing six parts?
    **Frasier:** Actually, he doesn't know about it yet.  He would have never
             agreed. 
      **Niles:**[_enters_] Frasier, you told me you were going to message the
             script to me this morning. 
    **Frasier:** I'm so, so sorry.  I was tinkering with it till the very 
             last minute, but not to worry.  Your natural talent will 
             carry you through.  Look, take a look at this. [_they walk to 
             Noel beside a bench with strange objects on_] Noel is going 
             to give us a demonstration of the sound effects.  What have 
             you got, Noel?
       **Noel:** OK!  This is my door sound: [_opens fake door_] My thunder
             screen: [_sounds it_] Balloons for gun shots: [_bursts one_] And
             this plays various kinds of organ music: [_he demonstrates_]
             I've also got a gravel box, bells, a rain stick and a coffee 
             thermos.
    **Frasier:** What does that do?
       **Noel:** It keeps my coffee warm.
    **Bulldog:**[_enters with Maxine_] Everybody, this is Maxine.
    **Frasier:** Hello.  Welcome.
     **Maxine:** Hi, I need a quiet place to work on my part.
    **Bulldog:** Oh, you got it baby, why don't you go up here in the booth.
             [_Maxine exits._]
    **Frasier:** Bulldog, work on her part?!  It's just one line.
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, yeah, but she's got that condition.  What d'ya call it,
             it begins with a dis... dis- dis... er?
      **Niles:** Distemper?
    **Bulldog:** No, Dyslexia, that's it.  She's dyslexic.
    **Frasier:** And you tell me that now.
    **Bulldog:** No, no, no, hey, she'll be great.  It's me I'm worried about,
             I've got some serious butterflies going here. 
    **Frasier:** Bulldog, you're on the radio all the time.
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, but that's me being me.  This is acting, it's scary.
    **Frasier:** Listen, that's all part of the thrill of the live performance.  
             Butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, scratchy throat, 
             pounding heart!  I suppose you have all of those?
    **Bulldog:** I do now!
        **Roz:**[_enters speaking with a numb mouth_] Phorry I'm late, Phaser,
             I just sphent two hours in the dentist chair.  An emergenphie, 
             Ohh.
        **Gil:** What is the matter?
        **Roz:** Novocaine, he said it would wear opph by now.  I keep 
             biteing my 'ip.
    **Frasier:** Dear God, we've got sixty seconds.
      **Niles:** I don't even know who I'm playing.
    **Frasier:** Don't worry Niles, I'll just cue you as we go along.
      **Niles:** Shouldn't I at least prepare a little?
    **Frasier:** Now, listen, your natural spontaneity is your best asset as
             an actor.  What was it the Yale "Daily News" said about your
             Tartuffe?
      **Niles:** Oh, who remembers? [_off heart_] That I have the magnetism of 
             Marlon Brando, the charm of Danny Kaye and the range of 
             Laurence Olivier.
    **Frasier:** All right everyone, places please.
    
    _Meanwhile, Daphne listens to it in Frasier's apartment.  Eddie is
    also there on Frasier's favourite window chair.  Martin hurries in._
    
     **Daphne:** Hurry up, it's starting. [_ominous organ music heard_]
    **Frasier:**[_radio:_] Good evening, this is Frasier Crane to welcome you
             to KACL's recreation of the original mystery theatre... 
     **Daphne:** I already know the plot, but I'll try not to blurt out the
             name of the murderer.
     **Martin:** Great!  As a cop I hated it when people did that.
    
    _In the radio studio, Frasier is on air and begins his play._
    
    **Frasier:** In all my years at the Yard, I doubt I'd ever seen a fouler
             night [_thunder sound effect_] than that on which I was called
             out to investigate a double murder at the old inn on the
             moors. [_door sound effect_] The door was answered by Miss
             Carlotta Thorndike. [_door shuts_] Her face was unfamiliar and
             when she opened her lips I caught a hint of some exotic
             accent.
        **Roz:** Inphector, ow!  Phank God you ca'.
    **Frasier:** This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndike.
        **Roz:** I can't beweive any of my guests cod be a... mopible mupuder.
    **Frasier:** That's easy for you to say.  But my job is to suspect
             everybody.  Please, introduce me to your... no, no, never
             mind.  I know your guests by reputation.  This must be Mr.
             Wing, the silk merchant.  Did you witness anything 
             suspicious, Wing? [_Bulldog freezes on the spot so Frasier 
             covers_] Of course, the inscrutable and mute Mr. Wing, 
             who wears a bell on his hat. [_goes to sound effects_] Did you 
             witness anything suspicious, Wing? [_Frasier shakes bell_] No, 
             eh?  I'll remember you said that.
        **Gil:** I'm Nigel Fairservice, Inspector.  I was strolling in the
             garden when this dreadful tragedy occurred. 
    **Frasier:** Did anyone see you?
        **Gil:** Several people.  Hans, the German butler. 
      **Niles:**[_Frasier cues him, speaking in German accent:_] Ja, I saw zee
             gentleman.
        **Gil:** O'Toole, the gardener.
      **Niles:**[_Frasier cues him, speaking in Irish accent:_] It �twas
             himself, and no mistake.
        **Gil:** As well as Prudence McAllister.
      **Niles:**[_Frasier cues him, speaking in an aristocrat lady accent:_]
             Yes, I was taking a breath of air.
    **Frasier:** I tried to shake Nigel's alibi, but each witness was adamant.
             O'Toole!
      **Niles:**[_Irish:_] Faith and it's true!
    **Frasier:** Hans!
      **Niles:**[_German:_] Ja, Voll!
    **Frasier:** Miss McAllister!
      **Niles:**[_old woman:_] Oh, please hence.
    **Frasier:** There remained one suspect, whose whereabouts had not yet
             been established - Pepo the dwarf, a retired circus
             performer.  Exactly where were you when the murders occurred, 
             Pepo?  
    
    _Frasier cues Niles, but Niles doesn't know how to do it.  He even
    tries to kneel down to appear he is small but realises it's radio.
    Frasier comes over to the sound effects bench and gives Niles a
    helium balloon to inhale._
    
    **Frasier:** Pepo, where were you?
      **Niles:**[_high voice:_] I was at the movies.
    **Frasier:** At the movies you say, well one quick phone call can verify
             that!
    
    _Frasier, still at the sound effects bench, pretends to dial the
    phone and pretends it isn't working._
    
    **Frasier:** What's this?  Dear God, the phone lines have been cut. 
             [_organ music_] Oh, we were really stranded.  Totally and 
             completely isolated from any contact with the outside world. 
    
    _The studio phone rings and Noel answers it.  Frasier walks over and
    cuts the telephone cord._
    
    **Frasier:** The phone lines have been repaired, you say? [_uses prop
             phone_] Hello?  Wait, they've gone dead again. 
    
    _Meanwhile, Martin and Daphne are listening to the end of the first
    act._
    
    **Frasier:**[_radio:_] Who knows what other surprises this night may bring?
             [_organ music sounds, whilst Martin turns off the radio_]
     **Martin:** I don't remember the plots of these things being so goofy! 
     **Daphne:** Mr. Wing wasn't mute last night. 
    
    _In the commercial break, Niles is discussing his parts with Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** Six different roles and six different accents, I have a mind
             to walk right out of here.
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm sorry, Niles, but you're doing brilliantly.  Except
             your Hans could be a bit gruffer!
      **Niles:** Don't direct me!
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, you're right.  I'm just a bit more worried of
             being over time.  Gil, at the bottom of page fourteen, 
             listen, after your shot just say "I'm dying," cut the rest.
        **Gil:** That's my boyhood in Surrey speech!
    **Frasier:** Yes, I know. 
        **Gil:** You can't cut that, you can't.
    **Frasier:** Stop whining!  We've got a play to do!
        **Gil:** I don't care anymore. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right, please, quiet everybody.  Ten seconds!  Oh,
             Maxine, be sure to watch out for your cue and please, people
             let's pick up the pace. [_organ music and on air:_] Nightmare
             Inn, Act Two.  I was baffled, they all had alibis.  Suddenly
             Miss Thorndike pointed, her eyes wide with alarm!
        **Roz:** There's somevon outside that phindow.
    **Frasier:** Why yes, Miss Thorndike, it appears to be... [_soft music 
             plays sounding like a fairy, Frasier covers_] The ice-cream 
             truck!  But never mind that, [_takes off leaves of paper_] 
             suddenly the storm put the lights out. [_thunder effect_] And 
             we were left with darkness.  Then a scream.
     **Maxine:** Ahhhh!  Look out, he's got a nug!
    **Frasier:** A gun!  A gun is what he's got.  When the lights came back 
             up, a smoking gun lay on the table.  The maid lay dead, 
             unable to name her killer.  Nigel Fairservice lay mortally 
             wounded.
        **Gil:** I'm dying!
    **Frasier:** Poor man was gone.
        **Gil:** Never again to visit the scene of my boyhood in Surrey,
             romping with my school chums in the fens and spinneys... 
    **Frasier:** Just then the lights went out again. [_gun sound_] Nigel
             Fairservice was shot again.
        **Gil:** Only grazed me.  When the twilight bathed the hedgerows like
             a lambent...
    **Frasier:**[_creates another shot_] The final bullet, blew his head clean
             off his shoulders.  All right people, let's try to keep calm
             although it's hard when the killer is among us.
        **Gil:**[_walks over and makes the door sound effect_] Hi-ho, I'm
             Nigel's brother Cedric, who I haven't seen since my boyhood...
    **Frasier:**[_creates yet another shot_] And so died the last surviving
             member of the Fairservice family.
    
    _In Frasier's apartment, Martin and Daphne are still listening in 
    disbelief._
    
     **Martin:** Boy, I sure didn't see that one coming!
        **Gil:**[_radio:_] Hello, I'm the ice cream man.  Years ago I went to
             school with Nigel Fairservice.  We used to romp in the fens
             and spinnies... [_gun shot_]
     **Daphne:** This is turning into a blood bath. 
     **Martin:** This is why I prefer TV, you want to be able to see that
             stuff!
    
    _Meanwhile, Frasier and the so-called cast are still having troubles._
    
    **Frasier:** By this time, I was more baffled than ever.  So I played a 
             hunch; Hans, may I see your fingernails?
      **Niles:**[_German:_] Vy?
    **Frasier:** They seem a bit ragged for a butler! 
      **Niles:**[_German:_] Alvight, Alvight, I'm not what I appear.  None of
             us is.  I'm not a butler, I'm not even... [_turns page_]
             German?! [_normal:_] Sit down, inspector, you are about to 
             hear a fascinating tale.  Each of us holds a piece of the 
             puzzle to relate to you.  When we've finished you will know 
             the full dark secret of "Nightmare Inn"!
        **Roz:** Are thu thew with phat, Hans?
      **Niles:** Be quiet, mother. [_organ here_] Mother and I moved here when
             I was a small boy after the... tragic death of my father...
    
    _Niles carries on with the script whilst Frasier gives some very
    strenuous directions with some weird actions.  Niles eventually loses
    it._
    
      **Niles:** I kept the pain of that loss buried deep within me like a
             serpent coiled within a damp... cave... [_throws script_] 
             That's it!  I'm just going to take this gun off the table. 
             [_takes balloons and bursts one_] Sorry about that, O'Toole, I 
             guess we'll never hear your fascinating piece of the puzzle. 
             [_two shots:_] Or yours, Kragen and Pepo!  Could the 
             McAllister sisters stand back to back, I'm short on bullets! 
             [_shot_] Thank you!  What was your name again, dear?
        **Roz:** Miph Thorndike.
      **Niles:** Thank you. [_shot_] Ah, and also Mr. Wing. [_shot sound with
             bell fading_] And of course, one final bullet for myself so
             the mystery will die with me. [_shot_] Ha! 
    _The cast go to the drinks._
    **Frasier:** Well then, that pretty much wrapped things up!  Hans was a 
             mass murderer, who to the surprise of everyone, the case was
             closed.  And with a grateful shudder, I swore I never would
             return to Nightmare Inn! 
    
    _Organ music plays however the producer signals time left._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, we still have nine minutes remaining.  Perhaps we 
             could have a little post-play discussion? 
    
    _Gil, Bulldog, Maxine, Roz and Niles look at Frasier as if to say
    "What the hell do you think?"
    
    End of Act Two. (Time: 21:00)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Noel is packing away his sound effects when he realises Niles's
    script on the floor.  He picks it up and has a go at reading it into
    the mike.  Roz, listening, silently creeps up behind him and bursts a
    balloon.  In shock, Noel drops his script and falls over. Roz looks
    mystified.
