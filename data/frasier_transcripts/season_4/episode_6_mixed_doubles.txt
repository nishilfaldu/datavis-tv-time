    _ACT ONE
    
    Scene One -- Frasier's Apartment
    Frasier is looking through the telescope.  Niles fidgets beside him.  
    Martin is reading the paper in his Armchair._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh my God... breathtaking.
      **Niles:** Well, don't be greedy!  Your turn was over forty seconds ago!
    **Frasier:** All right, all right, Niles, all right. [_steps away_] It's the 
             penthouse unit, fourth from the left.
      **Niles:**[_looking_] Oh, mama! 
     **Martin:** You two know that what you're doing isn't right, don't you?
    **Frasier:** We're simply admiring a very rare Brancusi armchair, not a 
             naked woman.
     **Martin:** That's what I'm talking about.
    
    _Daphne comes in the front door, dressed for an evening out._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, Daph.
     **Daphne:** Evening.
     **Martin:** You're home kind of early, aren't you? 
     **Daphne:** A bit.  Something... sort of happened.
     **Martin:** Oh, yeah?  What?
     **Daphne:** Well, Joe and I were having dinner.  Everything was nice as 
             could be, and I said, "Don't you like your potato?"  And he 
             said, "No, I'm not hungry for potato just now."  So I said, 
             "Well, if you don't like your potato you're welcome to try 
             my potato"--
    **Frasier:** Daphne?  Could we hasten to the post-potato portion of the 
             dialogue?
     **Daphne:** Well, that's when he said it.  He said we'd been "on-again, 
             off-again" for too long without making anything permanent, 
             so maybe it was best if we just broke up.
     **Martin:** Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.  You're sure taking it well.  Boy, if 
             you'd have told me Joe would end up dumping you tonight, 
             I'd have been--
     **Daphne:** Oh, God.  He dumped me!
    
    _She bursts into tears._
    
     **Martin:** Somebody comfort her!
      **Niles:** Right!
    
    _He moves to hug Daphne, obviously anxious for the opportunity.  But 
    Frasier gets there first.  She cries against his shoulder._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, this is so embarrassing.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no, no, never mind about that.  Expressing our emotions 
             is always beneficial, even if it does come at the expense of 
             our pride [_she blows her nose on his lapel_] and a very 
             expensive brand-new Italian silk jacket.
    
    _She keeps bawling._
    
    **Frasier:** You know, I don't seem to be doing much good here.  Why don't 
             one of you give it a try?
      **Niles:** Very well.
    _Niles moves to hug her again, but this time Martin gets there first._
     **Martin:** Now, Daphne, it's all right.  You're better off without him.  
             That guy was a bum.
     **Daphne:** He was the best thing in my life!
     **Martin:** Oh.  Well, maybe you two weren't meant for each other, you 
             know?  I mean, you're a champagne-and-caviar sort of gal, 
             he's a meat-and-potatoes guy.
     **Daphne:**[_crying at the memory_] Potatoes!
     **Martin:** I'm messing up, too.
      **Niles:** I've got it, Dad.
    
    _He moves a third time, but the doorbell rings._
    
     **Daphne:** I'll get it!
    _She moves away, leaving Niles very frustrated.  She opens the door to 
    Roz._
        **Roz:** Hey, Daphne!
     **Daphne:**[_a cry of pain_] Roz...
        **Roz:** Oh my God, you got dumped! [_hugs her; over her shoulder, 
             to Frasier_] Did you make her answer the door?
    **Frasier:** It's what she does! 
        **Roz:**[_to Daphne_] Oh, it's all right, come on.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry about this.  I guess I'm still at the point where 
             I can't hear his name without crying.
      **Niles:** You hear that, everyone?  No one mention the name "Joe!"
    
    _Daphne starts crying again.  Niles eagerly moves in, but Frasier 
    holds him back and bats his arm.  Roz takes Daphne to her room._
    
    **Frasier:** Brandy, Niles?
      **Niles:** Uh, yes.  Thank you.  Frasier?  I've just made an important 
             decision.  I'm going to tell Daphne how I feel about her.
    **Frasier:** What?
      **Niles:** I'm going to tell her tonight.
    **Frasier:** You're serious about this?
      **Niles:** I'm dead serious.  Maris and I are nowhere near reconciling.  
             I know this is the right decision, because I'm completely 
             calm about it.  Look.
    _He holds out his hand to show that it's steady.  However, the 
    other hand, which is resting on Frasier's African sculpture, 
    shakes violently, rattling the statue._
    
      **Niles:** Perhaps I'll take that brandy.
    **Frasier:** Niles, before you do anything this rash, you should consider 
             it first from all angles.
      **Niles:** I've spent three years considering Daphne from all angles.
    **Frasier:** I'm just not sure this is the right moment for this.
      **Niles:** No, no, if you're trying to rattle me it's not going to 
             work.  I've been rehearsing this for months.  "Daphne, 
             there's something I need to talk to you about.  It's a 
             matter of... Daphne, for a long time now, uh... you and 
             I, we" -- exactly how's the brandy getting here, by St. 
             Bernard?!
    **Frasier:** Niles, I just think that you should consider Daphne's state 
             of mind.  She's still reeling from her breakup with Joe.  
             Listen, why don't you give it one more day?
      **Niles:** A day?
    **Frasier:** A day.  Just one day, please!  You've waited this long, 
             another day won't make a difference.
      **Niles:** All right.
    
    _Roz brings Daphne out._
    
        **Roz:** Now, Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't that good and the sex 
             wasn't that good, what have you really lost here?
    
    _Daphne starts crying again._
    
    **Frasier:** Dr. Roz wades in with the "Gabor approach" to therapy!
        **Roz:** I am taking Daphne out and getting her mind off her troubles.
             Here's your tape. [_puts it on the table_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you, Roz.
     **Daphne:** I want to thank you both for being so supportive.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne, nonsense.  You know, after three years, you're 
             really a member of the family.
    _The phone rings._
     **Daphne:**[_still crying_] I'll get it.
    _She crosses the room to get it.  Roz advances on Frasier, glaring._
    **Frasier:** It's what she does!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    The next morning.  Martin is reading the paper at the table, 
    Frasier is looking through his CD's._
    
     **Martin:** What are the Sonics thinking last night?  If you're two for 
             fifteen from behind the arc, why do you still give it to your 
             two-guard instead of jamming it down to your big man in the 
             paint?
    
    _Pause._
    
    **Frasier:** Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you.
     **Martin:** You know, if you took an interest in sports, I bet you'd end
             up enjoying it.  It's got drama, it's got graceful stuff...
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad, but frankly I'm quite satisfied with the 
             likes of Pavorotti's _Pagliacci_.  You have your big man in 
             the paint, I have mine.
    _The doorbell rings.  Frasier opens the door to Niles, who is holding 
    a large bouquet of flowers against his chest._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Either your boutonniere is way over the top, or you're here 
             to execute last night's plan.
      **Niles:** Look, I know I don't have your total support in this, but... 
             how shall I put this?
    **Frasier:** You don't care?
      **Niles:** If you could work the phrase "rat's ass" into there, you'd 
             have it.  The fact is, I'm tired of being lonely, and it 
             makes no sense going on being lonely when the woman I long 
             for is unattached.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, as I said to you at the time you tried to jump out 
             of the tree house with an umbrella, "I suppose you know what 
             you're doing."
    
    _Martin emerges from the kitchen with a bowl of potato chips._  
    
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles.
      **Niles:** Hey, Dad.
    _The phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:**[_answering_] Hello?  Oh, just a second, please.  Dad, is 
             Daphne in her room?
     **Martin:** Gee, I don't know. [_screaming_] DAPHNE!  HEY, DAPH!  DAPHNE!
    **Frasier:** For God's sake, I can yell! [_into phone_] Would you hold, 
             please?
    
    _Frasier goes to the hallway._
    
     **Martin:** I've been waiting thirty years to do that.
      **Niles:** You're probably wondering what I'm doing with these flowers.
     **Martin:** Well, now that you mention it--
      **Niles:** Well, I'll tell you.  They're for Daphne.  I'm going to tell 
             her how I feel about her.
     **Martin:** Oh, that's great, Niles.
      **Niles:** "That's great?"
     **Martin:** Well, yeah.  You're single now.  She's single.  What's the 
             problem?
      **Niles:**[_laughing_] That's so funny.
     **Martin:** What is?
      **Niles:** That's just not the reaction I expected.  I thought you'd say 
             something more Dad-like, like...
     **Martin:** You're out of your mind?
      **Niles:**[_laughing_] Yes.
     **Martin:** She's never gonna go for it in a million years?
      **Niles:**[_still laughing_] Stop it!
     **Martin:** Someday you're gonna look back on this as the stupidest, most 
             idiotic--
      **Niles:**[_not laughing_] I said stop it, Dad.
    
    _Daphne and Frasier come out.  Niles gets up and coyly hides the 
    flowers behind his back._
    
     **Daphne:** Morning, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, don't you look nice. [_picks up phone_] Hello?  Yes, Rodney, 
             I'm so glad you called!  Yes, I enjoyed meeting you too.  Oh, 
             well, yes, that would be lovely.  I'll see you around four, 
             then.  Bye. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Rodney?
     **Daphne:** Yes, you won't believe this.  Last night, Roz insisted on 
             taking me to this bar she calls "The Sure Thing."
    **Frasier:** How flattering.  They've named a bar after her.
     **Daphne:** She says that whenever she takes a friend there, they always 
             end up meeting someone.  Well, I wasn't there ten minutes 
             when she spun my barstool around and I was face-to-face with 
             this nice-looking man.
     **Martin:** Rodney?
     **Daphne:** Right!  I suppose it's a bit soon for me to be seeing anyone 
             else.  But, if I wait, he might not be available when I'm 
             ready.
      **Niles:** Timing is everything.
     **Daphne:** I can't wait to tell Roz!
    
    _She runs off to the hallway._
    
      **Niles:** "Give it a day, Niles."  I believe that was your brilliant 
             advice?
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Niles, I really am.  I don't know what to say.
      **Niles:**[_dropping the flowers on the table_] Too bad you didn't have 
             that problem last night.
     **Martin:** Don't let it get you down.
      **Niles:** I'm not going to.  I still have a fallback position. [_grabs 
             Frasier's rolodex and starts flipping through it_] I'm going 
             to call Roz and have her take me to that bar tonight!
    **Frasier:** Niles, really -- a singles bar?  Please, you're not thinking
             clearly.  That's not exactly your arena, is it?  Listen, why 
             don't you just give it a day and think it over... [_off Niles's 
             glare_] Here, let me dial that for you.
    _FADE TO:_
    **WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS HER NAME**
    
    _Scene Three -- Granville's
    An upscale singles bar -- piano, bar with stools, tables.  It's sparsely 
    populated.  Roz is sitting at the bar.  Niles comes up behind her, 
    slightly frazzled._
    
      **Niles:** Well, I'm here.  I forgot to gargle, I'm wearing mismatched 
             socks, and I'm so nervous I could wet myself.
        **Roz:** Well, at least we have your opening line down.
      **Niles:** You're going to have to be patient with me, Roz.  This isn't 
             exactly my _milieu_.
        **Roz:** O.K., let's make that lesson number one.  If you're going to 
             use words like "_milieu_ ," you might as well show up here with a 
             sore on your lip and a couple of kids.
      **Niles:** Point well taken.
        **Roz:** Will you sit down and relax? [_he sits next to her_] You're 
             gonna be fine.  There's just a few little rules you need to 
             know.  First, when you introduce yourself, be as casual as 
             possible.  Second, you cannot say enough nice things about her 
             hair.  I know that sounds shallow, but it really works.  And 
             third, hang on her every word -- be fascinated.  Now go.
      **Niles:** What do you mean, "go"?
        **Roz:** It's time.
      **Niles:** I'm not ready.
        **Roz:** Oh, I've thrown a lot of little babies in the water and 
             they've all come up swimming.  Now go.
      **Niles:** No, no, I couldn't possibly, not yet, I need to--
    
    _She spins his barstool around, bringing him face-to-face with an 
    attractive blond woman (Adelle)._
    
      **Niles:** Hello.
     **Adelle:** Hello.
      **Niles:** Hope I'm not bothering you.
     **Adelle:** No, not at all.  I'm Adelle.
      **Niles:** Niles. [_shakes her hand_] So, "Adelle"... is that with one 
             "l" or two?
     **Adelle:** Two.
      **Niles:**[_fascinated_] _Really?_
    
    _He props an elbow up on the bar and rests his head on his hand.  
    Roz smiles, thinking, "I've thrown him off the roof and he's 
    flying!"
    
    END OF ACT ONE
    
    ACT TWO_
    
    **STAREMASTER**
    
    _Scene Four -- Frasier's Apartment
    It's evening.  Frasier and Eddie are seated opposite each other at 
    the dinner table, having a stare-down contest.  Martin comes out._
    
     **Martin:** You're wasting your time.
    **Frasier:** No, I'm not.  
     **Martin:** You're not gonna win.
    **Frasier:** It's time he learned what it's like to be stared at all 
             the time.  Bring it on, Buster, you got _nothing_.  You can't 
             touch me, I'm -- Gaah! [_breaks away, clutching his eyes_] 
             It's like his eyes turned into sorcerer's pinwheels and 
             started spinning!
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
     **Martin:** Just shake hands and say "good fight."
    _Frasier considers doing it for a second, then decides not.  
    Martin opens the door to Niles and Adelle, dressed for an 
    evening out._
    
     **Martin:** Oh, hi, Niles!  Come on in.
      **Niles:** Dad, this is Adelle Childs -- my father Martin.
     **Martin:** Nice to meet you. [_shakes her hand_]
      **Niles:** And this is my brother, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** It's so nice to finally meet you.
     **Adelle:** Nice to meet you.
      **Niles:** Are you all right?  Your eyes look funny.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm fine, it's just -- oh, here are your tickets. [_gives 
             them to Niles_]
      **Niles:** Thank you.
    **Frasier:** Say, have you got time for a coffee before you go?
     **Adelle:** That'd be nice.
    **Frasier:** Splendid!  Gives me a chance to debut my Limoges coffee set -- 
             a series of six unique cups, each one representing a different 
             wife of Henry VIII.  My antique dealer just found an "Anne of 
             Cleves" to complete the set!
    
    _Frasier goes to the kitchen._
    
     **Martin:** He loves to rub it in.  I'm still looking for a "Wilma" to 
             complete my juice glass set.
      **Niles:** I'll lend you a hand. [_to Adelle_] Excuse me.
    _In the kitchen, Niles comes in to have a man-to-man with Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** So, what do you think?
    **Frasier:** She seems very nice.
      **Niles:** She's fabulous.  I know it's only been three dates, but I 
             feel as though I've been rescued.  I no longer have to worry 
             about becoming one of those pitiful losers embittered by a 
             failed marriage, leading a lonely pathetic life of... 
             [_off Frasier's withering look_] fulfillment and good times!
    **Frasier:** Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that?
    
    _They come out into the living room._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, coffee will be ready in a moment.
     **Adelle:** So what were you two whispering about?
    
    _The doorbell rings._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, nothing -- just how, whenever you think you have your life 
             figured out, something unexpected happens.
    
    _He opens the door to Daphne._
    
     **Daphne:** Sorry, forgot my keys.  Hello, all.  Oh, everyone, this is 
             Rodney Banks.
    _In steps a man who is Niles's Doppleganger -- same height, same figure, 
    same haircut, same neat suit, same rigid posture -- the sole difference 
    is that his hair is brown._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Niles Crane.
      **Niles:** How do you do?
     **Rodney:** The pleasure is mine.
    _They shake hands.  In a perfect mirror of each other, they then take 
    out handkerchiefs and wipe their palms.  Frasier and Martin stare.  
    Daphne, standing in the middle, doesn't seem to notice._
    
     **Rodney:** Flu season.
      **Niles:** Can't be too careful.
     **Daphne:** Oh, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, and his father Martin.  And...
      **Niles:** This is Adelle Childs.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
     **Adelle:** Hello.
     **Daphne:** Well, we've just had the most wonderful day at the marina.
     **Martin:** Oh, you get a boat?
     **Rodney:** Actually, no.  I have an inner-ear curvature that makes 
             me prone to motion sickness. [_Martin looks at Frasier,  
             incredulous_] But there's a charming bistro there that 
             serves the most exquisite--
    _A phone rings.  Mirroring each other again, Niles and Rodney take out 
    cell phones and flip them open._
    
      **Niles:** Not me.
     **Rodney:** Not me.
    
    _It's the cordless phone.  Martin picks it up._
    
     **Martin:** Hello?  Oh, I can't talk right now, Duke.  I'm in the 
             Twilight Zone. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** Would, uh, you like a coffee?
     **Daphne:** Oh yes, that would be lovely.
     **Martin:** I'll give you a hand, Frasier!
    
    _Martin gets up and follows Frasier into the kitchen.  
    As soon as they make it in:_
    
    **Frasier/**Martin:**** What the hell was that?!
    
    **Frasier:** I think maybe we should put a little red mark on the real 
             Niles so we can tell them apart!
     **Martin:** Niles must be going nuts!
    
    _Niles comes in._
    
      **Niles:** Can I lend you a hand?
     **Martin:** Oh no, that's fine, Niles. [_Niles turns to go_] Oh, wait, wait 
             a minute!  So, uh... what do you think of Rodney?
      **Niles:** Well, so far I'm not impressed.  Bit of a pretentious fop, 
             wouldn't you say?
     **Martin:** He doesn't, uh, remind you of anyone?
      **Niles:** Remind me of anyone...
    
    _Rodney comes in._
    
     **Rodney:** So sorry, but about my coffee?  I neglected to mention that 
             I like my milk steamed, with just a dollop of foam, such as 
             might give the impression of a cumulus cloud reflected in a 
             still pond.
      **Niles:** Consider it done.
    
    _Rodney smiles and leaves._
    
      **Niles:** I want to kill myself!
    
    _Frasier and Martin laugh._
    
     **Martin:** Come on, Niles, it's funny!
      **Niles:** No!  It's not remotely funny!  Frasier talked me out of 
             approaching Daphne on the same night she fell for that man!
    **Frasier:** You can't possibly be mad at me!
      **Niles:** No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful. [_grabs a kitchen knife_] 
             Come here, let me show you how grateful I am!
     **Martin:**[_getting in his way_] Niles, calm down!
    
    _Daphne comes in to get the sugar bowl and cream pitcher._
    
     **Daphne:** Isn't Rodney just great? [_everyone agrees_] You know, I think 
             it was the moment I broke up with Joe that I heard a voice 
             saying, "Daphne, it's time you went for a completely new type 
             of man."
    
    _Daphne leaves.  Niles grabs a spatula._
    
      **Niles:** You're a dead man!
    
    _Martin gets in his way again._
    
    **Frasier:** Let's serve our guests their coffee!
    
    _Frasier and Martin carry cups of coffee out to the living room._
    
    **Frasier:** Here we are, coffee.  Milk's on its way, Niles is still 
             steaming.
     **Rodney:** Nothing smells quite so heavenly as a freshly brewed cup of 
             coffee.  Well, perhaps one thing does.
    
    _He smells Daphne's hair._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, stop that! [_laughing_] He just loves to smell my hair!
    
    _There's a crash from the kitchen.  Frasier winces.  Martin thinks, 
    "Uh-Oh."_
    
    **Frasier:**[_stricken_] Anne Boleyn?
      **Niles:**[_o.s._] Catherine of Aragon.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Five -- Cafe Nervosa
    Niles is sitting at a table with his back to the door.  Frasier comes 
    in.  Niles notices him, then looks away._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.  You don't take my calls, you 
             ignore me.  For God's sake, it's the behavior of a pouting 
             adolescent. [_sits down_] Are you quite finished now? [_realizes_] 
             You put gum on my chair, didn't you? 
      **Niles:** Yep.
    **Frasier:**[_removing the gum_] Niles, listen: I am terribly sorry if I 
             steered you wrong.  But just think about it.  You do have a 
             wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you?
      **Niles:** Yes, I--I suppose I do.
    **Frasier:** And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she?
      **Niles:**[_perking up_] Yes. [_chuckles_] Yes, she does.
    **Frasier:** Well, then, if you've ever taken any of my advice before, 
             take this: Adelle may very well be the path to your happiness.
    
    _No sooner are the words out of his mouth than Adelle comes into 
    the caf e, on the arm of Rodney.  They sit in a corner booth together.  
    Niles doesn't see them._
    
    **Frasier:** But let's say I'm wrong...
      **Niles:** But-but you're not wrong.  Adelle is a wonderful, affectionate 
             woman.
    
    _Frasier chuckles nervously._
    
      **Niles:** She's clearly drawn to a man of my type.
    **Frasier:** Mmm.
      **Niles:** Just thinking about her lifts my spirits.  Frasier... thank 
             you.
    **Frasier:** Niles, uh... [_sighs_] look.
    
    _Niles turns and looks.  He turns back to Frasier with outrage._
    
      **Niles:** I don't believe it!  The betrayal!  No one treats Daphne like 
             that!
    
    _He rises angrily to his feet.  Frasier restrains him._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Whatever you do, do not engage him in a physical 
             fight.  The whole thing would just look too weird!
    
    _Niles steps forward._
    
      **Niles:** Hello, Adelle.
    
    _They look up._
    
     **Adelle:**[_startled_] Oh no.
     **Rodney:** I know this may look a tad incriminating, but the truth is--
      **Niles:** Oh, spare me, you ludicrous popinjay.  I know exactly what's 
             going on here, I saw the whole thing from my table.
     **Adelle:** I was going to call you!  You see, Rodney and I... I'm sorry.
      **Niles:** So am I, Adelle.  But I'm mainly sorry for Daphne.  How do 
             you intend to handle that small matter?
     **Rodney:** I was planning on telling her this evening at Granville's.  
             We're meeting for drinks.
      **Niles:** Granville's... why don't you do her a favor?  Let me tell her.  
             It might be better coming from a friend.
     **Rodney:** Yes, perhaps you're right.  Please tell her that I'm sorry.  
             Sometimes, when a man meets the woman that he's meant to be 
             with, [_clasps Adelle's hand affectionately_] there's nothing 
             he can do to resist it.  I hope Daphne understands that.
      **Niles:** I hope she understands it too.
    
    _Niles leaves the Caf e.  Frasier steps forward._
    
    **Frasier:** Rodney... [_growling_] Adelle.  
    
    _He gets his coat to leave, but turns back._
    **Frasier:** You know, there's just one thing I'd like to ask you, Rodney:
             do you have an older brother?
     **Rodney:** As a matter of fact, I do.  He's always been the pride of 
             the family -- handsome, successful, brilliant.  I've always 
             been rather jealous of him.
    **Frasier:** Spooky.
    
    _He leaves.  Rodney and Adelle look somewhat puzzled.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six -- Granville's
    That evening.  Daphne is sitting at the bar with a glass of red wine.  
    Niles comes in._
    
      **Niles:** Evening, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** You don't seem surprised to see me.
     **Daphne:** I was running late, so I called Rodney on his cell phone.  
             He told me everything.
      **Niles:** Oh.  I'm sorry.
     **Daphne:** I'm sorry for you, too. [_raising her glass_] Join me in a 
             little sorrow-drowning?
      **Niles:** I believe I will. [_to bartender_] One more of these, please. 
             [_the bartender pours him a glass of wine_] Thank you. [_to 
             Daphne_] Well, I can't really blame Adelle.  Rodney's that 
             sort of man that women seem to go for.
     **Daphne:**[_sadly_] Yes, he is.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.
     **Daphne:** You didn't.  I guess I'm just in more of a mood to hear about 
             his negative qualities right now.
      **Niles:** Well, he's a bit of a know-it-all, a bit fussy...
     **Daphne:** Has to have everything just so, he's nuts about cleanliness, 
             then there's his clothes, his precious shoes--
      **Niles:** I don't like this road we're on.  I mean, wouldn't it be 
             better if we discussed what's in our futures?
     **Daphne:** I suppose so.  I'll tell you one thing.  After the run I've 
             had, I pity the next man I date.  I'd probably rip him to 
             shreds.
      **Niles:** What about the man after that?
     **Daphne:** Men can be such an unfeeling lot.  Look at Rodney -- the moment 
             he heard I'd just broken up with someone, he moved right in 
             for the kill.  Is that how all men are?
      **Niles:** No, not all men.
     **Daphne:** Of course they aren't.  You're not.  You're kind, 
             sensitive -- you ask me, you were too good for that Adelle.
      **Niles:** Thank you, Daphne.  You know, the truth is my heart was never 
             really in that relationship.
     **Daphne:** I thought it might not be.
      **Niles:** There was someone else who was too much on my mind.
     **Daphne:** I had a feeling, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** You did?
     **Daphne:** Yes.  As long as you still have feelings for your wife, you 
             know you can't be involved with anyone else.  It makes sense 
             to me -- I know I'd never get involved with a man who was 
             separated.
      **Niles:** Even if he'd worshipped you from the day he laid eyes on you?
     **Daphne:** And don't think that's not just how they put it, too! 
             [_laughs_] No, I think I need to do a bit of separating 
             myself -- from Joe, I mean.  Yes, I'll wait a good long time 
             before I do anymore dating.
      **Niles:** Well, I'm glad to hear that.
     **Daphne:**[_chuckling_] You know, it's funny when you think about it -- 
             the two of us coming to this same singles bar this week?  
             Why, this was the very stool I was on when I met Rodney.
      **Niles:** I was sitting here when I met Adelle. [_she chuckles again_] 
             What?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I was just thinking.  If it'd been a different time in 
             both our lives, we might actually have met.  How do you 
             suppose that would have gone?
      **Niles:** What, our conversation?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, come on!  Just for fun -- we could both use a smile.
      **Niles:** Well, uh... first I would have said, "Is this seat taken?"  
             And you would have said, "no."  You would have said, "my name 
             is Daphne," and I would have said "my name is Niles."  And 
             then I would have said... "What are you doing for the rest of 
             your life?"
     **Daphne:**[_laughing_] You always know just what to say. [_then, as a 
             friend would say it_] Oh, I love you, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** I love you too, Daphne.
