He turns round and shows them to Eddie who buries his head under the nearest pillow.  Martin decides the best answer is to just throw them into the cardboard box with the rest of the junk.  However just to make sure, Eddie goes into the box, pulls them out and proceeds to rip them to shreds. _   * * *  ## Guest Appearances    **Guest Starring** ALAN WILDER as Leo MICHAEL McFALL as Messenger LUCK HARI as Waitress GERRY GIBSON as Tom   * * *  ## Synopsis {mike lee}    As Frasier finishes his show, a going-away party is being thrown in the hallway for a retiring employee.  Frasier says he doesn't want to go out, because he'll be expected to hug the guy.  Roz scolds him for his aversion to hugging; she says she even read somewhere that physical contact extends lifespans.  \"Well, in that case,\" Frasier quips, \"you'll outlive Styrofoam.\"  She pushes him out into the hall, where he reluctantly hugs the retiree.  Frasier meets Niles at the Cafe, and compliments him on his tie. Niles proudly says that Maris gave it to him as a gift--she had it made from her \"fat pants\" when she had her obesity scare.  Frasier wonders if wearing a gift from Maris will make Niles melancholy.  Niles confidently says he will be reuniting with Maris soon; he called her to ask if she'd go into couples' therapy with him, and she said \"I'll think about it.\"  Then a courier comes in and hands Niles an envelope: divorce papers. He offers his condolences, but also compliments Niles's tie.  Daphne sneaks a box of stuff towards the door, but runs into Martin returning with Eddie.  He's annoyed because an old lady they keep running into knitted Eddie a ridiculous tartan sweater that he had to put on just to please her.  Daphne says at least she didn't knit anything for Martin--who then produces an identical hat.  Noticing the box, he realizes Daphne is throwing away all his old stuff.  Daphne says it's useless junk.  Frasier and Niles come back.  Also noticing the box, they root through it and find an old journal with their mother's name on it. Frasier flips through it and realizes it's about them as children. Among other observations, their mother records that \"Frasier seems intimidated by physical contact,\" and \"Niles is obsessively neat and easily cowed by females.\"  Frasier wonders if his aversion to hugging is a deep-seated condition.  Niles is stung by his mother's words; Frasier suggests that he has a chance to assert himself by signing the divorce papers.  Niles says there's a problem: he already sent them back (unsigned), along with a groveling note begging Maris to take him back.  Niles says it's not too late--it's Maris's spa day, so all the servants are playing hookey.  They can sneak into the house and steal the papers back.  _END OF ACT ONE  ACT TWO_  ****THANK GOD IT WASN'T SOUP NIGHT****  Frasier and Niles enter the drawing room of the mansion; Frasier is surprised Maris hasn't changed the locks.  Niles finds the envelope on the coffee table.  As they are about to leave, two snarling German Shepherds appear outside the door.  Niles greets them fondly, but they snap at him. \"She didn't change the locks,\" Niles realizes, \"she changed the dogs!\"  They are trapped.  Niles gets a brainstorm: it's Swedish Meatball Night--they can slip a handful of Maris's relaxant pills into the meat and feed them to the dogs from the upstairs balcony.  Niles runs upstairs to the medicine cabinet while Frasier runs to the kitchen. ",

After several meatballs plunk into the fountain, Frasier yells up at Niles to stop trying to throw.  \"You can drop straight, can't you?!\" Niles does, and the dogs eat it up.  As they wait for the pills to take effect, Frasier notices a large painting of Maris on the wall (looking at the camera, so we can't see it).  He asks if it's recent.  Niles says no, he and Maris had it done a few years ago.  Frasier says Niles isn't in the picture--just Maris standing next to a large tree.  Niles is outraged--she's had him painted out!  Frasier gently tells him to check the face of the skunk in the bushes.  Niles bitterly admits that it's only right for him to be depicted as a laughingstock in that house; just look around, the room is a \"monument to his spinelessness,\" full of gifts he gave Maris to \"apologize\" for things--like a golden candelabra for his attempts to grow a mustache.  Frasier says, \"I think you owe us all a candelabra for that one!\"  Well, Niles decides, no more.  He takes a pen, signs the divorce papers, and drops them back on the coffee table (after removing his groveling note).  Frasier asks him if he's sure.  Niles says he is. Then the dogs nod off.  Frasier suggests they take the back door out, just to be safe.  Niles says no, one last time he wants to walk out of the house with his head held high.  Frasier bolts out the back door anyway; Niles says, \"Right behind you!\"  Martin takes his shaving-cream warmer from the box and goes into the powder room to plug it in, to show Daphne how useful his \"junk\" is. They just have to wait five minutes.  Frasier and Niles come back, telling Martin and Daphne the news; Niles is on the road to divorce.  They offer their support; Martin says that in the long run, Niles will be much happier, \"I know I will!\"  Frasier suggests they all go out for a celebratory dinner. Martin and Daphne go to their rooms to change.  Frasier tells Niles it's finally over--if he wants, he never has to see Maris again.  Niles says he could barely see her when she was standing right in front of him.  They laugh, but then Niles starts hyperventilating--he's just ended his marriage!  Frasier rushes to reassure him it was the right decision.  To help, he rereads the entry in their mother's journal.  But as he reads on, he realizes that it's really a scientific journal, and \"Frasier and Niles\" were their mother's two favorite lab rats!  The last entry chronicles her sadness as \"Frasier\" passes away, comforted by the fact that she's about to give birth to her firstborn child.  Now Niles has a full-blown panic attack. ",
