[_to Frasier:_] You breaking up with your wife over a pair of opera glasses. [_to Niles:_] And you looking down your nose at me the entire time you were showing off your \"posh flat.\"  Well, to be honest, mate, I don't think there's anything remotely special about your bathrooms. [_Frasier is offended; to the girls:_] And you two women, flirting shamelessly with me right in front of your husbands. [_to Roz:_] You having just reconciled with Frasier, [_to Daphne:_] and you carrying Niles's baby. Well, I pity your child, Daphne.  And I pity any good Manchester girl that comes here to this vile coffee- swilling Sodom and lets it change her like it's changed you.",
