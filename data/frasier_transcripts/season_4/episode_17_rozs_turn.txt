    **GUYS AND DOLLS**
    
    _Act One. 
    
    Scene One - Frasier's apartment.
    Frasier opens the door to Niles._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but I need your help. 
    **Frasier:** Of course.  Sherry?
      **Niles:** Please.  As you know, ever since I moved into the Montana
             I've been angling to meet our most famous tenant: Esmeralda
             Bing, the Walnut Queen.  Well, I finally cornered her in the
             ornamental garden, by the wishing well, and I felt very 
             pleased with myself - that is until the Walnut Queen invited
             me to a ball.  Now I have a problem.
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Yes, your life has become an operetta.
      **Niles:**[_smiles at the quip_] No, it's a charity ball.  And when I 
             say invited, I mean she let me buy a table for ten at five
             thousand dollars.  I've until Sunday to sell eight five 
             hundred dollar tickets...
    **Frasier:**[_picking up cheque book:_] Say no more.  It's a bit steep, 
             but if it's for charity...
      **Niles:** Thank you Frasier, it is a very worthy cause.
    **Frasier:** Alright, who should I make this out to?
      **Niles:**[_Frasier writes as Niles speaks_] The Esmeralda... Bing...
             International... Doll Museum.
    
    _Frasier puts his cheque book away and rips the cheque up._
    
    **Frasier:** You do have a problem!
      **Niles:** I thought you prided yourself on supporting the arts!
    **Frasier:** The arts, Niles, not the crafts!
    
    _At this point Daphne & Martin come out the bedroom and into the main 
    room, arguing as usual._
    
     **Martin:** I told you, I can't do it now.  Sherry's taking me out for 
             our third-month anniversary, and I've got to get a new sport
             coat.
     **Daphne:** You cannot skip your exercises again - you skipped them
             yesterday. 
     **Martin:** This is the only time Sherry can go shopping with me and I
             can't go without her.  There isn't a woman alive with her
             fashion sense! 
      **Niles:**[_aside to Frasier:_] Carmen Miranda having passed on!
     **Daphne:** I should think having a lady friend would make you exercise
             more, not less.  I don't mean to be indelicate, but a man in
             your condition who wants to enjoy certain, shall we say, 
             indoor sports, should take steps to make sure that cranky old
             Mr. Hip doesn't, shall we say, let down the team, if you get
             my meaning?
     **Martin:** Don't you worry about me.  I may not be the rookie of the 
             year any more but I can still move around the bases!
    _Martin opens the door to leave and bumps into Roz who is standing 
    there._
        **Roz:** Oh hey, Martin.
      **Niles:**[_aside to Frasier:_] Oh look, a scout from the majors.
     **Martin:** I'll see you later, I gotta run. [_leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, this is a surprise.
        **Roz:**[_happy:_] Big news.  Gertie Oldson is leaving the station.
     **Daphne:** What, from "Gertie's Grotbag"?  I love that show.
    **Frasier:** Oh please, that homily-spouting Hausfrau?  It's the most 
             embarrassing thing on the air.  So, she finally got canned, 
             eh?
        **Roz:** No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.
    **Frasier:**[_chokes on his sherry, then:_] Well, good news for Gertie 
             and for the many atheists who will welcome this new proof 
             of their theory. 
        **Roz:** Anyway, they're auditioning people for her time slot and... 
             I'm going to go for it.
    **Frasier:** What do you mean - your own show?
     **Daphne:** Roz, that's exciting.
      **Niles:**[_slyly:_] And what better way to celebrate an exciting new 
             career move than spending this Sunday at a swanky society 
             ball? [_takes out tickets_]
    **Frasier:** Drop it, Niles!  Of course, this comes as a little surprise.
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I never knew you were interested in getting your own 
             show.
        **Roz:** Well, it's the whole reason I got into radio.  I mean, I had 
             my own show in college and when I started working at the 
             station I kinda got stuck on the producing side.
    **Frasier:** What kind of show did you have in mind?
        **Roz:** I thought I'd talk about stuff I know: the singles life in 
             Seattle, dating, fashion, where to meet available men...
      **Niles:** Well, if you're looking for an event which will be crawling 
             with attractive single men, [_takes tickets out_] this 
             particular ga...
    **Frasier:**[_angry:_] Niles! 
        **Roz:** Anyway Frasier, I hope that you'll support me on this.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'd hate to lose you, but of course I'll support you.
        **Roz:**[_happy:_] Oh thank you, Frasier, you're the best.
    **Frasier:**[_modest:_] Well...
        **Roz:** Listen, as long as I've got you all here - I'm putting 
             together an audition and I could use people to pretend to be 
             callers...
    **Frasier:**[_happily:_] We'd be glad to help. 
     **Daphne:** Sounds like fun.
        **Roz:** Alright, I'll come back tonight.  Oh and Daphne, I need at 
             least one spicy call.  Could you pretend to be a woman who
             doesn't believe in sex without love, but just feels so horny 
             sometimes she wants to jump anything in pants?
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastic:_] Well, I'll try.  And while I'm at it, I'll see 
             if I can fake a British accent!
    
    _Roz and Daphne laugh. So does Niles, but out of Daphne's sight 
    his knees wobble, and he clutches onto his brother.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **ANY PORT MANTEAU
    IN A STORM**
    
    _Scene Two - Apartment
    Later that night: Roz, Niles, Daphne and Frasier are sitting around 
    the dining room table.  Niles is holding a microphone connected to 
    a tape recorder.  Roz begins her audition tape._
    
        **Roz:**[_into microphone:_] Good afternoon, Seattle.  I'm Roz Doyle 
             and this is "Love Matters."  Today we're chatting with 
             merchant seaman Steve Barron, from Billingham.  Tell me 
             Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date?
    **Frasier:**[_normal posh voice:_] When my shipmates and I pull into port 
             after several weeks at sea...
        **Roz:** Cut! [_stops tape:_] Sorry Frasier, but you don't sound like a 
             merchant seamen.
    **Frasier:** Oh, let's try again, alright?
        **Roz:**[_starts tape:_] So, Steve, what do you look for in an ideal 
             date?
    **Frasier:**[_salty voice:_] When my shipmates and I pull into port 
             after several weeks at sea, the first thing we do is... 
      **Niles:**[_taking the mike, salty voice:_] ...head for the antique sale!
    
    _He laughs.  Roz turns off the tape._
    
    **Frasier:** Fine, smarty pants.  Well, you play Steve then.
        **Roz:** Never mind, let's just go on to my next idea.  Daphne?  OK, 
             you be the girlfriend of a couple who wants to spice things 
             up in the bedroom.  Niles, will you be her boyfriend?
      **Niles:**[_quickly:_] Yes. 
        **Roz:** OK. [_starts tape:_] I'm here with Fred and Patty.  Tell me, 
             you two, what made you think that your sex life needs a 
             little jump start?
     **Daphne:** It's all his fault.  He just seems to have lost interest in 
             me.  I've done everything I can to entice him.  I've... 
             served dinner wearing nothing but high heels and an apron; 
             I've called him at the office and talked dirty; and last 
             night when he came home I was lying in bed wearing a whipped 
             cream teddy! But, [_angry:_] did he care?  No!
        **Roz:** And none of this turns you on, Fred?
    _Niles cannot answer.  He just stares into nothingness, reliving their 
    imaginary past experiences.  Roz gets impatient._
    
        **Roz:** Fred? 
      **Niles:**[_comes out of trance:_] That's nothing, you should hear the 
             other things that don't turn me on!  Tell me about it, Patty.
        **Roz:** Let's cut to the chase.  Patty, men are like fish: when you 
             first hook 'em they wriggle around like crazy, but once you 
             finally reel them in they just lie there with that glassy 
             look. 
      **Niles:** That's terrible advice.
        **Roz:** No, it isn't.
      **Niles:** Yes, it is, you have no idea how Fred really feels about 
             Daphne... Patsy.
     **Daphne:** Patty.
      **Niles:** Patty!
        **Roz:** This is pointless.
    **Frasier:** No, Roz, you're doing just fine. 
        **Roz:**[_angry:_] No, I was terrible!  I wasn't helpful, I wasn't 
             smart... I wasn't even sassy!
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps not sassy but you were simply saucy, that 
             borders on sassy. 
    
    _Frasier and Roz enters the kitchen as Martin enters the living room 
    from the front door._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello, Mr. Crane.  How was your romantic evening with Sherry?
     **Martin:** Oh, it was fine. [_laughs, but:_] Er, hey Daph', how about 
             getting that exercise mat out, we'll do some stretches, eh?
     **Daphne:** Can't right now, I'm helping Roz with her audition tape.
     **Martin:**[_impatient:_] Well, how long's it going to take?
     **Daphne:** What are you so eager for? [_realising:_] Oh, I get the 
             picture.  Not too limber with Sherry this evening, were we?  
             Two hips but no hooray? [_laughs_]
     **Martin:** Very funny!  Well, you haven't exactly been burning it up in 
             the romance department either.
     **Daphne:**[_injured_] What do you know about my love life?
    
    _At this moment Niles accidentally slips on the play button._
    
     **Daphne:**[_on tape:_] I was lying in bed wearing a whipped cream teddy. 
             But did he care... 
    
    _Niles switches it off with sorrowful gestures as Daphne looks 
    embarrassed to a confused Martin.  
    
    Reset to: Kitchen
    Meanwhile, Frasier is consoling Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** It takes some time to get the hang of it at first.  But I 
             mean, you should have heard my audition tape! [_laughs_] I was 
             so inept it was incredible.
        **Roz:**[_remembering:_] That's true! 
    **Frasier:** Oh.  Oh, you heard it?  Well, then you see that... [_mutters_]
        **Roz:**[_laughing:_] There was a bootleg floating around the station 
             for months! 
    **Frasier:** Yes, well fine, so you get my point then...
        **Roz:** People still play it at parties!
    **Frasier:**[_angry:_] Alright, Roz. 
    _Reset to: Living Room
    Roz and Frasier enter as Martin is sitting on his Barcalounger._
    
     **Martin:** So, hey Roz, I hear you're trying out for a new job?
        **Roz:** Yes, as a matter of fact I am.  And you can really help me 
             with my demo.
     **Martin:** What do I do?
        **Roz:** I just want an honest answer.  I want to talk to you about 
             first dates.
     **Martin:** OK.
      **Niles:**[_laughs:_] Are you sure dad's the best candidate for this 
             particular subject? [_Frasier laughs with him_]
     **Martin:**[_easily:_] Quick survey: how many Crane men here with a 
             girlfriend? 
    
    _Martin raises his hand; Frasier and Niles stop laughing._
    
     **Martin:** No, no, keep 'em up while I count. 
    **Frasier:**[_backing up:_] Alright!
        **Roz:** Great.  OK Frasier, start the tape. [_he does; into it:_] 
             Alright, we're here with Martin and we're talking about 
             first dates.  Martin, tell me some of the tricks you use to 
             impress women.
     **Martin:**[_modest:_] Hmmm, well I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz, but I 
             really don't know any tricks.  I mean, if a woman agreed to 
             go out with me, I'd er, well, I'm not there to impress her 
             or to play cool.  I'm there because I want to know her; er, 
             what she thinks; er, what she likes, so that if I'm lucky 
             enough to get another date I can plan something that I know 
             she'd like to do.  I guess I'm still old-fashioned or 
             something, but I think you should treat a woman like a queen. 
    _Daphne and Roz look at each other and give a sigh of wonder, hope and 
    freshness._
    
     **Martin:**[_to kids:_] Bow to the master, boys, bow to the master. 
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - KACL
    Later that week Frasier and Bulldog are in the foyer outside the 
    manager's office.  Bulldog is there and notices Bebe who has just 
    walked in with a crowd._
    
    **Bulldog:** Hey, Bebe!
       **Bebe:** Bulldog Briscoe, my absolute favourite client.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Bebe.
       **Bebe:** And Frasier Crane - alert the judges, we have a tie!
    **Frasier:** Oh my goodness, what a flock.  These all yours?
       **Bebe:** Yes.  The minute I heard about the auditions I piled all my 
             hottest new discoveries into the van.
    **Frasier:** You brought them in a van?
       **Bebe:** I call it my "Bebe Stars Of Tomorrow Tour." [_to flock:_] 
             People, I want you to meet Frasier Crane.
    **Frasier:** Hello.
       **Bebe:**[_selling him:_] The most caring and kindest client I've ever 
             had.  Frasier, this is Professor Pete, the human 
             encyclopedia.  Ask him anything, he can't be stopped. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, alright.  Explain Freud's theory of the superego.
       **Pete:**[_as if reading textbook:_] Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist, 
             was born in Vienna. [_stops_]
    **Frasier:**[_confused:_] That's not what I asked.
       **Pete:** He believed dreams had secret meanings. [_stops_]
       **Bebe:**[_covering up:_] He just pulls it out of the air.  But, if 
             it's a raucous political debate you want, meet newlyweds 
             Hank and Hannah Finch.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Hank.
       **Bebe:**[_selling them:_] He's a right-wing Baptist preacher, she's a 
             fun-loving bisexual!  Conflicts?  You bet!  Have you ever 
             seen such talent?
    **Frasier:**[_laughs:_] Well..
       **Bebe:**[_takes Frasier aside:_] Ugh, they're pathetic! 
    _At this moment Roz bursts out of the manager's office with excitement. 
    She rushes over to Frasier._
    
        **Roz:**[_excited:_] It went really well! 
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, I'm so excited for you. 
        **Roz:** You know what he actually said?  At this moment I am the 
             candidate to beat.
    **Frasier:** Oh congratulations, Roz...
        **Roz:** OK, I'm going to get set up for the show, I'm so excited. 
             [_exits_]
    **Frasier:**[_half-heartedly:_] OK. 
       **Bebe:** Well, ra-ra for little Roz. 
    **Frasier:** Yes well, I'm really thrilled for her, I am, but... [_pauses:_] 
             God knows where I'm going to find another producer.  I feel 
             so in sync with her.
       **Bebe:** You know, Hank Finch produced hygiene films in the army.
    **Frasier:** No, Bebe, I don't think so.  Ah, I'm not proud to admit this, 
             but there's a small part of me that hopes she won't get the 
             job.  God, I feel guilty just saying that.
       **Bebe:**[_pleased:_] You're so good, everything makes you feel guilty. 
             I'm so proud to represent you.  You're like a modern day... 
             what's his name? [_to Pete:_] Pete, famous German doctor - 
             built a hospital in Africa, Albert something?
       **Pete:** Hang on.
    **Frasier:**[_jumping to it:_] Schweitzer.
       **Pete:**[_positive:_] No.
    
    _As Pete fiddles with this "problem," Bebe and Frasier look at each 
    other in disgust.
    
    End Of Act One._ [Time: 11:08]
    
    _Act Two. 
    
    Scene One - KACL
    Frasier is just finishing his radio show._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on air:_] And that is it for our show today.  But before 
             I sign off, this final note to Carla who called us earlier 
             from the planet "Fripton."  The technical term for your 
             condition, which eluded me earlier, is "Schizophrenoform 
             Disorder." [_off air:_] Or in layman's terms...
    
    _Frasier burbles his lips with his finger like a madman.  As Roz 
    enters the booth, she notices a gathering outside._
    
        **Roz:** Hey, what's going on out here?
    **Frasier:** Good Lord, is it someone's birthday?
    **Bulldog:**[_enters:_] Hey Roz, I hate to be the one to break it to you, 
             but Brenda from the newsroom got the job.
        **Roz:** Brenda?
    **Frasier:**[_unhappy for her:_] Oh, Roz.
    **Bulldog:** It's total BS.  Listen, er, if you need a little comforting 
             later... [_shouts and runs off:_] Hey Brenda, alright! [_comes 
             back:_] I'm there for you. [_leaves to Brenda_]
    **Frasier:** Roz, I'm so sorry.
        **Roz:**[_covering up:_] Oh hell, I'll be OK.  Guess I better go 
             congratulate the winner.
    **Frasier:** Right.
    _Frasier goes into the KACL corridor as Roz exits.  He spots Bebe._
    
    **Frasier:** Bebe, did you hear what happened to Roz?
       **Bebe:**[_delighted:_] Yes, no need to thank me, darling.
    **Frasier:**[_confused:_] What are you talking about?
       **Bebe:** I spoke to the station manager - I told him just how you'd
             feel if he gave Roz the job.
    **Frasier:**[_angry:_] You did what?! [_paranoid:_] In here.
    
    _Frasier and Bebe enter the booth._
    
       **Bebe:** I said that Frasier Crane wasn't about to work for a station 
             that would steal his producer away.  A bluff, of course, but 
             he crumbled like a matzo.
    **Frasier:** Oh, how could you?!  I told you that I didn't want to lose 
             Roz, but I didn't mean for you to sabotage her!
       **Bebe:** You didn't?  Oh no, what a horrible misunderstanding. 
             [_pauses:_] Wink! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** I mean it!
       **Bebe:** Oh, I see.  So when you said in that off-handed way that you 
             hoped Roz wouldn't get the job... I totally misinterpreted 
             you. [_pauses:_] Wink! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Will you stop winking!  My God, I could never want such a 
             thing!  There's got to be some way I can still reverse this! 
    
    _At this moment Roz enters the booth._
    
        **Roz:**[_sarcastically:_] Oh that was fun, I got to watch Brenda sign 
             her new contract! 
       **Bebe:** Roz, I think what they did to you is monstrous. [_Frasier 
             can't believe her lies_] I wish I could stay here and console 
             you, but my people are waiting for me in the van.  I hope 
             someone cracked a window! [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Listen Roz, this is something we need to talk about...
        **Roz:** Oh Frasier, I know what you're going to say: that I tried my 
             best, that I deserved it.  I'm fine with this, really.  Yeah, 
             I gave it a shot, that's what counts.  I didn't get it.  
             It's not like.... [_bursting into tears:_] my life is over!
    _Roz, overridden in tears, takes refuge in Frasier's chest.  Some time 
    later she manages to get herself together and pulls away, still upset._
        **Roz:**[_upset:_] Oh look at me, I'm so busy feeling sorry for myself 
             I haven't even thanked you for all your help. 
    **Frasier:**[_troubled:_] That's not necessary. 
        **Roz:** Oh, it is!  Look how close you helped me get, it's because 
             of you I'm second choice.
    **Frasier:** I can't argue with that! [_coming over:_] There's something I 
             need to confess to you.  As much as I hoped that you would 
             get the job, there was a very small part of me - and a very 
             selfish part - that hoped you wouldn't.
        **Roz:** That's not bad.  That's really kinda sweet. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.  Because I happened to 
             mention those feelings to Bebe.
        **Roz:**[_shocked:_] Bebe?  You told Bebe?!
    **Frasier:** Just in passing.
        **Roz:** Oh, great.  She torpedoed me, didn't she?
    **Frasier:** Yes... well, she said I'd quit if you got the job.
        **Roz:** I can't believe this!
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm glad to see that you're as mad at her as I am.
        **Roz:** I'm mad at you!
    **Frasier:** Me?
        **Roz:** How could you have done that? 
    **Frasier:** Well, it was just an offhand remark, how did I know how 
             she'd react?
        **Roz:** She's _Bebe!_  If you had said you liked my eyes, they would 
             have been on your desk tomorrow in a Tiffany box!
    **Frasier:** Oh Roz, I'm so sorry.  Just tell me how I can make it up to 
             you.  I promise I will. 
        **Roz:** You mean it?
    **Frasier:** Yes, anything, just name it!
        **Roz:** Fire Bebe.
    **Frasier:**[_surprised:_] Well, em, how... isn't there something else 
             you'd like?
        **Roz:** The only thing I wanted was that job, and she took it away. 
             I'm not just suggesting this for my sake - I'm suggesting it 
             for yours.  She is your representative.  When she goes out 
             into the world lying and twisting your words and stabbing 
             people in the back, it reflects badly on you. 
    **Frasier:** You're right, Roz.  How can I consider myself an ethical 
             person when I have the Princess of Darkness conducting my 
             business for me?  Well, that's it, I'm going to have to fire 
             that conniving harpy.
        **Roz:** I'm very proud of you. 
    **Frasier:** I'm ashamed to think how long I've turned a blind eye on her 
             unscrupulous behaviour.  What for?  A 20% pay increase... 
             six-week paid vacation... an expense account... a travel 
             allowance...
        **Roz:**[_worried:_] Frasier?
    **Frasier:**[_mad:_] Well, not anymore! 
    _He exits, followed by Roz.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **ACROSS THE RIVER STYX**
    
    _Scene Two - Bebe's Office.
    Frasier and Roz are in Bebe's waiting room.  Vera, an old secretary, 
    talks into her phone summoning Bebe._
    
       **Vera:** Frasier Crane's here.  He's not alone. [_to Frasier:_] Have a 
             seat.
       **Bebe:**[_enters waiting room:_] Frasier, Roz, my two favourite 
             people. 
        **Roz:** Not for long.
    **Frasier:** Bebe, we're going to discuss what happened this morning - 
             this time you won't wink your way out of it!
       **Bebe:** This is serious, you two come right in - we'll solve this 
             thing.  Let's just promise to be totally honest with each 
             other. 
    
    _Frasier and Roz enter the office as Bebe speaks to Vera aside._
    
       **Bebe:** We're losing one.  Code red!
    
    _Bebe enters the office and sits at her desk.  Signed photos of her 
    clients decorate the room. A picture of Frasier and one of Bulldog 
    are in prime place on the wall._
    
       **Bebe:** What can I get you?  Champagne?
        **Roz:** Nothing.
       **Bebe:** A massage?
    **Frasier:** No, thank you.
       **Bebe:** You sure?  Vladimir can be here in five minutes, he will 
             play your spine like a Steinway.
        **Roz:** Can we just get started?
       **Bebe:** Roz, I'm just a wreck about our misunderstanding today.  
             Will you ever forgive me? 
        **Roz:** No. 
       **Bebe:** Why should you?  I don't forgive myself.
    **Frasier:** Bebe, what you did today was unfair, and not just to Roz but 
             to me. 
    
    _As Frasier begins his speech Vera walks in with a tray.  She puts it 
    down on the desk and begins taking pills and putting them in glasses. 
    Then she pours a glass of water.  Bebe takes these simultaneously 
    until it gets beyond a joke._
    
    **Frasier:**[_throughout the above:_] Thanks to you, a strain has been put 
             on our relationship... both professional and... personally. 
             All of this I might be able to let go of as an isolated 
             incident, but... I am concerned that... [_narked off about 
             the pill taking:_] Are you quite alright?!
       **Bebe:** It's nothing, it's just a silly little cardiac thing. [_to 
             Vera:_] Go, go, you're distracting my client.  My clients 
             come first.
    _Vera begins to leave with the tray, however Roz picks the pill bottle 
    up and shows it to Frasier as Vera exits._
    
        **Roz:** Oh, poor Bebe, how many fake pills do you have to take 
             everyday?
    **Frasier:** Yes, do you really think that you can sit there popping a 
             bunch of... [_sees label:_] Digitalis!  Oh my God!  You really 
             are sick.
    
    [_N.B. Harriet Harris played a psychotic clone doctor in the X-Files
    episode, "Eve," at the end of which her character is poisoned by a 
    fatal dose of digitalis._]
    
       **Bebe:** Well, of course I'm sick.  But it makes me even sicker to 
             think that I've angered your will when all I wanted to do 
             was keep the best damn team in radio together!
        **Roz:** Oh God, we're gonna need a shovel to get out of here!
    **Frasier:** Alright Bebe, be that as it may, but I still...
    
    _The phone interrupts Frasier.  Bebe answers it._
    
       **Bebe:**[_angry into phone:_] I told you, no calls! [_listens_] What 
             about my sister? [_to Frasier and Roz:_] One second. [_into 
             phone:_] Did the air bag deploy? [_traumatised:_] Look, I'm 
             gonna to have to call you back.  Frasier's here, and my 
             clients come first! [_hangs up, then nearly crying:_] Sorry, 
             you were saying?
    **Frasier:** Since the moment we met you showed yourself to be ruthless 
             and untrustworthy.  As these are qualities I do not wish to 
             have associated with my name, I think it's best we simply 
             part...
    
    _Yet again the phone interrupts his speech.  Bebe again answers on 
    speaker phone._
    
       **Bebe:**[_answers:_] What did I say about calls?!
       **Girl:**[_young girl voice on phone crying:_] Aunty Bebe.
       **Bebe:**[_holding a girl's picture in her hand_] Susy.  Sorry to hear 
             about your mummy's accident. 
       **Girl:** I'm frightened, Aunty Bebe. 
       **Bebe:** Don't be, little one.
       **Girl:** If mummy goes to heaven, will you take care of me?
       **Bebe:** Of course, my little lamb, assuming that I have the 
             resources.
    **Frasier:**[_intrigued:_] Bebe, you know I can't help noticing that none 
             of your outside lines are lit up!
       **Bebe:**[_crying:_] The bulbs are broken! [_to phone:_] I'm going to 
             have to go.  I'm with a client and you know what we say 
             about clients.
    
    _Frasier opens the door at this point revealing Vera on the phone 
    imitating the young girl._
    
       **Vera:**[_in girl's voice:_] They always come firth.
        **Roz:** You are amazing! 
    **Frasier:**[_to Bebe:_] Is there nothing you won't stoop to? 
       **Bebe:**[_feigning shock:_] I had no idea who I was speaking to! [_to 
             Vera:_] How dare you impersonate my niece?!  I've had enough 
             of your cruel jokes - you're fired, mother! 
    
    _Vera just shrugs._
    
       **Bebe:**[_to Frasier:_] I just want to say...
    **Frasier:** No, stop it!  Not one more crooked word!  Your tongue could 
             open a wine bottle.  From now, Frasier Crane has resigned 
             from your coven. 
       **Bebe:**[_upset:_] Huh! That's it, is it?  I'm not virtuous enough 
             for you, not noble.  Fine, quit!  Next time you need a deal 
             made, call the Dalai Lama.  A long time ago, I had to make a 
             choice between being a good agent and a good person, because 
             trust me, you can't be both!  So forgive me if I don't have 
             time to make everybody warm and fuzzy.  I am just too busy 
             spending every waking minute pouring any drink, pulling any 
             shameless tricks I can to make my clients' dreams come true! 
             I am a starmaker!  And if you can't appreciate that, there 
             are plenty that can! [_to Roz:_] How about you, you want an 
             agent.
    **Frasier:** Oh pu-leeze!
        **Roz:** You mean it?
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:** I've never had an agent.  It's not like she worships the 
             Devil.
    **Frasier:** Well, she doesn't have to!  He worships her!
        **Roz:** You're absolutely right, Frasier.  Forget it, Bebe.  No way! 
       **Bebe:** That voice - I could listen to it all day.  It's pure, yet 
             smouldering - like a nun with a past.
        **Roz:** You think so? 
    **Frasier:** No, Roz, don't look her in the eye!
       **Bebe:** I could triple your salary - voice-overs, commercials...
    **Frasier:** Roz, listen to me, for God's sake.  If you've got the 
             tiniest shred of sense or dignity left, remember what this 
             woman did to you this afternoon and renounce her.  She has 
             no scruples, no ethics, and no reflection! 
        **Roz:** Oh, let's get out of here. 
    **Frasier:**[_to Bebe:_] Well, nice doing business with you. [_pauses, then 
             obvious and nasty:_] WINK!
    
    _Frasier and Roz walk out into the foyer._
    
         **Roz:** Oh!  Frasier, I forgot my purse. 
     **Frasier:** Alright.
    
    _Roz sticks her head back into the office._
    
        **Roz:** Lunchtime tomorrow?
       **Bebe:** 12:30, Benardi's.
    
    _Roz nods and leaves.
    
    Fade Out.
    
    End Of Act Two_ [Time: 21:10]
    
    **Credits:**
     
    Bebe is talking to another client in her office - a man with a 
    monkey.  He is obviously complaining about her as Bebe is taking the 
    pills that are being given to her by Vera again.  Eventually the 
    monkey man gets weary and leaves the office.  Bebe begins spitting 
    the pills out.
