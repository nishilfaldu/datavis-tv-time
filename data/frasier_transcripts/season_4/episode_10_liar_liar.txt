    _Act 1
    
    Scene 1 -- Frasier's Apartment. 
    Frasier is seeing a guest off the premises.  Both are dressed in 
    tuxedos, as are Niles, Martin and Bulldog who are also in the room. 
    Roz and Daphne are decked out in elegant eveningwear.
    _
    **Frasier:**[_opening the front door as the guest walks out_] Glad you came 
             back with us.  I hope you had a good time.  Well, I can't tell 
             you how much fun this has been.  Listen, now that you know the 
             way don't be a stranger.  OK.  Good night! [_closes the door 
             after the man_] Who the hell was that? 
      **Niles:** He's not from the station? 
        **Roz:** I never saw him before. 
     **Daphne:** He was table-hopping like crazy during the awards. 
     **Martin:** That's ï¿½cause he was our waiter. 
    **Frasier:** Well, that's the last time I say, "everybody back to my  
             place!" 
    **Bulldog:**[_holding up his SeaBea_] Who cares about that guy?  This is a 
             great night. 
        **Roz:** For you, maybe.  The rest of us lost. 
    **Bulldog:** Hey, it's not important whether you win or lose.  It's an 
             honour just being nomin... [_breaks into laughter_] I couldn't 
             get through that crap on stage, I can't get through it now!  
        **Roz:** Frasier, do you mind if I use your phone? 
    **Frasier:** No, not at all.  Who are you calling?  It's practically 
             midnight. 
        **Roz:** Oh, I promised my grandmother I'd leave her a message telling 
             her how we did. [_dials the number then starts speaking into          
             the phone_] Hey Gammy, it's Roz.  Guess what?  We won again! 
             We're all here celebrating. 
    _Roz holds up the phone to indicate they make some kind of noise of 
    celebration.  All they can muster is a half-hearted "YEAH!" sounding 
    completely unconvincing._
        **Roz:** Listen, I gotta go.  It's getting crazy here but I'll talk 
             to you tomorrow.  Bye-bye. 
      **Niles:** You lied to "Gammy?" 
        **Roz:** Well, she's old and it makes her happy.  She smiled for a 
             week when I won the Miss Seattle Pageant! 
    **Frasier:** You know, Roz raises a very interesting philosophical 
             question... 
     **Martin:**[_preparing for the worst_] Oh, here we go.  Buckle up! 
    **Frasier:** Is it always morally wrong to lie?  We are taught that it is.
             Though obviously there are certain occasions when a lie 
             would be acceptable. 
    **Bulldog:** Yeah, like the lies you tell a chick in bed.  "You're the 
             best I've ever been with"; "Your thighs don't look that fat"; 
             "Don't worry, I've had a vasectomy." [_Bulldog notes the 
             disgusted faces around the room_] Hey, screw you guys!  I'm 
             an artist; we live by different rules. 
      **Niles:** An argument can certainly be made that a lie is good when it 
             spares someone unnecessary pain.  I'm reminded of Maris's 
             brief flirtation with active wear when I assured her, "You 
             look fine, darling.  Spandex is supposed to blouse!" 
    **Frasier:** You know, Lilith actually told me the other day that Frederick 
             has taken to lying.  Yes, he told all of his friends that 
             Lilith is an alien. [_laughs_] 
     **Martin:** Seems as good an explanation as any! 
    **Frasier:** He also told them that she wears her hair in a bun to hide 
             the third eye in the back of her head. [_laughs again_] 
        **Roz:** How did Lilith find out? 
    **Frasier:** Well, apparently she was driving him and Toby to a Junior 
             Mensa meeting, she looked in the rearview mirror and saw
             that they were making faces at the other cars.  So, never 
             have the words "_I_ can see you!" caused so much screaming and 
             wetting of pants!
    _Laughter all around._
     **Daphne:** I did my fair share of fibbing too.  I once told my school 
             chums I was born with a tiny embryonic twin attached to my 
             hip. [_Daphne laughs hilariously whilst the others look 
             slightly perturbed_] Of course they were horrified and it 
             didn't help my social life at all. [_sighs_] But for a while 
             there it was nice having a sister. 
    _Niles nods his head in sympathy before subtly removing the glass of 
    champagne from Daphne's hand and passing it to Frasier who nods his 
    head in agreement._
      **Niles:** Oh.  Remember in prep school when we were so desperate to 
             avoid The President's Physical Fitness Test... 
    **Frasier:**...that we lit a match underneath the fire alarm and all the 
             sprinklers went off. 
      **Niles:** And we blamed that delinquent kid, John Rajeski. 
    **Frasier:** Yes. 
     **Martin:**[_appalled_] You did what? 
    **Frasier:** What's wrong? 
     **Martin:** You two swore up and down to me that you never set off that 
             alarm. 
    **Frasier:**[_laughing_] Well, of course we weren't going to tell you. 
    _Martin storms off into the kitchen._
      **Niles:** For Heaven's sake, Dad, you can't be mad.  We were kids. 
     **Martin:**[_turning back_] You know, the headmaster said it was you two. 
             I went down there and raised hell with him.  I said, "My kids 
             don't lie."  Because of you that Rajeski kid got expelled! 
    **Frasier:**[_shocked_] Expelled?  If we'd have known that was going to 
             happen we would have told the truth. 
      **Niles:**[_unrepentant_] Not me.  He was a brute and a meanie. 
    **Frasier:** You're right.  He used to make the most merciless fun of me, 
             about how I always wore my gym shorts in the shower.  He used 
             to call me "Shorts In The Shower Boy."  You don't have to be 
             witty to be cruel. 
     **Martin:** Well, I don't give a damn what that kid did.  Getting him 
             expelled was worse. [_angrily_] I'm going to bed.  Good night, 
             everybody. 
    _Everyone says good night as Martin goes through to the bedroom._
    **Frasier:** Well, I guess that brings an end to our little debate. 
             Apparently there are no good lies. 
    **Bulldog:** Hey, hey, it's getting kinda heavy in here.  We gotta liven 
             this place up, huh?  Hey, I know -- party games, huh?  All 
             right Doc, I'm going to need a blindfold, whipped cream and 
             a glass coffee table. [_everyone looks mystified_] What? 
             Nobody went to camp? 
        **Roz:**[_getting up_] Forget it, Bulldog.  These guys are no fun. 
             [_grabs his butt as she walks past_] You know what?  I know a 
             great after-hours place where we can go get a few drinks. 
    **Bulldog:**[_rushing after Roz to the front door_] Now you're talking. 
             Hey, if things go well I know an _after_ after-hours place.  
             And I got the keys. 
        **Roz:** Mmm.  You get the elevator; I'll get my coat. 
    **Bulldog:** You're on. 
    _Bulldog rushes out and Roz closes the door behind him, firmly 
    locking it._
        **Roz:** No good lies, my ass! 
    _Daphne laughs and Frasier and Niles toast each other with their 
    champagne.
    
    FADE OUT
    
    Scene 2 -- Cafe Nervosa. 
    Niles walks in and sees Frasier sitting down.  Niles hangs up his 
    coat before sitting down.  It is apparent that both brothers are 
    wearing exactly the same suit right down to the shirt and tie.
    _
      **Niles:** Good morning, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, good morning, Niles... [_suddenly notices Niles's suit_]
             Oh dear God -- it's finally happened.  This is the thanks I 
             get for introducing you to my personal shopper.  I gave her 
             specific instructions to write down every article of clothing 
             that I had purchased so we could avoid this sort of calamity!
      **Niles:** I didn't use Renaldo.  This suit just caught my eye while I 
             was shopping for shoes.
    _Niles and Frasier suddenly stop and stare tentatively at each 
    other's shoes.  They both reel back in horror as they realise they've 
    got the same as well._
      **Niles:**[_annoyed_] Well, why didn't you also take my strong chin and 
             swimmer's build?
    **Frasier:** Oh please.
      **Niles:** Obviously we have to sit apart.
    **Frasier:** Sit down!  There's something I need to talk to you about.  
             I doubt most people are as tuned to these things as you and 
             I are.  I'm sure they won't even notice.
    _At this point the waitress approaches with two coffees._
    **Waitress:**[_to Frasier_] Here you are, double espresso. [_to Niles_] 
              I took a chance and brought you the same thing. [_leaves_]
     **Frasier:** After our conversation last night I couldn't stop thinking 
              about our getting John Rajeski expelled.  I didn't sleep a 
              wink.
       **Niles:** You can't be serious?
     **Frasier:** You mean it didn't bother you?  Where is your conscience?
       **Niles:** Perhaps it fell into the quad - along with my hall monitor 
              beret when John hung me from the flagpole!  He was going to 
              be expelled sooner or later.  You cannot guilt me into 
              feeling bad.
     **Frasier:** Yes, well, no one hated him more than I did but I still 
              think we owe him an apology.  Can I borrow your phone, 
              Niles?
       **Niles:** Certainly. [_hands over phone then suddenly realises_] You're 
              not going to call him?
     **Frasier:** I am.
       **Niles:** Are you insane?
     **Frasier:**[_speaking into the phone_] A number for a John Rajeski, 
              please? [_speaking to Niles_] Niles, my conscience won't 
              rest until the two of us have said we're sorry. [_speaking 
              into phone_] Oh yes, connect me please.
       **Niles:** Leave me out of this.  I'm not sorry.  But don't tell him 
              that.  And if he asks, I'm living in Italy.  No, no, France. 
              No, Italy!
     **Frasier:**[_speaking into the phone_] Yes, hello.  Is John Rajeski there, 
              please?  It's an old friend... Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear 
              that.  Thank you. [_hangs up_] Niles, it's worse than we 
              thought -- he's in prison.
       **Niles:**[_smug_] Well... who's wearing shorts in the shower now?
     **Frasier:** Well, joke all you like.  I still can't help thinking this 
              is all our fault.
       **Niles:** How?
     **Frasier:** Well, he was always on the cusp.  Maybe he couldn't get 
              into another prep school.  Maybe he had to go to public.  
              Got in with the wrong crowd.  Couldn't hold on to a job.  
              He could turn to a life of crime.
       **Niles:** Frasier.  Sometimes bad things happen to bad people.  We did 
              not set him on the path to prison.
     **Frasier:** Yes, well until I'm sure of that fact my conscience will 
              not rest.  I have got to speak with him. [_to waiter_] Can I 
              have the check, please?
       **Niles:**[_incredulous_] You're not going down to the jail?
     **Frasier:** Yes, I am.  I invite you to join me.
       **Niles:**[_sarcastic_] Yes, that's a good idea, Frasier.  The Crane 
              boys going to a prison in matching outfits!
    _FADE TO:_
    **DEAD MAN TALKING**
    _Scene 3 -- The prison. 
    Frasier is nervously walking round a room bare except for a table and
    two chairs in the middle of the floor.  John Rajeski is brought in by 
    a guard.
    _
    [_N.B. John Rajeski is actually the name of one of the show's producer's 
    assistants.  He appears as a Cafe Nervosa waiter in[[_3.24_], "You Can Go 
    Home Again."_]
    
       **John:** Frasier Crane?
    **Frasier:** John.
       **John:**[_smiling and shaking his hand_] Hey.  How's it going?
    **Frasier:** Well, fine.  And you?
       **John:** Eh... [_shrugs and waves at his surroundings_] What brings you 
             down here?
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't know if you get the alumni magazine, but I 
             became a psychiatrist, and I'm currently conducting a study 
             on men behind bars and how they got there... [_notices John's 
             fists_] That's an awfully nasty bruise on your knuckles.
       **John:**[_laughs_] I caught some guy using my comb.  I really hate it 
             when people touch my stuff.
      **Niles:** Oh, yes.  I remember my brother Niles once sat in your chair 
             in the cafeteria.  As I recall you put him on a tray and ran 
             him through the dishwasher.
       **John:** Yeah, class clown -- that was me. [_both laugh at this_] How is 
             Niles, anyway?
    **Frasier:** Ah, er... ah, he's abroad now.
       **John:** Really?  Whoa, that must have hurt.
    **Frasier:** No, no, I mean, er... yes, I suppose it did!  Well anyway, 
             it would be an enormous help in my study if you could perhaps 
             pinpoint the moment or event in your life that led you to 
             here.
       **John:** Ah, that's easy.  I'm doing time for passing a bad check.
    **Frasier:** Ah. [_begins writing in his notebook_]
       **John:** You see, I wanted to get my wife something nice.  We're 
             going through a rough time recently.  I was scared she was 
             going to leave me, you know?
    **Frasier:**[_relieved_] Well, that was quick and painless.  We've 
             identified the point where you fell off the beam. [_gets up 
             to leave_]
       **John:** Actually though, I was already on probation.  I did some time 
             about ten years back for driving a car that didn't belong to 
             me.
    **Frasier:** And that was your first infraction?
       **John:** Yeah.
    **Frasier:**[_getting up again_] Well then, case closed, mystery solved. 
             A young man yields to the lure of a bright and shiny car.  
             Is there anything more tragic?
       **John:** I did have a juvenile record.
    **Frasier:**[_sitting down again_] Apparently there is.
       **John:** I got in a high school fight.
    **Frasier:** You did say high school, not prep school?
       **John:** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is way after you knew me.  I 
             went bad then.  Always getting into fights.  Of course I 
             wouldn't have been there in the first place if I hadn't have 
             gotten thrown out of that good school me and you were in.  
             That had a big effect on me you know?
    **Frasier:** Yes well, perhaps we could continue our backward journey 
             through...
       **John:**[_getting up_] No, no, no.  That was a bum rap.  Somebody 
             pulled the fire alarm and they blamed me for it.  They said 
             I did it but I didn't do it.
    **Frasier:**[_becoming visibly worried_] Let's discuss your early 
             childhood.
       **John:**[_stamping his fist off the desk in anger_] You know, the more 
             I think about it, this all started the day I got thrown out 
             of prep school.  Ever since then my life's been crap!  CRAP! 
             [_now banging the desk in rage_]
    **Frasier:**[_hurriedly gathering his notebook and getting up_] I think I 
             have all the information I need now.
       **John:** Sorry, I didn't mean to blow like that.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's all right, John. [_shaking hands with John_] Thank 
             you for your time.
       **John:** I got plenty of it.  I'll see you, huh?
    **Frasier:**[_nervously thinking as John knocks on the door to leave_] No, 
             no, John.  There's just one more thing. [_turns to the guard 
             who's ready to take John back_] One second, please. [_turns to 
             John_] There's something I need to tell you about, something 
             that I did in school that I'm not very proud of...
    _At this point a very large, very burly fellow prisoner covered in 
    bruises and a neck cast appears at the door._
    **Prisoner:** Yo, John.  Sorry I touched your comb, man.
    _Needless to say Frasier looks frightened out of his wits as the 
    prisoner scuttles off._
       **John:** So what did you do?
    **Frasier:** Er... well, I, er... I peeked over your shoulder once during 
             an algebra quiz.
       **John:**[_jokingly_] And I'm the one who gets expelled?
    _John is led away by the guard leaving Frasier wondering how he can 
    break the news to John.
    
    End of Act 1
    
    Act 2
    
    Scene 1 -- Frasier's Apartment.  Martin is sitting back in his chair. 
    Daphne opens the front door to a limping, leaning Niles.
    _
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne, Dad.
     **Daphne:** Something wrong with your back?
      **Niles:** I injured it this morning playing squash.  I had to make a 
             dive to save match point.
     **Daphne:** Well, I've got just the thing to take care of that.  You take 
             off your jacket, I'll be right back. [_goes to the powder room_]
      **Niles:** You're too kind.  You know, I should never even have attempted 
             a move like that.  It was sort of a cross between a pirouette
             and a flying scissor kick.
    _Daphne looks suitably impressed before closing the door._
     **Martin:** You hurt yourself adjusting the seat in your Mercedes again, 
             didn't you?
      **Niles:** Quiet!
    _Daphne returns with a small tub of something._
     **Daphne:** All right, pull out your shirttails and lay facedown on the 
             sofa.  I can guarantee you within a minute you'll be feeling 
             much better. [_Niles lies down and mutters a moan of 
             satisfaction_] I haven't even touched you yet!
      **Niles:** I started without you.
    _Daphne proceeds to rub Niles's back with some sort of liniment._
     **Martin:**[_concerned_] Hey, wait a minute.  You're not gonna use that 
             stuff on him, are you?  She used it on me one time, it burned 
             like hell!
     **Daphne:** Oh, hush up, old man.  It helped you, didn't it?
     **Martin:** It nearly killed me!
     **Daphne:** Listen to the big tough policeman.  You don't hear your son 
             complaining, do we, Dr. Crane?
      **Niles:**[_in heaven_] Not a bit!  Frost me like a cake!
     **Martin:** Well, just wait a minute.  It goes on cool but it then it 
             turns into a blowtorch.
     **Daphne:** Well, I guess now we know who the real man in the family is, 
             don't we?
      **Niles:** I should say we d...[_winces slightly_] Ooh!
    _Martin smiles at him._
     **Daphne:** Is it starting to warm up?
      **Niles:**[_wincing a little more_] Ahh, yeah!  It's a... refreshing heat, 
             like those towels they give you on the airplane. [_clearly 
             feigning pleasure_] Whoooo!
     **Daphne:** I'm not hurting you, am I?
      **Niles:** No, no.  I'm just a little ticklish back there. 
    _He bites down on the pillow to muffle his screams._
     **Martin:** Well, I guess you are the tough one!
     **Daphne:**[_getting up_] There you go.
     **Martin:** Oh, no, wait a minute, Daphne -- you missed a big spot right 
             there.
      **Niles:**[_hastily getting up_] No, that's OK!  Because it's all done 
             now!  Thank you, Daphne! [_in agony_] A few minutes ago I was 
             bent over in pain, [_rushes for the kitchen bounding over the 
             coffee table_] but now look at me, I'm running!
    _Niles heads straight for the refrigerator, finds a bag of frozen 
    peas and stuffs them down the back of his shirt, followed by the tub 
    of ice cream.  He turns around and desperately rubs his back against 
    the fridge.  Back in the living room Daphne is talking to Martin._
     **Daphne:** How is that hip of yours, anyway?
     **Martin:** Back off, witch woman!
    _The front door opens and Frasier walks in._
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Evening, Daphne.
     **Martin:** How did you get on at the jail?
    **Frasier:** Horribly!  The man is convinced that getting thrown out of 
             prep school was the beginning of his life of crime. 
     **Martin:** Been thinking that all these years?
    **Frasier:**[_disconsolate_] No.  I sort of connected the dots for him!
     **Martin:** You tell him it was you?
    **Frasier:** I intended to, but I became convinced that the man would be 
             willing to perform unspeakable atrocities on the responsible 
             party or parties.
     **Martin:** Well, you probably made the right call.  Knowing you, you'd 
             beat yourself up worse than he would anyway.
      **Niles:**[_emerging from the kitchen_] I hope you remembered to tell 
             him I was an expatriate.
    **Frasier:** I told him you were an ex-something. [_Niles looks confused._] 
             You know, I just feel so guilty.  I have done this man a 
             terrible injustice.
     **Daphne:** You know, Dr. Crane, I've always believed life has a way of 
             balancing itself out.  Yes, you may have treated this man 
             unfairly, but think of all the people you've helped on your 
             show.  Just yesterday you reconciled that couple on the 
             brink of divorce and today you helped Molly from Tacoma 
             overcome her addiction to Swedes.
    _Martin and Niles both stop what they're doing and look up confused._
    **Frasier:** That was sweets, not Swedes!
     **Daphne:** I thought it was strange when you told her to limit herself 
             to one or two after meals.
    **Frasier:** You know, perhaps I just have an overactive conscience.  
             It's not enough that I help other people, I want to help 
             this man.
      **Niles:** Well, I hope you do, Frasier because then finally you'll 
             stop torturing the rest of us with all your... [_bends over 
             and suddenly cries out in agony_] Oh, pain's back!
     **Martin:** Not to worry.  She's got more liniment.
      **Niles:**[_suddenly standing upright still in agony_] Oh, pain's gone!
     **Daphne:** Come on now.  Be brave. [_drags Niles's behind her_] Let's 
             go into the loo and I'll give you a second coat. 
    _Niles stretches out his hand in a last-ditch bid to stay out of 
    Daphne's clutches but Martin just smiles at him as he is dragged 
    into the powder room._
    **Frasier:** You know, Dad, Daphne gave me a thought.  I'm a skilled 
             couples' therapist.  John did mention that he was having 
             marital problems...
     **Martin:** Oh, Jeez!
    **Frasier:**[_heading for the phone_] No, no, Dad.  This is perfect, this 
             is perfect.  I may have ruined the last 25 years of this 
             man's life but with my gift I could save the next 25. 
             [_speaks into the phone_] Yes, a listing for a John Rajeski, 
             please.
     **Martin:** I'm telling you, Frasier, don't get mixed up with this guy. 
             He's a felon.
    **Frasier:** Dad, just relax, please -- I know what I'm doing. [_speaks into 
             the phone_] Mrs. Rajeski?  Hello, you don't know me but I'm...
    _A piercing scream comes from the bathroom as the second coat is 
    obviously being applied._
    **Frasier:** Why - well, that's remarkable.  Yes, I am a friend of your 
             husband's!
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene 2 -- Susan Rajeski's apartment.  Frasier knocks on the door and 
    Susan opens.
    _
    **Frasier:** Mrs. Rajeski?
      **Susan:** Wow, it's really you -- Frasier Crane!
    **Frasier:** May I?
      **Susan:** Oh gosh, I'm sorry.  Please, please come in. [_Frasier walks 
             in_] You know, you're kind of like a God at work. [_Frasier 
             looks a bit humbled_] Please, please sit down.
    **Frasier:**[_sitting down_] Thank you.  Let me cut right to the chase. 
             John told me that you two were going through a bit of a 
             rough patch and I was wondering if there was anything I 
             could do to help?
      **Susan:** Well, I love John.  I really do, but there is a problem.  
             It's just a little difficult talking about it, you know?  I 
             mean, it's a little embarrassing -- especially face-to-face.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'll tell you what.  Just pretend I'm on my radio show, 
             [_turns his back to Susan_] and now you're just another  
             caller.
      **Susan:** OK.  Well, Dr. Crane, it's a sexual problem.
    **Frasier:** Ah.
      **Susan:** You see, I can only get really turned on when there's 
             something that makes the whole situation sort of dangerous.
    **Frasier:**[_turning round_] Dangerous?
      **Susan:** You're looking at me.
    **Frasier:**[_turning back round_] Sorry.
      **Susan:** Like doing it in a car.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's not so dangerous.
      **Susan:** You must be some driver.
    **Frasier:**[_realises_] Oh.  And you've never had an accident?
      **Susan:** No, I'm on the pill!
    **Frasier:**[_back still turned_] So how long have you had this particular 
             kink?
      **Susan:**[_standing up starts playing with her buttons_] Well, I don't 
             know really.  It kind of started around the time that I 
             first met John.  I was working in a convenience store, I 
             caught him shoplifting.  Next thing I knew we were rolling 
             around on the Slurpy machine and I'd already pressed the 
             silent alarm so I knew that the cops were on their way...
    _She rips off her dress to reveal a sexy black negligee.  Frasier is 
    still sitting on the couch, back turned, unaware._
      **Susan:** That's when I realised what really turns me on - knowing I 
             could get caught at any moment. [_leaps onto Frasier's lap_]
    **Frasier:**[_horrified_] Oh, Dear God!  He's out of jail, isn't he?
      **Susan:** He could walk in at any time.
    **Frasier:** He'll kill us!
      **Susan:**[_writhing in pleasure_] Ooh, touch me here and say that.
    **Frasier:**[_struggling up with Susan still attached_] ARE YOU CRAZY?!  
             He doesn't even let people touch his comb!
      **Susan:** I know.  What's that all about?
    **Frasier:**[_backing off_] You might like to put your dress back on, 
             straighten up before he gets home.
    _As Frasier heads for the front door there is a rattling on the other 
    side.  John is home._
       **John:** Open up.
    **Frasier:**[_panicking_] You only have time for one -- I suggest the 
             dress.  Where's the bedroom?
      **Susan:** You're in it.
    **Frasier:** Listen, you've got to get him out of here.
      **Susan:**[_excited_] And pass the chance to have sex with him knowing 
             he could find you here at any minute?
    _She heads for the front door with a huge grin on her face.  Meanwhile 
    Frasier hides behind the sofa.  Susan opens the door to John._
      **Susan:**[_hugging John_] Welcome home, baby!
       **John:**[_hugging Susan then noticing the negligee_] What are you doing?
      **Susan:** Well, I'm just getting ready for you.  Oh, I missed you.  So, 
             do you want to?
       **John:** Sure I do, but, er... you mean normally.  The super's not 
             going to barge in?  You didn't dial 911 or anything like that?
      **Susan:** I've got everything I need right here in this room.
    _Behind the sofa, Frasier rolls his eyes._
       **John:**[_kissing Susan_] I'm just going to pull down the shades. [_heads 
             for the shades, which are next to the sofa_]
      **Susan:** Wait, wait!
    _John walks behind the sofa then stops suddenly as he looks down._
       **John:**[_angrily_] What the hell is this?! 
    _Susan looks caught, but he bends down and picks up a pair of high 
    heels._
       **John:** How much did you spend on these?
      **Susan:** Oh, Johnny, can't we talk about that later? 
       **John:**[_hugging Susan_] Why don't you turn off the light?
    _Susan turns off the light.  Unfortunately the moonlight streams in 
    through the open window, highlighting Frasier's silhouette hiding 
    behind a paper screen, clearly visible behind John.  Susan hurriedly 
    switches the lights back on._
      **Susan:** It's too dark.  I want to see you.
       **John:** Whatever you want, baby.  This is going to be great.  I am 
             going to make love to you all night.
    _Frasier, still in hiding, throws his hands up in despair._
       **John:** But first, I have a surprise for you.  I wrote a poem for you 
             while I was in prison. [_takes out a piece of paper and begins 
             reading_] "I am a garden, dry and brown.  You are the rain that
             tumbles down, Susan.  I am a beggar that needs to eat, you are 
             a sandwich thick with meat, Susan."
    _By now Frasier has had enough and, revisiting his childhood, he 
    holds a lighter up to the smoke alarm.  Needless to say this switches 
    the sprinkler system on, practically drowning John and Susan._
       **John:** Oh my God.  I knew you had something planned -- you set the 
             building on fire!
      **Susan:** No I didn't, I swear.
       **John:** Come on, let's get out of here.
      **Susan:** Oh, but the firemen -- they're on their way.
       **John:** Come on!
    _John grabs Susan and drags her out of the now-soaked room.  
    
    A drenched Frasier emerges from his hiding place looking satisfied 
    with himself.  He picks the poem up that has been left on the sofa, 
    takes one look at it then discards it with a look of disgust.  
    He checks the doorway before walking out.
    
    End of Act 2_
    **Credits:**
    
    Eddie is on the sofa in Frasier's Apartment whilst Niles goes to put 
    a magazine onto the coffee table.  Unfortunately as he bends down he 
    gets stuck again and is in obvious pain.  Eddie looks on. 
    
    Cue Daphne who rushes out the bedroom and sees Niles in distress.  
    She rushes over to help and Niles, deciding that he's not going 
    through the burning process again, pretends that he is actually 
    leaning down to stroke Eddie.  
    
    After much pretending and feigning of smiles, Daphne believes him and 
    goes back to the bedroom.  Niles waits until she is gone before 
    struggling to the front door in agony and gets out as fast as he can.
