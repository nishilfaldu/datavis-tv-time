    _Act One.
    
    Scene One - Radio Station.
    Frasier is about to begin his show and is sat at his control panel. 
    Roz is in her booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz?  None of these lights seem to be flashing.
        **Roz:** Hey, what do you know, I got the same thing over here.
    **Frasier:** Well, who's our first caller?
        **Roz:** No-one.
    **Frasier:** Well, how much time do we have?
        **Roz:** None. [_points_]
    **Frasier:**[_on air:_] Hello Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Well, 
             I have some good news for you.  As today is the first sunny 
             day we've had in a few weeks, it seems that all our lines 
             are open.  So please call in, no waiting. [_nothing_] Absolutely 
             no waiting!  Oh come on, somebody's marriage must be on the 
             skids.  Somebody's career must be going badly, [_laughs_] 
             other than mine!  Hey, how about all you agoraphobics, I know 
             you're not outside! [_notices light:_] Oh, there's a call! 
             I'll take it, I'll take it. [_presses button:_] Hello, I'm 
             listening.
      **Alice:**[_v.o:_] Hi Dr. Crane, my name is Alice and I'm usually a happy 
             person but today, well, I just started thinking about all 
             kinds of sad things.  My job isn't that exciting, my kids 
             don't call me... pretty soon I was in a full-blown funk.
    **Frasier:** Well, Alice, as today seems to be a bit slow I think I have 
             a story I can tell you that might be of some help.  Do you 
             have some time?
      **Alice:** Well, it's three 'o clock and I'm still in my bathrobe.
    **Frasier:** Perfect!  Well, it started three days ago.  You see, my father 
             was very concerned about his little dog, Eddie.  So, he had to 
             take him to the vet...
    _FLASHBACK TO: 
    
    Scene Two - Caf e Nervosa.
    The story starts off as we see Eddie laying unhappily on the floor 
    next to a cup of milk.  Daphne, Frasier, Roz and Martin are sat 
    around the table next to him._
    
        **Roz:** So what's the doctor say?
     **Martin:** He's stumped.  I told him, he's not sleeping, he's not 
             eating, he's not even sniffing stuff. 
    **Frasier:** Welcome news to Mrs. Frobisher in 13-B.
     **Martin:** He said he can't find anything wrong with him physically, 
             he thinks it might be an emotional problem.
     **Daphne:** You know, I've heard they have therapists for dogs.  Do you 
             suppose a dog psychiatrist could be the answer?
    **Frasier:** Only if the question is, "What is the most asinine thing we 
             could possibly do?"
     **Martin:** Maybe Eddie's just lonely, you know, I was thinking maybe we 
             could get another, er...
    **Frasier:** Stop right there, Dad!  We're not getting another dog.
     **Martin:** Oh, come on, what could be more fun than having a little 
             brother or sister around the house to play with?
    **Frasier:** I fell for that trick once, Dad!
     **Martin:** Well, I'm going to get this little guy home.
     **Daphne:** All right, I'll see you at home.  I'll pick up some beans 
             before I go.
    _Martin leaves with Eddie as Daphne goes to the counter to pick up her 
    beans.  Roz notices a man._
    
        **Roz:** Wow.  There's a guy over there checking me out.  He's coming 
             over here, get out.  No, it's too late, just pretend you're 
             not with me. 
      **Kagen:** Hello, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Dr. Kagen.
      **Kagen:** I hope I'm not interrupting you?
    **Frasier:** Oh, not at all.  I don't even know who she is.
        **Roz:** Frasier! [_to Kagen_] Hi, I'm Roz Doyle.
      **Kagen:** Dr. Stephen Kagen.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dr. Kagen moved into my building about three months ago - 
             from Chicago, I believe?
      **Kagen:** Yes, that's right.  I love what I've seen in Seattle but I'm 
             still finding my way around.
    **Frasier:** Well, Roz is an excellent tour guide.
      **Kagen:** Really?  Well, if you have an afternoon sometime, maybe you 
             could show me all the hotspots. 
    **Frasier:**[_laughs_] Oh, I think that can be arranged. 
        **Roz:** I'd be happy to.  I'm free tomorrow afternoon.  Here's my 
             card. [_hands it over_]
      **Kagen:** Great.  I'll give you a call.  Nice meeting you, Roz.  Dr. 
             Crane.
    **Frasier:** Dr. Kagen.
    
    _Dr. Kagen leaves as Frasier and Roz chat._
    
        **Roz:**[_laughs_] Thank you, Frasier!  A gorgeous doctor, and I 
             didn't get you anything! [_stares at him through window_] 
             So, what kind of doctor is he?
    **Frasier:** A gynecologist.
        **Roz:**[_snaps around_] That's not funny!
    **Frasier:** What's the matter?
        **Roz:** He really is?  Oh God, I can't go out with a gynecologist!
             Do you know what they do all day?
    **Frasier:** I have a general idea!
     **Daphne:**[_passes with beans_] All right, I'll see you at home. 
        **Roz:** Hey, would you date a gynecologist?
     **Daphne:** Oh God, no.
        **Roz:**[_to Frasier_] See?
     **Daphne:** I wouldn't even date a dentist.  Hands in people's mouths 
             all day!  And after watching Eddie's complete physical, 
             I'm not anxious to date a vet anytime soon!
    
    _As Daphne exits, we hear the sound of tapping on glass.
    
    CUT TO: 
    
    Radio Station.
    Frasier's story is interrupted by Roz banging on the control room 
    partition, holding up a card reading "WHY ARE YOU TELLING HER THIS?!"_
    **Frasier:** Oh, [_chuckles_] anyway, that's really more of a side trip.  
             Getting back to our story - by the time I got home that day, 
             alas, for Eddie was no better.
    _FLASHBACK TO:
    
    Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    Eddie is laid flat out on Martin's chair.  Martin is on the floor 
    waving a cuddly carrot in Eddie's face._
    
     **Martin:** Hey look, Eddie, Mr. Carrot!  Oh, he'll give you good 
             eyesight, you'll have a lot of fun with this too!
    **Frasier:**[_enters and sees the scene:_] Dad.
     **Martin:** Yeah?
    **Frasier:** What are you doing?
     **Martin:** Oh, I ran out and bought a bunch of new toys for Eddie.  
             I thought it just might cheer him up, you know?  Hey Eddie, 
             look at this. [_shows him a cuddly hamburger:_] Hamburger!  
             Juicy, meaty.  I bet you'd like a bite of this, wouldn't ya'?  
             No?  Well, then there's more for me. [_pretending to be
             hamburger:_] I sure hope you don't take a bite out of me at 
             the side. 
    
    _Eddie shows no reaction.  Martin gives up._
    
     **Martin:** Did you ever see anything sadder than this?
    **Frasier:** No, I can't say that I have.
    
    _The doorbell sounds as Daphne enters._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, that'll be Dr. Crane.  He said he was going to bring his 
             dog over.
     **Martin:** Oh, not that four-legged Maris!
    **Frasier:** Dad, please.  Don't call it that in front of him.  He has no 
             idea.
     **Martin:** How could he not?  It acts like Maris, it barks like Maris, 
             aside from the fact that it eats now and then they're dead 
             ringers!
    
    _Daphne opens the door to Niles and his Whippet, Girl._
    
     **Daphne:** Hello.
      **Niles:** Hello Daphne, hello all.  I heard Eddie was down, and I 
             thought a playmate might cheer him up, so voila!
     **Martin:** I appreciate the offer, Niles, but I've already tried it in 
             the park with real dogs and it didn't work. 
      **Niles:** Well, you'll change your tune when you see my Girl turn on 
             her charm. [_to Girl_] Go to Eddie.  Go to Eddie. [_nothing_] 
             Okay. 
    _Niles picks her up and keeps pushing her into Eddie's face, chanting 
    "Do your stuff."  Nothing happens, causing Frasier to laugh, Daphne 
    to roll her eyes and Martin to screw up his face._
    
      **Niles:** That's it. [_nothing_] Oh, oh, I can see her magic working 
             already.  Good girl.
    
    _She escapes and runs away down the corridor to Martin's room._
    
      **Niles:** Come back, Girl.  Come back here this instant! [_nothing_] Okay. 
             [_prances after her_]
     **Martin:** Oh, Eddie, it's breaking my heart seeing you like this.
     **Daphne:** How would a nice old batch of Grammy Moon's sugar biscuits 
             sound?
    **Frasier:** Do you honestly believe he can understand a word you're 
             saying?
     **Martin:** Hey, I read somewhere that dogs can understand up to four 
             hundred words.  Now, a super-smart dog like Eddie probably 
             knows a thousand.
    **Frasier:** Oh really, Dad! 
     **Martin:** Eddie understands a helluva lot more than you give him 
             credit for.
     **Daphne:** Yes.  Why, just yesterday I said, "Eddie, I've lost my keys" 
             [_Eddie looks up_] and he looked up at me...
    
    _EDDIE'S P.O.V.
    We then see the world through Eddie's eyes.  The picture is in black 
    and white.  He hears Daphne sounding a high pitched "mini-mini", 
    Frasier sounding a low "yadda, yadda, yadda" and Martin a "Yaka, Yaka". 
    However, every time one of them says "Eddie" it comes through clearly. 
    Then back in normal vision:_
    
    **Frasier:**...anything other than the simple fact of his name or a grunt!
      **Niles:**[_enters without the dog:_] Well, crisis has passed.  She just 
             needed a little rest.  Fortunately I remembered to bring her 
             sleep mask.
    
    _Martin gives Frasier a look but Frasier calms him._
    
     **Martin:** Worse, I'm afraid we're going to have bring in one of those 
             dog psychiatrists.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you can't be serious?
     **Martin:** Well, I'm desperate, we've tried everything else.
      **Niles:** A dog psychiatrist?
    **Frasier:** Honestly, Dad, they are the very definition of charlatanism! 
      **Niles:** You simply cannot apply the principals of human psychology 
             to animal behaviour. 
    **Frasier:** Precisely.  Animals operate out of instinct, whereas human 
             beings can reason.
      **Niles:** Yes.
    **Frasier:** They can cogitate.
      **Niles:** Yes.  Therefore human beings, through analytical 
             psychotherapy, can...
    
    _MARTIN'S P.O.V.
    Now we see the world through Martin's eyes.  Similar to Eddie but in 
    colour: Niles and Frasier take nonsensical gibberish and all Martin 
    can process is the word "dad."
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Radio Station.
    Frasier presses a button as we return to his radio show._
    
    **Frasier:** Thank you for staying with us through the first commercial 
             break.  We're talking to Alice, who has a case of the blues 
             today.  In order to help her through it I am relating a story 
             from my own life.  Any questions so far, Alice?
      **Alice:**[_v.o:_] Well, I was wondering, what happened to Roz and the 
             gynecologist?
    
    _Roz gives Frasier a stare._
    
        **Roz:** Well, since Frasier did tell the most embarrassing part of the 
             story, something kinda funny did happen...
    
    _CUT TO: Caf e Nervosa.
    Stephen Kagen and Roz are on their coffee date at the front table._
    
        **Roz:**[_to Kagen:_] Oh my God, you're kidding!  You were at Camp
             Lakebridge too.  What years were you there?
    **Frasier:**[_v.o:_] Roz! 
    
    _CUT TO: Radio Station.
    Frasier is interrupting the story._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, we are trying to help this woman.  We don't have time 
             for your pointless tangents. [_then:_] Anyway, my father 
             finally got his way and made his appointment for the dog 
             psychiatrist, who insisted that the entire household be 
             present for the first session.
    _FLASHBACK TO:
    
    Scene Five - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier, Daphne, Niles and Martin are on the set._
    
     **Martin:** What's keeping this guy?  He should have been here be now!
    **Frasier:** Perhaps he's being detained by his fear of fetching group.
    
    _Frasier and Niles laugh._
    
     **Martin:**[_waves cane:_] All right now, you two cut it out!
    _The doorbell sounds and Martin answers it.  Dr. Shaw is standing there 
    who is old, bald and thus the stereotypical "straight and strict" man._
       **Shaw:** Hello, I'm Dr. Arnold Shaw.
     **Martin:** Hi Doc, Marty Crane.  Come on in, please.  This is Daphne 
             Moon.
     **Daphne:** Hello.
     **Martin:** And my sons, Frasier and Niles. [_they greet him_] And this, 
             of course, is the patient.
    **Frasier:** I don't suppose whether my father told you, but my brother 
             and I happen to be psychiatrists.
       **Shaw:** Oh, how nice, I always enjoy being in the company of 
             colleagues.
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, did you say "colleagues" or "Collies?"
    
    _Niles and Frasier laugh, no one else does._
    
    **Frasier:** It's a joke.
       **Shaw:**[_simple:_] Very clever, very clever.  So, shall we begin? [_to 
             Eddie:_] Hello Eddie, I'm Dr. Shaw.  And I'm here to get to 
             know you and help you get better.  You're very sad, aren't 
             you?  It's okay to be sad, sometimes I'm sad too.  We're going 
             to spend the next hour trying to figure out why you're sad.
    **Frasier:** Give a dog an hour, you can bill him for seven!
       **Shaw:** I'm sorry, I get the feeling that some of us aren't taking 
             this seriously.
    **Frasier:** I apologise, it all just seems a bit silly.
       **Shaw:** Oh, really?  Silly?  I'll have you know I just attended the 
             funeral of one Buttons MacFahrlen whose owners felt the same 
             way.
    
    _Niles and Frasier begin laughing but Martin waves his stick at him 
    again.  They apologise and the doctor carries on._
    
       **Shaw:** First, I'd like to administer a dog personality profile 
             quiz-
     **Martin:** Oooh!
       **Shaw:** -I developed.  My first questions are based on how you think 
             Eddie might behave if he were a human being.
    **Frasier:** Oh, boy!
     **Daphne:**[_whisper to boys:_] Shush, this is not a joke!  This is very 
             serious.
       **Shaw:** If human Eddie were planning a dinner party, what might he 
             serve?
     **Martin:** I'd say meatloaf.  But not the plain kind, but the one with 
             the fancy tomato soup glaze on top.
      **Niles:** It might be a bit under done though, he has trouble reaching 
             the knobs on the stove!
     **Daphne:**[_pause_] Poached salmon.  I don't know why!
       **Shaw:** Interesting.  Question two: What do you imagine human Eddie's 
             first words to be?
    **Frasier:** Well, I hope: Give me a breath mint! [_laughs_] I'm sorry, I'm 
             sorry.  Right, next one.
       **Shaw:** What do you imagine would be human Eddie's favourite 
             cologne?
     **Martin:** Aqua Velva, it's a little strong but I think he can pull 
             it off.
     **Daphne:**[_pause_] Grey Flannel.  I don't know why!
    **Frasier:** Cologne?  Well, actually I think he would prefer toilet 
             water!
      **Niles:** By the way, same answer for favourite beverage!
    
    _Niles and Frasier laugh and do a little high-five motion dance._
    
       **Shaw:** I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm sorry but I don't see the point.  What is any of 
             this telling you about Eddie?
       **Shaw:** The point was not to learn about Eddie but was to learn 
             about all of you and might I say... [_looks at the brothers_] 
             mission accomplished!  Well, perhaps now would be a good 
             time for me to examine Eddie one on one.  Is there a room 
             I can use?
     **Martin:** Oh yeah, my room, second on the right.
       **Shaw:** Eddie, after you.  This may take a while.
    
    _Eddie exits and the doctor follows.  Then out of the blue:_
    
     **Daphne:** If Eddie were one of the Beatles, I think he'd be George.  
             I don't know why! [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** And yet she's never been committed.  I don't know why!
    
    _End Of Act One. (Time: 12:00)
    
    Act Two._
    
    **HAPPY TALK**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    Frasier, Niles, Daphne and Martin are hanging around waiting for 
    Dr. Shaw and Eddie to come out of their session._
    
    **Frasier:** Okay, I'll say it.  What the hell have they been doing in 
             there for the past hour?
     **Martin:** Well, he's probably just talking to him.  Eddie happens to 
             be very complex and interesting.
    **Frasier:** Oh yes, you must remind me to sit beside him at his next 
             dinner party.
      **Niles:** Well, be prepared, he'll be up and down checking on that 
             meatloaf!
    
    _Dr. Shaw and Eddie enter the room.  Eddie sits back, depressed, in 
    his same old spot on Martin's chair._
    
       **Shaw:** Well, I have my diagnosis.
    **Frasier:** Finally: the white smoke!
       **Shaw:** Eddie is indeed depressed.  Now if, as you say, there has 
             been no change in his routine, I can only surmise that he's 
             reacting to someone else's unhappiness.  Is anyone of you 
             suffering from depression?
    **Frasier:** Not me.
     **Daphne:** Well, I'm not depressed.
     **Martin:** Me, neither.
      **Niles:**[_grins_] I'm cheer personified.
       **Shaw:** Well, he's picking it up somewhere.  To be on the safe side 
             you should all be conscious of how you behave when you're in 
             front of him.  Try to speak in pleasant, happy, tones. [_to 
             Eddie:_] Goodbye, Eddie.  Call me in a few days, let me know 
             how he's doing.
     **Martin:**[_happy tone:_] Okay, thanks for everything, doc!
       **Shaw:** Sorry to rush off, but I have a four ? clock appointment at 
             the zoo.  There's a hyena there that won't even crack a 
             smile. [_then_] See, I can joke too!
    
    _Dr. Shaw exits and enters the lift as Roz quickly runs in._
    
        **Roz:** Hold it!
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, Roz, what's happened?
        **Roz:** I want to kill myself!
    
    _Martin quickly changes the tone._
    
     **Martin:**[_happily:_] Hey Roz, not in front of Eddie!
        **Roz:** What?
     **Daphne:**[_happily:_] That gentleman that just left was a dog 
             psychiatrist.
     **Martin:**[_happily:_] He said that it would be a good idea if we all 
             had a happy tone around Eddie.
      **Niles:**[_happily:_] So please tell us, why do you want to kill 
             yourself?
        **Roz:**[_happily:_] Well, I went out with Dr. Kagen and everything 
             was going so great that I almost forgot what he was.
     **Martin:**[_happily:_] What is he?
    **Frasier:**[_happily:_] A gynecologist.
     **Martin:**[_happily:_] Oh, geez, I don't think I want to hear any more 
             about this.
    _Martin takes himself and Eddie out to his bedroom as everyone reverts 
    to their normal tones._
    
    **Frasier:** All right, Roz, what happened?
        **Roz:** Well, we went upstairs to his apartment and he poured a 
             glass of wine, and well... do you know what a speculum is?
    
    _CUT TO: Radio Station.
    Frasier narrates the story._
    
    **Frasier:** Apparently he was an avid collector of antique gynecological 
             equipment.
    
    _Roz enters his booth and pours water all over him._
    
    **Frasier:** I just got the signal from Roz that we're running out of time.  
             So, I'll skip ahead in our story.
    _FLASHBACK TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Niles is playing the piano as Frasier pours himself a sherry.  Daphne 
    is gazing out on the streets of Seattle.  Roz is sat on the sofa and 
    Martin is fetching a can of beer._
    
    **Frasier:** If you ask me, the man's theory's a whole lot of hooey!  
             Who here has any reason to be unhappy?
     **Daphne:** Well, mind you I would never say this if it weren't for 
             Eddie's sake, [_to Niles:_] but comparatively speaking: Dr. 
             Crane, you have the most to be depressed about, what with 
             your separation from Mrs. Crane and all.
      **Niles:** Wha..?  I'm not unhappy.  Besides, I don't even live here.
     **Daphne:** Please, you're here more than I am.
    **Frasier:** You know, I hate to say it, but dad, if anyone's giving off 
             unhappiness, I'm afraid it's you.
     **Martin:** Me? 
    **Frasier:** Yes.
     **Martin:** You're the one who hasn't had a date in a year.  Not to 
             mention two failed marriages.
    **Frasier:** And yet you did.  Well, maybe I am not entirely happy.  Why 
             should I be?  My son lives across the country, there's no 
             woman in my life.  Maybe it is I that is making Eddie sad?
     **Daphne:** Oh, now, now, don't you take all the blame.  If I give my 
             life the once-over I realise it's not all jam.  I just lost 
             the only boyfriend I've had in years and the biggest thing 
             in my life is that I got all my hair cut off months ago and 
             no-one's even mentioned it.
    _They all start to say how nice it is, but Daphne clears the comments 
    away with her hands._
    
     **Daphne:** No, no.
      **Niles:** Daphne, maybe you were right earlier.  I'm not so happy.
     **Martin:** Or maybe it's me.  My life hasn't been a picnic since Hester 
             died.
        **Roz:** Now that I think about it, what have I got to be happy about?  
             I mean, I know it has nothing to do with Eddie, but maybe 
             Frasier picked up something from contact with me?
      **Niles:** He wouldn't be the first one... [_then:_] Oh, I'm too depressed!
    **Frasier:** How loosely woven is the fabric of our unhappiness... a tug 
             or two and it unravels to reveal how empty our everyday lives 
             really are.
      **Niles:** And then there are the empty nights... accompanied by thoughts 
             of loneliness and death.
     **Martin:** You think about that too?  I thought it was just me.
    **Frasier:** Everybody thinks about it.
     **Martin:** Do you lie real still and hold your breath and pretend 
             you're in the ground?
    **Frasier:** No, that's just you.
        **Roz:** When I die, I want it to be on my 100th birthday, in my 
             beach house on Maui and I want my husband to be so upset 
             that he has to drop out of college.
     **Daphne:** You know, I once had a psychic tell me the strangest thing. 
             That one day I'd go off my rocker, take up a kitchen knife, 
             kill the entire household and then kill myself.  Silly old 
             bag!  She was right about my moving to Seattle, though.
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know how I wanna go, but all those years around 
             the police morgue taught me a few things.  First off, you 
             don't want to swallow Drano or rat poison.  And if you're 
             going to kill yourself with an axe, get it right the first 
             time!
    **Frasier:** Well, you know, we can talk about it, we can think about it, 
             but nobody really knows how or when.
        **Roz:** One second we're alive as anyone else, and then what?
    **Frasier:** Darkness, nothingness, afterlife?
      **Niles:** I've always liked the notion of meeting the great figures of 
             history.  But then I think, what if it's like high school 
             and all the really cool dead people don't want to hang out 
             with me. [_carried away:_] Mozart'll tell me he's busy but then 
             later I'll see him out with Shakespeare and Lincoln!
     **Martin:** Well, I don't know about you but this is depressing the hell 
             out of me.  Remember, my bell's coming up sooner than you 
             guys!
    
    _They all agree and Martin is a little unnerved._
    
      **Niles:** No, no, none of us really knows when our time is up.
        **Roz:** And it's never long enough.  My great grandmother was 92 
             years old when she died and the last words to me from her 
             deathbed were, "it's so short."  Of course, it was the 
             seventies, she could have been talking about my skirt.
    **Frasier:** "I have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker."
      **Niles:** T.S Eliot.
    **Frasier:** Dead.
      **Niles:** "Must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death."
    **Frasier:** Plato.
      **Niles:** Even deader.
    **Frasier:** You know, perhaps Doctor Shaw was right.  Perhaps we are the 
             cause of Eddie's depression.
    _Frasier reaches behind him and pulls out one of Eddie's chew dolls he 
    was sitting on.  He throws it on the floor._
    
    **Frasier:** Simple beast!  It is here beneath the masks of happiness we 
             all wear.
    
    _As Frasier continues Eddie picks up the chew doll in his mouth and 
    begins happily playing with it.  They do not notice._
    
    **Frasier:** The sea that lurks below affected by our sorrows.  The once 
             care-free doggy world has been shattered, perhaps forever.
    
    _Martin notices the scene._
    
     **Martin:** Well, look at him, he's happy again.  Could that have been 
             all it was, he was missing his favourite doll?
    **Frasier:** I guess Dr. Shaw was wrong after all.  He wasn't taking his 
             cue from us, was he?
      **Niles:** Well, we were certainly taking a cue from Eddie.  I've never 
             been so depressed.
        **Roz:** Tell me about it!
     **Daphne:** Yeah, I wish I was a dog.  All it takes is a little toy to 
             make him happy again.
    **Frasier:** I'm afraid we're a bit more complex than that, Daphne.  We 
             know for whom the bell tolls!
    
    _They is a pause before suddenly a bell is heard.  Everyone tries to 
    process the sound._
    
     **Martin:**[_apprehensive_] Anybody else hear that?
     **Daphne:** Oh, the biscuits!
    **Frasier:** Daphne, by "biscuits" do you mean cookies?
     **Daphne:** Yeah, that's right!
     **Martin:** Smells good.
      **Niles:** Fresh from the oven...
        **Roz:** All nice and warm...
     **Daphne:** Yes, and I have a fresh pitcher of milk for dipping!
    **Frasier:** Oh, and I believe there's ice cream too!
    
    _Everyone gleams with delight and skips off to the kitchen.
    
    DISSOLVE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Radio Station.
    Frasier is finishing his story._
    
    **Frasier:** So Alice, even the happiest of us can find reasons to be 
             unhappy if only we look for them.  So don't look for them. 
             Take a tip from our dog friends - treat yourself to your 
             favourite toy, whatever that might be.
      **Alice:** I'll do that right now.  Thank you, Dr. Crane, I really do 
             feel better.
    **Frasier:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane, reminding everyone that life is 
             too short to dwell on every bump in the road.  Try to take 
             pleasure in the simple things.  In short, eat a cookie!
    
    _He takes a cookie from a nearby bowl, and then presses a button to 
    sign off before biting into it.  However, he screams and drops it to 
    the floor._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, walnut, I broke a tooth!  Now I've got to go to the 
             dentist, he'll tell me I haven't flossed, my lips are going 
             to get all fat - oh, my life sucks!
    
    _He leaves with his briefcase.
    
    End Of Act Two. (Time: 21:00)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Cafe Nervosa.
    A girl is sat talking to Dr. Kagen.  He gets up to fetch her a drink. 
    Whilst he's away Roz taps her on her shoulder and explains the doctor's 
    little secret.  The girl quickly gets up and leaves with Roz as Kagen 
    comes back to an empty seat._
