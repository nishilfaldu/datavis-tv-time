## Transcript {Andrea Day}

    
    
    _Act One
    
    Scene One - A Seedy Motel Room.
    Frasier is lying in bed, asleep, in the motel room.  He awakens and 
    finds that he has a tattoo on his arm that reads "Chesty."  There is 
    a half-empty bottle of tequila on a table across from the bed.  A 
    shower is running, but then stops suddenly.  Frasier props himself up 
    on some pillows and folds him arms behind his head, expectantly.  
    
    Out from the bathroom steps Gil Chesterton - wearing only a towel._
        **Gil:** Well, look who's up!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    Frasier sits up in bed - his own bed.  The previous scene had been a 
    dream - or a nightmare, considering Frasier's panic-stricken reaction.
    
    FADE OUT_
    **WHY GIL?  WHY NOW?**
    _Scene Two - KACL.
    Frasier is listening to a young male caller, Jimmy._
      **Jimmy:**[_v.o._] So it's my parents.  I don't know, they're just like, 
             really stupid.
    **Frasier:**[_bored_] May I ask how old you are?
      **Jimmy:** Fourteen.
    **Frasier:** Well, hang on, Jimmy.  Your parents are going to be stupid 
             for another seven years.
      **Jimmy:** Whoa!  Seven years?  That's like, longer than I'll be in high 
             school!
    **Frasier:** I salute your optimism. [_disconnects_] We'll be right back 
             after this. 
    _He goes off air as Roz enters his booth._
    **Frasier:** Oh god, Roz.  A teenager who's embarrassed by his parents?  
             I mean, please.  Can't you come up with something a little 
             more challenging for me?
        **Roz:** Well, it was either him or our old pal, Rudy the Crier.
    **Frasier:** Oh, Rudy the Crier.  Oh God.  He's been on three times in 
             the last month.  You put him on again, he won't be the only 
             one who's crying.  God, I'm in a dry spell.  Where are the 
             souls in genuine torment?  The people teetering on the brink 
             of genuine despair?
        **Roz:** Oh, they'll be back.  The holidays are just around the corner.
    **Frasier:** Well, perhaps you're right.  Oh, Roz, I've got a question 
             I'd like to ask you.
        **Roz:** Shoot.
    **Frasier:** Have you ever had a recurring dream of an intimate nature 
             about someone... oh, a... well, a co-worker?
        **Roz:**[_disgusted_] Oh, no.  Why'd you tell me? 
    **Frasier:** Oh, Roz!
        **Roz:** Oh, now it's gonna be creepy everytime you look at me 
             through the glass! 
    **Frasier:** Roz, not you!
        **Roz:**[_intrigued_] So who is it then? 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm not going to go into the specifics.
        **Roz:** Gina in accounting?
    **Frasier:** Look, I'm not gonna do this!
        **Roz:** Sheila, the slow intern?
    **Frasier:** Forget I even mentioned it.
    _Gil enters.  He's hiding something behind his back._
        **Gil:** Knock knock...
    **Frasier:**[_suddenly nervous_] Gil? [_Roz eyes Frasier suspiciously_]
        **Gil:** Frasier, I've come to tempt you.
    **Frasier:**[_scared_] Really?
        **Gil:** I'm reviewing the new pastry chef at Chez Shea. [_reveals an 
             eclair_] And I quote: "His amaretto eclair is so sinful, it 
             will send you scurrying to your local padre for absolution."
    **Frasier:** Uh... no, thank you, Gil.  I'm on a diet.
        **Gil:** Oh, come now!  You know you want it...
    **Frasier:**[_jumping up_] Oh, no no no... I really don't! [_shoos Gil out 
             the door_] Off you go.  Bye-bye.
        **Roz:**[_excited_] Oh, my god!
    **Frasier:** What?
        **Roz:** It was Gil!
    **Frasier:** I never said that!
        **Roz:** Then why are you blushing?
    **Frasier:** Oh, don't be ridiculous!
        **Roz:** Your ears are turning bright red!
    **Frasier:** I am not blushing!
        **Roz:** You are!
    _Gil then knocks on one of the windows.  As they look at him he takes 
    a big bite out of the eclair.  Frasier hurriedly closes the blinds as 
    Roz laughs._
    **Frasier:** Still not blushing!
    _The scene DISSOLVES to another caller - Rudy the Crier._
       **Rudy:**[_v.o._] ...just lying there in the hospital bed.  She lifted 
             her head off the pillow, looked up and said, "I love you," 
             and then she was gone. [_cries_]
    **Frasier:** Rudy, stop crying.  We've gone over this before.  What was 
             our agreement about sad movies?
       **Rudy:** I shouldn't watch them. [_cries_]
    **Frasier:** Exactly.  Now go get a cool washcloth and try to bring down 
             the puffiness around your eyes.  Please... stay away from 
             sad or depressing things... which, at this moment, includes 
             listening to the Dr. Frasier Crane Show. [_disconnects_] Well, 
             let's shoot it to the news.  That's it for today.  This is 
             Dr. Frasier Crane. [_he goes off air and Roz enters_] Oh, my 
             God!  Well, close the record books.  That was just the 
             dullest three hours in the history of the Frasier Crane Show!
        **Roz:** Oh, come on.  It wasn't so bad.  What about that woman who 
             was so concerned about her appearance she wouldn't leave the 
             house?
    **Frasier:** That was a commercial!  I believe Miss Clairol solved the 
             problem!  Well, I'll see you tomorrow. [_he moves to exit, 
             then turns back_] Oh!  Oh, Roz... about that dream I mentioned 
             to you earlier... uh... this goes without saying, but I'd 
             rather you didn't share that with anyone else.
        **Roz:** Oh, sure. 
      **Betty:**[_passing by_] Hi, dreamboy!
    **Frasier:**[_to Roz_] I hate you!  Couldn't keep your big mouth shut, 
             could you?  Just exactly when did you find the time to 
             spread the news?
        **Roz:** You don't think I was listening to your show, do you?
    _Bulldog enters._
    **Bulldog:** Comin' through!  Oh, Doc... I got to rub this one in a 
             little...
    **Frasier:** All right, look, Bulldog... before you start to ridicule me, 
             yes, yes I had a dream about Gil.  And yes, it had some 
             erotic elements, but... [_notices Bulldog's surprised 
             expression_] You have absolutely no idea what I'm talking 
             about, do you?
    **Bulldog:** I do now!  Whoa! [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Look, let's just forget it.  What delightful little jibe did 
             you have prepared for me? 
    **Bulldog:** Oh, I was gonna tell you your show today just broke the 
             snooze meter, but now I want to hear about you greasin' 
             Gil's cookie sheet! [_honks horn_]
    **Frasier:** I'm on a bus to Hell. 
    _FADE TO:_
    **PSYCHIATRIST...CRANE...
    FRASIER...NILES...IDIOTS**
    
    _Scene Three - Cafe Nervosa. 
    Frasier and Niles are standing at the counter.  Niles is relaying a 
    story to a bored Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** So I returned to the dry-cleaners yet a third time.  I hardly 
             need to tell you how the story ends.
    **Frasier:** Just tell me _when_ the story ends.
      **Niles:**[_miffed_] Fine.  They realigned my pleats, The End.
    **Frasier:** Sorry, Niles. [_they get their coffees and sit at a nearby 
             table_] I'm just a bit distracted today.  You see, this 
             morning, a... a man from my building approached me with a 
             very intriguing problem.  It seems he's been having a 
             recurring dream.
      **Niles:** Oh, please.  That little gambit didn't work when we were in 
             knee socks.  What was your dream, Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Oh, all right!  It's been tormenting me.  I haven't been able 
             to sleep in weeks now.  It's a bit hazy but... it starts out 
             in a seedy motel room.  I'm naked.
      **Niles:** Interesting.
    **Frasier:** Yes, well... I roll over and discover on my forearm a tattoo:
             the word "Chesty." 
      **Niles:** Interesting.
    **Frasier:** Then the shower turns off and out from the bathroom steps... 
             a man. [_pause_] All right, go ahead, let me have it!
      **Niles:** Are you saying that now, or is that a quote from the dream?
    **Frasier:**[_annoyed_] Please?  We're both too intelligent to waste time 
             on the obvious interpretation. 
      **Niles:** Yes.  But you must admit, it's rather intriguing. [_chuckles_]
    **Frasier:** Would you stop?  It's obviously screaming for a Jungian 
             interpretation.  The sexuality in the dream is surely 
             symbolic of some deeper, non-sexual conflict.
      **Niles:** All right.
    _Gil approaches the table with a smug grin on his face._
         **Gil:** Good afternoon, Frasier.
     **Frasier:** Gil.
         **Gil:** A little birdie tells me I was featured in your midnight 
              movie. 
     **Frasier:** That's very clever.  Off you go.
         **Gil:** Very well.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Or should I say, "See 
              you in your dreams"? [_exits_]
       **Niles:** In this dream of yours, were there any cigars, bananas or 
              short, blunt swords?
     **Frasier:** Would you stop it?!  I'm 43 - a little late for latency. 
    _Rebecca, the waitress, comes over._
    **Rebecca:** You guys okay over here?
      **Niles:** Oh, we're fine.
    **Frasier:**[_flirting_] Well... you must be new here.  I surely would 
             have remembered such a pretty face as yours.
      **Niles:** You're overcompensating.
    **Frasier:** Right.  We're fine.  Bye-bye. [_she leaves_] I'm just baffled, 
             Niles.  Obviously, Gil Chesterton explains "Chesty" but 
             little else. 
      **Niles:** Perhaps you should tackle this from a free-association 
             standpoint.
    **Frasier:** God, must we?
      **Niles:** Well, now... focus on any detail in the motel room.  
             What's the first thing that pops into your mind?
    **Frasier:** Uh... a crescent-shaped lamp.
      **Niles:** Perfect - crescent-shaped lamp.  Run with that. 
             Crescent... moon... Daphne Moon... French maid... brass 
             bed... satin robe...
    **Frasier:** Niles!  This is my dream!
      **Niles:** I was just showing you the process.
    **Frasier:** You were three words away from a cigarette! 
      **Niles:**[_outraged_] Your turn!
    **Frasier:** All right.
      **Niles:** Crescent lamp.
    **Frasier:** Crescent... croissant... butter... apricot jam... hunger... 
             food... diet!  My God, I've been on a diet.  Do you think 
             that's useful?
      **Niles:** You could stand to lose a few pounds.
    **Frasier:** Just wait a minute.  Gil is a restaraunt critic - a gourmet. 
             Perhaps he's symbolic of the food I've been denying myself. 
      **Niles:** That would explain why you're naked in the dream.  It's when 
             we're naked that we're most self-conscious about our bodies.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and most vulnerable to the way society "tattoos" us 
             with labels about our appearance!  God, that's it, Niles! 
             The dream is simply telling me that I've been too rigid
             about my diet! 
      **Niles:** Well, you'll know tonight.  If this is the correct 
             interpretation, the conflict will have passed from 
             your unconscious to your conscious mind. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, the dream will have served its purpose. 
      **Niles:** And you will no longer be plagued by it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, God, Niles.  I've nailed it all right.  I really have. 
             Finally, for the first time in weeks they'll be no tequila 
             bottles, no tattoo, no half-naked man in my bed. [_he looks 
             up to see Rebecca standing at their table_] So then, the 
             Rabbi says...
    _FADE TO: 
    
    Scene Four - The Motel Room.
    Once again, Frasier is in bed.  The tequila bottle is still there, 
    and he still has the tattoo.  The shower turns off and out from the 
    bathroom steps a rather buxom woman wearing only a towel.  Frasier 
    looks pleasantly surprised._
      **Woman:** Oh, I'm sorry... wrong room. [_leaves_]
    _Frasier's expression turns to disappointment.  Gil suddenly appears 
    lying next to Frasier in bed._
        **Gil:** That does it.  We're finding another motel.
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    Frasier again wakes up from his dream in a panic.  He notices something 
    under the covers next to him.  He cautiously pulls back the covers to 
    reveal Eddie.  He isn't any more pleased about this.
    
    End of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - The elevator at the Elliot Bay Towers.
    Daphne and Martin are in the back of the elevator.  The doors open and 
    a woman gets on, standing in front of Daphne and Martin.  Daphne says 
    hello and they lapse into silence for a moment.  She and Martin then 
    begin to speak to each other in a conspiratorial tone._
     **Daphne:** Someone followed me again last night.
     **Martin:** Ah, you're just being paranoid.
     **Daphne:** I'm telling you, they're onto me.
     **Martin:** Come on.  Nobody could recognize you after all that plastic 
             surgery.
    _The woman becomes alarmed at this._
     **Daphne:** That's what Marlena thought.
     **Martin:** Marlena got sloppy.  She never should have gone back to 
             Zurich.
     **Daphne:** I just don't want any more bloodshed.
     **Martin:** Relax.  You're home free.
     **Daphne:** You don't know the Woodchuck and his ways.
    _The doors open and the woman rushes out in fear.  Martin and Daphne 
    break down laughing._
     **Daphne:** Oh, we're terrible!
     **Martin:** We are?  You are!  "The Woodchuck and his ways"?
     **Daphne:** You know, we really should stop doing this.  It's not nice.
     **Martin:** Ah, you're right.  We won't do it anymore.
    _The doors open and a man enters._
     **Daphne:**[_as soon as the doors close, to Martin_] How'd you get the 
             stuff through Customs?
     **Martin:** They never check the wooden leg.
    _CUT TO: Frasier's apartment.  Frasier is pacing the living room as 
    Niles sits at the couch, poring over psychology textbooks._
    **Frasier:** The answer has got to be in there somewhere!
      **Niles:** Here's something. [_reads_] "Dreams as an expression of wish 
             fulfillment."
    **Frasier:**[_grabs the book_] Moving on.
    _Daphne and Martin enter._
     **Daphne:** Goodness, are you two still here?
     **Martin:** What are you working on?
    **Frasier:** Nothing.
      **Niles:** I'm helping Frasier interpret a dream he's been having.  
             You know, maybe Dad can help. 
    **Frasier:**[_alarmed_] No, no, no... don't want to bore Dad with the
             details of this particular dream.
      **Niles:** Dreams can be rooted in childhood experience.  Maybe Dad 
             remembers something you've repressed. 
     **Martin:** Gee, I don't know.  If it's about when you were a kid I've 
             repressed a lot of that myself. [_exits to the kitchen_]
    **Frasier:** Niles, this is not a dream I wish to share with Dad, thank 
             you very much.
      **Niles:** Well, we've exhausted every other interpretation.  So, 
             I guess it's back to dreams as wish fulfillment...
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad... [_he moves to the kitchen where Martin is making a 
             sandwich_] Would you mind listening to my dream to see if it 
             conjures up any memories from my childhood?
     **Martin:** Oh, come on.  You're making too much out of this.  It's a 
             dream.  Dreams are weird.
    **Frasier:** Please, Dad.  I wouldn't ask if it weren't really bothering
             me.
     **Martin:** Well, all right... go on.
    **Frasier:** All right... it starts out in a little motel room.  I have a 
             tattoo on my arm - "Chesty"...
     **Martin:** See?  That's weird.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Then out from the bathroom steps a... All right, now 
             before I continue, let me remind you that this is a dream. 
             Not to be confused with reality. [_Martin nods, still busy 
             with his sandwich_] Out from the bathroom steps a man... [_off 
             Martin's concerned expression_] -eating lion!
     **Martin:**[_relieved_] Oh, see?  There again, weird.  Look, dreams come, 
             they go.  They don't mean anything.  Except, you know, if 
             you're lucky, every once in awhile you might have one that's 
             a lot of fun.  Like, you hit a home run in the World Series
             or you're in the jungle with Jayne Mansfield and she gets 
             bit by a snake. 
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad.
     **Martin:** You know who Jayne Mansfield is, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad.
     **Martin:** You know what you do when you're bit by a snake, don't you?
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad. [_leaves_]
     **Martin:**[_to himself_] Wish I knew what I had for dinner that night.
    _Frasier enters the living room to find Niles and Daphne on the 
    couch, chatting about Frasier's dream._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I get it.  Chesty refers to Gil Chesterton.
    **Frasier:** Niles, you gossipy fishwife!
     **Daphne:**[_standing_] There's no reason to feel self-conscious, Dr. 
             Crane.  We've all had dreams like that.  I had one about a 
             girl I shared a flat with once - a gymnast. 
      **Niles:**[_standing_] Go on, Daphne.  This could be significant.
     **Daphne:** Well, I remember we were doing stretches in the gymnasium, 
             when suddenly we decided to take off all our clothes and go 
             for a bounce on the trampoline. [_giggles_] The next thing you 
             know, I'm chasing her around the pommel horse.  Oh, never 
             mind...
      **Niles:**[_aroused_] Don't stop now! [_off their looks_] This could help 
             us. [_sits_]
     **Daphne:** Well, actually, I do have a theory of my own about your 
             dream, if you'd like to hear it.
    **Frasier:** What the hell.
     **Daphne:** Well... in your dream, who was in the shower?  Gil.  What is 
             a shower?  Running water.  Who needs water?  Fish.  What do 
             fish have?  Gills!  Do you see where I'm going?
    **Frasier:** Insane?
     **Daphne:** It could be a dream about the loss of a beloved childhood 
             pet.
     **Martin:**[_entering from the kitchen with Eddie_] Thanks a lot, Eddie. 
             Forty-five minutes in the park, you don't have to go.  I get 
             one bite into my sandwich and you give me the look. 
     **Daphne:** Mr. Crane, did Dr. Crane ever have a goldfish growing up?
     **Martin:** A fish?
     **Daphne:** Yes, as a pet.
     **Martin:** How would I know?  That was Hester's department. [_to Eddie_] 
             Come on, let's go. [_leaves_]
      **Niles:** Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
    **Frasier:** That Dad can interpret the looks from his dog and has only 
             the spottiest recollections of our childhoods?
      **Niles:** No.  No, no, no.  Hester - Hesty.  The tattoo - that's only 
             one letter away from Chesty!
    **Frasier:** Niles, are you saying that the dream could have been about 
             mother?
      **Niles:** Well?
    **Frasier:** I suppose I could have misread the tattoo. [_rolls up his 
             shirt sleeve_] Yes, yes... this freckle pattern here on my 
             arm could be mistaken for a "C."
     **Daphne:** And what swims in the sea?  Fish! [_off their looks_] All 
             right, all right I'll go. [_exits to her room_]
      **Niles:** Well, so the tattoo could have said "Hesty."  But the problem 
             is, I don't ever remember Dad calling her that.
    **Frasier:** But who's to say he didn't? 
    _They both gasp and run to the elevator, where Martin is still 
    waiting with Eddie._
       **Both:** Dad, Dad... Dad, Dad!
     **Martin:** What?
    **Frasier:** Did you ever have a nickname for Mother?
     **Martin:** Oh, for God's sakes!  Is this to do with that stupid dream?
    **Frasier:** Dad, this is really important!
      **Niles:** Any pet name?  A term of endearment?
     **Martin:** Well... when we were first married I used to call her 
             "Honey."  And then... there was a time after that that I 
             started calling her "Sweetie."
    **Frasier:** I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote behind each one of 
             those.  But did you ever call her "Hesty"?
     **Martin:** "Hesty"?
    **Frasier:**[_forcefully_] Oh, come on, think, man!  Even once!  Once, in 
             all the years you lived together?!
     **Martin:**[_nervously_] We-Well... I don't know. [_elevator doors open_] I-
             I guess...
    **Frasier:** Really?
     **Martin:** Yeah, maybe once... [_stumbles into the elevator, disturbed_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, thank you Dad! [_doors close_] Well, there it is!  I must 
             have heard him call her "Hesty" once and neatly tucked it 
             away into my subconscious.
      **Niles:** Of course, it's so obvious!  Gil is a food critic.  Food, 
             criticism...
       **Both:** Mother!
      **Niles:** It's the classic Oedipal dream!
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes... only I was so frightened by my sexual urges to 
             be with my mother that I transformed her into a man! Oh, 
             what a relief!  I've been wringing my hands over nothing.  
             I mean, it's okay.  All I want to do is have sex with my 
             dead mother!
    _Frasier turns to see that a woman has been standing by the elevator 
    doors and has overheard him.  He sheepishly enters his apartment.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Six - the Motel Room.
    The scene reveals a painting of bananas and swords above the bed 
    where Frasier is sleeping.  He awakens to find the tattoo of "Chesty" 
    still on his arm and the sound of the shower running.  He is 
    exasperated.  The shower stops and he turns to the bathroom door with 
    a look of apprehension._
    **Frasier:** Mom?  Mommy?
        **Gil:**[_entering_] Patience, Daddy!
    _SMASH CUT TO:
    Frasier again wakes up from his dream in a panic and switches on the 
    light in his bedroom.
    
    FADE TO:_
    **THANK GOD HE WAS WRONG
    ABOUT THAT "MOTHER" THING**
    _Scene Two - Frasier's apartment.
    The middle of the night.  Frasier is poring over textbooks at the 
    kitchen table.  Martin enters from his bedroom, groaning._
     **Martin:** You'd think by now I'd know better than to have that third 
             Slim Jim before going to bed.  Couldn't sleep either, huh?
    **Frasier:** No.  Frankly, I'm sort of afraid to go back to sleep.  
             It's that damn dream again.
     **Martin:** Oh, what are you worried about?  It's just a dream.  
             Worst case scenario - the man-eating lion leaps on 
             top of you and mauls you.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Dad, I wasn't completely truthful with you before.  
             The dream is really about me in a motel room with a male 
             companion, Gil Chesterton.
     **Martin:** You don't care if I ever sleep again, do you? 
    _He absentmindedly turns on the TV.  Frasier turns it off behind him._
    **Frasier:** Dad, please, I'd really like to discuss this!
     **Martin:** No, Frasier, please.  This makes me very uncomfortable. 
             [_he enters the kitchen with Frasier following him_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, please...
     **Martin:** I know, I know... in your generation, men talk about 
             everything.  Everything's out in the open. [_he begins to 
             nervously clean the refrigerator and countertop, avoiding 
             eye contact_] You know what really drives me crazy is the way 
             you all touch each other.  Everybody hugs, you know?  In my 
             generation it was a... a handshake.  That was good enough. 
             Maybe if you felt especially close to someone you'd touch 
             him on the shoulder, but never for more than two seconds. 
             And don't talk to me about football players patting people's 
             butts and everything, because that's different - that's 
             sports, that's like war.  Now, goodnight, son. [_exits to 
             the living room_]
    **Frasier:** Dad...!
     **Martin:** Look, if you want to tell me something, write it on a post-
             it and stick it on the fridge.
    **Frasier:** Look, I really want to talk about this! [_Martin finally 
             stops and faces Frasier_] I've exhausted every other possible 
             interpretation of this dream.  Is it possible my subconscious 
             is trying to tell me something about my sexuality?
     **Martin:** Oh, that's ridiculous!
    **Frasier:** Is it?  I was sensitive as a child; I didn't go in for sports.  
             God, it's every cliche in the book.  Surely it must have 
             occurred to you at some point?  You refused to take me to see 
             "West Side Story" on my eighth birthday.
     **Martin:** Well, because of the gangs.  That's scary for kids.
    **Frasier:** Even gangs that dance?
     **Martin:** Especially gangs that dance! [_then_] All right.  Yeah... okay, 
             yeah, I thought about it.  But no, Frasier, no... I don't 
             believe that.  And you know why?  Because you would have 
             known by now.  Your unconscious or whatever the hell you 
             call it could no more have kept its yap shut than the rest 
             of you. 
    **Frasier:** I suppose you're right. 
     **Martin:** Yeah.  Now, come on, it's after 3:00.  You're gonna be all 
             worn out before your show tomorrow. 
    **Frasier:** What a tragedy that would be.
     **Martin:** Now what are you complaining about?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I don't know.  I just haven't had any really interesting 
             calls lately.  I'm beginning to question whether I'm not 
             bored with psychiatry. [_sits at the table_]
     **Martin:** Boy, you'd never know it with the way you got your nose 
             stuck in all those books.
    **Frasier:** That's true.  The one saving grace about this dream is it's 
             given me a chance to flex my analytical muscle a bit.
     **Martin:** Ah, maybe it wasn't so bad after all.
    **Frasier:** Wait a minute.  Could that be what this has been all about? 
             I've been so intellectually unchallenged lately by my show 
             that my mind had to create a dream that defies 
             interpretation just to give me a challenge? 
     **Martin:** I don't know.  Keep talking, you're making me sleepy.
    **Frasier:** Dad, no... that's got to be it! [_stands_] My show hasn't 
             provided me with a single patient worthy of my skills and I 
             had to invent one myself - me!  Oh, God!  What a relief.  At 
             last, finally, to bed.  Dad, you've witnessed an epiphany! 
             [_they move to the hall_]
     **Martin:** Yeah, God, I got to get you to put this on tape.
    **Frasier:**[_o.s._] Off we go.  To sleep, perchance NOT to dream.
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - The Motel Room.
    Frasier is once again lying in the bed, asleep.  He awakens to find 
    the tattoo is now gone and there is no more tequila bottle.  He sits 
    up and listens for the shower.  Hearing nothing, he lies back, 
    relieved.  Suddenly, there is a knock on the door.  Frasier sits up 
    in surprise and says "Come in."  A man enters, the psychiatrist Dr. 
    Siegmund Freud._
      **Freud:** Dr. Crane, Dr. Siegmund Freud.
    **Frasier:** Oh, my goodness! [_they shake hands_] It's quite an honor! 
      **Freud:** The honor is all mine.  I gave you a complex psychological 
             problem and you solved it.  You are a brilliant psychiatrist.
    **Frasier:** Oh, that's very flattering.  You know, there are so many 
             things I'd like to ask you!
      **Freud:** In good time, my boy.  In good time.  Right now, we have 
             more important matters. 
    _He takes out some breath freshener and sprays it into his mouth.  
    To Frasier's astonishment, Freud then climbs into bed with Frasier 
    and lies back, spreading out his arms for an embrace.
    
    CUT TO: an exterior shot of Frasier's apartment building, where we see 
    a lone light switch on at the 19th floor.  It appears Frasier is in 
    for another sleepless night._
    [_N.B.  For you Frasier trivia buffs, this is the only time Frasier's 
    apartment has been shown from an exterior point of view._] 
    _End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    The clock reveals that's it's 3:10 a.m.  Eddie is in the kitchen, 
    hopping up and down, trying to grab a muffin on the kitchen counter. 
    It is then revealed that Eddie was asleep on the couch, having his 
    own dream.  He jumps down from the couch and rushes to the kitchen.  
    He begins to hop up and down to get a muffin, only there aren't any.  
    He finally sulks back to the living room and lies back down, defeated.
