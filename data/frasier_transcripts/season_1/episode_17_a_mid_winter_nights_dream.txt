## Reviews

    
    
    Nicholas Hartley: This is the first ever Niles and Daphne
     teaser episode and it wonderful.  Some highlights are the "burning
     with the heat of a thousands suns" speech, the Niles and Daphne Cafe
     Nervosa scene and Eddie listning to the answering machine.  Truly
     brilliant season one episode. A+.

    _ACT ONE_
    
    _Scene One - Cafe Nervosa
    Niles and Frasier are sat at a table together.  Niles is ordering his 
    coffee from Eric the waiter but Frasier just can't seem to get his._
    
      **Niles:** Double Cappuccino, half-caf, not-fat milk, with just enough
             foam to be aesthetically pleasing but not so much that it 
             leaves a moustache. 
       **Eric:** Cinnamon or chocolate on that?
      **Niles:** Oh, they make this so complicated.  Um, cinnamon.
       **Eric:**[_to Frasier:_] And you?
    **Frasier:** Well let me see, I think I'll have the...
    
    _Daphne enters the cafe and goes to the counter._
    
      **Niles:** Oh look, it's Daphne.  Daphne!
    **Frasier:** Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Oh, hello, thought I might run into you here.  Oh please, 
             sit, sit.  I just stopped in for a bag of beans, we're 
             running low at home.
    **Frasier:** Oh, well good. [_to Eric:_] You know, I'd like... 
       **Eric:**[_intervening:_] I'd be happy to help.
     **Daphne:** Two pounds of...
       **Eric:**[_with Daphne:_] The Kenya Blend.
     **Daphne:** Ho-ho, you remembered.
       **Eric:** Hard to forget. [_Niles looks jealous._]
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, you haven't taken my order yet.
       **Eric:**[_ignoring Frasier:_] Most people find that blend too intense.
     **Daphne:** Not me, I like something that holds its body on my tongue.
    
    _Niles, seduced by the language, spills cream all over the table._
    
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, we seem to have spilled something here.  If you
             could... [_Eric just throws down a dishcloth._]
       **Eric:** I don't suppose you would be into something robust, if it
             didn't come on too strong. 
     **Daphne:** If it was a little bit sweet I might take a liking to it. 
       **Eric:** Would you like to step over to the counter and try my 
             special blend? 
     **Daphne:** I'd love to. 
    
    _They go to the counter._
    
    **Frasier:**[_shouting:_] Oh, nothing for me, thanks! 
      **Niles:** Frasier, that man is hitting on our Daphne!  I don't know 
             how she stands it.
    **Frasier:** Niles... look, apropos of nothing, how are things between you 
             and Maris?
      **Niles:** Are you implying that my concern for Daphne's welfare is
             anything less than pure?
    **Frasier:** I don't know, you tell me. 
      **Niles:** Frasier, that is your great shortcoming.  You're always
             distrustful, you're always suspicious.  Sometimes you just
             have to have faith that people are all right- [_spies on them_] 
             _what's he doing now!?_
    **Frasier:** I believe he's bagging her beans.
      **Niles:**[_interpreting this his own way_] Oh!
    
    _Daphne comes over, excited._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm so excited!  Eric over there is taking me to a club to 
             hear his band tonight.  Oh, I know it's not my regular night 
             off but I'll switch it with Saturday, if that's OK with you. 
             [_Niles shakes his head "no" at Frasier, who ignores him_] Oh, 
             isn't he lovely?  I already have a nickname for him, "Eric The 
             Red."  It favours him, doesn't it?  Don't you think he looks 
             like a Viking? 
    **Frasier:** Well...
     **Daphne:** Well, ta-ta! [_turns to leave, but stops_] Oh, look at me, 
             I forgot my beans.  Earth to Daphne! 
    
    _She runs out.  Niles is beside himself._
    
      **Niles:** How could she like him?  The man has "community college"
             written all over him. 
    **Frasier:** Niles, you know, this infatuation with Daphne is really 
             getting out of hand.  I didn't really mind when it was just a 
             flirtation, but I can't help wonder that this is symptomatic 
             of something wrong between you and Maris. [_Niles is silent_] 
             Well, is it?
      **Niles:** Oh... Frasier, I can't lie to you.  The truth is, Maris and I 
             are in a bit of a rut.  We seem to have lapsed into this grey, 
             numbing blandness.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's perfectly normal in a relationship of some years.
             Maybe you should try spicing things up a bit.
      **Niles:** You mean... boudoir-wise?
    **Frasier:** Well, for starters, yeah.
      **Niles:** Like how?
    **Frasier:** Well, the two of you could... [_Niles leans forward 
             expectantly_] Well, you could... well it's you and 
             Maris, so you could... I'm stumped. 
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene Two - KACL
    The next day, Frasier enters Roz's booth before his next radio show.
    Roz is stacking carts.  She's in a bit of a bad mood._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hi Roz, how are you?
        **Roz:** Do you really want to know how I am, or are you just making
             conversation?  Because if you really want to know how I am,
             I'll tell you. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I was just making conversation.  But actually, Roz, 
             there's some advice I need. 
        **Roz:** About what?
    **Frasier:** A subject in which you're quite well-versed, sex.
        **Roz:**[_losing all her troubles:_] How can I help you?
    **Frasier:** What do you do when... when the romance goes out of a 
             relationship?
        **Roz:** I get dressed and go home. 
    **Frasier:** All right, let's just assume for a moment that you are capable 
             of a long-term relationship; what would you do to keep things
             cooking?
        **Roz:** Well, once I had a boyfriend take me out to a bar, and we
             pretended we were strangers picking each other up.  Actually 
             that was kinda hot. [_chuckles at the memory_]
    **Frasier:** So you used, like, fantasy/role-playing?
        **Roz:** Yeah.  In fact, we had so much fun we tried it again.  Only 
             the next time he got so into it he went home with another
             woman. 
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry.
        **Roz:** Oh hell, she was gorgeous.  One more drink, and I'd have 
             gone home with her.  My point is that women need to see the 
             men they make love to as exciting, romantic figures.  So I 
             say, if you want to keep this woman interested, try creating 
             a fantasy for an evening.  Personally, I think you'd make a 
             very sexy gladiator.
    **Frasier:** Roz, this is not for me, it's for my brother Niles. 
        **Roz:** Oh!  Well in that case, make it a gladiola.
    _FADE TO:_
    **AHOY MATEY!**
    
    _Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
    It's late at night and everyone is fast asleep in the Crane household. 
    But someone is insistently ringing the doorbell.  Frasier rushes out
    of his bedroom, donning a dressing gown.  He turns on the lights and 
    looks through the peephole._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!
    
    _He opens the door to Niles, who is dressed in a long raincoat._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles!
      **Niles:** I'm sorry, Frasier, but something horrible has happened.  
             Maris kicked me out.
    **Frasier:** Dear God, why?  What for?
    _For answer, Niles takes his raincoat off, revealing pirate attire: 
    white puffy shirt, knee-high boots, and bright orange pantaloons 
    belted with a golden swash (plastic dagger included)._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, my.
     **Martin:**[_entering:_] What's going on out there?  Niles? 
      **Niles:** Hello, dad. 
    
    _Martin stares at him for a long beat._
    
     **Martin:** Never mind, I don't want to know.
      **Niles:** No dad, wait, there's a perfectly reasonably explanation
             for the way I'm dressed. 
    **Frasier:** Alright, just keep in mind that I reserve the right to say
             "stop" at any time.
      **Niles:** Well, my plan was to leave a treasure map downstairs for Maris 
             with clues that would lead her to my whereabouts.  Then I'd 
             hide in the linen closet and wait for her to find me. 
     **Martin:** Dressed like that?
      **Niles:** Actually no, at the time I was wearing only my eye-patch.
             Although, technically is it still an eye-patch if you're 
             wearing it on your-?
    **Frasier:** Stop!
      **Niles:** There I was lying in wait, with my little plastic knife 
             clenched between my teeth, when the closet door was flung 
             open and I found myself face to face with the upstairs maid.  
             She began screaming what I gather were some very unflattering 
             things in idiomatic Guatemalan, when Maris stumbled upon the 
             scene and completely misconstrued it.  The next thing I knew 
             she ordered me out of the house!  I barely had time to grab my 
             pantaloons and buckle my swash.
    
    _Martin bursts out laughing._
    
      **Niles:** Dad?  Dad, it's not funny.
     **Martin:** Where'd you come up with such a stupid idea?
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** All I suggested was some sexual role-playing, you're the one
             that came up with "Pirates of the Caribbean"!
      **Niles:**[_sinks into a chair_] Oh, I've really bungled it this time, 
             haven't I?
     **Martin:** Oh come on, these things happen.  Look, why don't you just 
             stay here tonight with us and then tomorrow you and Maris 
             can sort things out. 
      **Niles:** What if we don't?  What'll I do then?
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose they could always use another busboy at the 
             "Jolly Roger"!
    
    _Laughing, Frasier goes to the hall._
    
      **Niles:** I'll never be able to face the maid again.
     **Martin:** I don't think it's your face she'll remember. 
    
    _He laughs again.  Niles glares at him._
    
     **Martin:** Oh come on, Niles, everybody has an embarrassing story to 
             tell.  Did I ever tell you about the time I got locked 
             outside in the backyard in my underwear?
      **Niles:** Only every Thanksgiving. 
     **Martin:** Well, don't worry, I won't be telling that story this year!
    
    _He laughs a third time, causing Niles to throw his hands up and pace
    the room in exasperation._
    
    **Frasier:**[_entering with pillow and blanket:_] Here we are, Canadian
             goose down pillow, Egyptian cotton sheets and a nice Vicuna
             throw in case you get a little chilly during the night. 
      **Niles:** How perfect!
     **Martin:** I still say a couple of years in the service would have done
             you two boys a world of good.  Goodnight. [_he leaves_]
      **Niles:** Goodnight.  You know, Frasier, Maris and I have had our
             difficulties before, but never anything this serious.  I 
             really feel terrible having her mad at me.  It's times like 
             this I wish I knew how to cry.
    **Frasier:** Well, don't be embarrassed on my account, Niles. 
      **Niles:** No, no, it's not that, I'm just not someone who cries, it's 
             not in my nature.  When Maris's Uncle Lyle died, I had to 
             shut my hand in the car door just to make a decent showing 
             at the funeral. 
    **Frasier:** You're a complex little pirate, aren't you?  Well, goodnight
             Niles.
      **Niles:** Goodnight.
    _Frasier turns the lights out and leaves.  Niles lies on the couch but 
    yelps suddenly.  Removing a plastic hook from his belt, he gets comfy 
    again.
    
    Daphne and Eric come in from their date.  Niles hides under the 
    covers.  They don't notice him._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, thank you again, Eric.  I had a wonderful time.
       **Eric:** Me too. 
    
    _Niles peeks over the couch and sees Daphne and Eric kiss._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, Goodnight.
       **Eric:** Goodnight.
    _Niles hides again.  Daphne closes the door, leans against it, and 
    sighs.  She goes to her room.  It isn't long before Niles is in 
    floods of tears.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment.
    The following morning, Eric is the only thing Daphne's thinking 
    about as she's serving coffee to Frasier and Martin._
    
     **Daphne:** I know we've only had a few dates, but I'm already
             exhibiting the three signs of a woman in love: I can't stop
             thinking about him, I can't eat, and I bought myself all-new 
             underwear! [_exits to kitchen, giggling_]
     **Martin:** We gotta get her a girlfriend to talk to!
    
    _Frasier nods.  Niles enters in a dressing gown._
    
      **Niles:** I just got off the phone with Maris.  She's in Arizona for 
             the weekend.
    **Frasier:** Why?
      **Niles:** Well, she said she was so shattered by the experience she 
             had to fly to her favorite spa to contemplate the future of 
             our marriage from a mud bath.
     **Daphne:** Well, it'll probably be good for Mrs. Crane.  Eric thinks 
             the earth is very grounding.
      **Niles:** Eric, Eric, Eric!  Must everything always be about Eric?! 
    **Frasier:** Niles.  May I suggest that when Maris returns, you both 
             invest some time in some intensive couples' therapy.  
             There's a Reichian group...
     **Martin:** Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Look, all Maris needs to 
             know is that you love her.  Buy her some flowers, fix her a 
             nice romantic dinner when she gets back, that's enough to 
             make any woman forgive you.
      **Niles:** You really think that will work?
     **Martin:** If it didn't, you wouldn't be here!
      **Niles:** Well, I'd be willing to try, but it's impossible.  Our cook
             walked out in sympathy with Maris. 
     **Daphne:** Well, I could help you prepare something.  I have a late 
             date with Eric... [_Niles turns round angrily:_] -a.  
             An elderly Aunt Erica, but I could come over early and have 
             everything ready by the time Mrs. Crane arrives. 
      **Niles:** Well, thank you, Daphne.
     **Daphne:** Now, what do you think Mrs. Crane would like for dinner?
      **Niles:** Oh, you have free reign.  Just bear in mind she can't have
             shellfish... poultry, red meat, saturated fats, nitrates,
             wheat, starch, sulfites, MSG or dairy.  Did I say nuts?
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think that's implied!

    AND STORMY NIGHT**
    
    [_Black screen, then:_]
    
    **NO, REALLY**
    
    _Scene One - Maris's Mansion - Night
    The living room of Maris's gothic mansion.  There is a grand piano, 
    a fireplace, and a stairway to the upper floor.  A small table for 
    two is set in one corner, with an open bottle of wine.  Outside the 
    rain is pouring, with lighting and thunder.
    
    Niles, wearing a red smoking jacket, ushers in Daphne, wet and 
    shivering._
    
      **Niles:** Come in Daphne, and warm yourself by the fire.  How did you 
             get so wet?
     **Daphne:** One of your trees blew down in your driveway.  I had to walk
             the last hundred yards. [_Niles takes her coat._] I must say,
             you have a beautiful home. 
      **Niles:** Oh, well thank you.  Actually, it was in Maris's family for 
             four generations.  When I was an mere intern I used to drive
             through these hills, never dreaming that one day I'd live in
             one of these great mansions.  Then one afternoon, there was
             Maris, looking so helpless, banging on the gates with her
             little fists and a tire iron. 
     **Daphne:**[_now by the fire:_] They'd locked her in?
      **Niles:** No, no, that was much later.  No, this time she was returning 
             from the antique mart with a rare bell jar once owned by 
             Sylvia Plath, when the gates failed to open.  So naturally 
             I stopped to offer my assistance, and as our hands touched 
             there was a sudden spark of electricity, then as if by magic 
             the gates parted before us, and we took it as a sign.
     **Daphne:** You knew you were meant to be together.
      **Niles:** Yes.  We were married just three short years later. 
     
    _Daphne sits on the couch and notices an antique musical clock._
    
     **Daphne:** Look at this, it's beautiful!
      **Niles:** It's a Glockenspiel.  We bought it on our honeymoon in Z�rich.
             [_sits next to her_] I brought it down from the attic to remind 
             Maris of better times.  It used to play beautiful music, and 
             now it doesn't.  How's that for irony? [_rises_] Well, let's 
             get you into some dry clothes, so you can get started on 
             dinner, and we can get you home in time for your date! 
    
    _He goes to the staircase.  Daphne begins to cry._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne? [_comes back_] What is it?
     **Daphne:** Nothing.
      **Niles:** No, no, it's definitely something.  I'm a psychiatrist, I can
             read the signs.
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't want to spoil your reunion with Mrs.
             Crane, but... Eric broke up with me.
      **Niles:**[_sits down to comfort her_] He did?
     **Daphne:** Yes.  He said he couldn't commit to me and his music.  He had
             to stay focused.  I knew it was an excuse - I've heard his
             music!  He must have another girl. 
    
    _She breaks down sobbing and buries her head in his chest.  He puts 
    his arm around her._
    
      **Niles:** Well, he's a fool, Daphne, and if he can't appreciate you 
             then you're better off without him. 
     **Daphne:** Right now, I'm not so sure, but thank you, Dr. Crane. 
    
    _She's never been this close to him before.  He can't help reaching 
    out to stroke her hair.  The phone at his elbow rings, and he puts a 
    finger to his lips to silence it, but then thinks again and picks up._
    
      **Niles:**[_answering:_] Niles Crane.  Oh, Maris! 
    
    _He jumps up, causing Daphne to tip over and bump her head._
    
      **Niles:** Where are you?  What do you mean you can't come home?  Well, 
             it's not that bad a storm!
    
    _Thunder and lightning strike at once to contradict him.  In front of 
    him, Daphne bends over before the fire and brushes out her hair._
    
      **Niles:**[_overcome_] Oh Maris, I really think you should come home.  
             No, no, well of course I don't want you traveling if it's not 
             safe.  Yes, yes, I understand.  I'll see you tomorrow. [_puts 
             phone down_] Well, it seems like it's just the two of us. 
     **Daphne:** You mean Mrs. Crane won't be coming? 
    
    _Lightning strikes again.  The lights go out._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh my, there goes the electricity.  What do we do now? 
    
    _Niles puts a finger to his lips very seriously, as if he's thinking 
    about his lifelong dream.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    Later, Martin is on the phone to Daphne.  Frasier is reading on the sofa._
    
     **Martin:** No, no, the storm's really bad.  You shouldn't be driving in
             it anyway.  No, you just spend the night there.  Right, 
             goodnight, Daphne. [_puts phone down_]
    **Frasier:** You told her to spend the night?
     **Martin:** Yeah, what's the problem?
    **Frasier:** Well, you know how Niles feels about her.
     **Martin:** Oh, relax.  It's just one of Niles's little crushes. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I suppose you're right.  Niles is harmless enough. 
             Besides, he'd never try anything with Maris in the house.
     **Martin:** Oh, Maris never made it back.  She's stuck in Arizona.
    **Frasier:** I've gotta get Daphne out of there! 
    
    _He jumps to his feet and grabs his coat._
    
     **Martin:** Why?!
    **Frasier:** Why?  My God, it's a recipe for disaster!  You've got a 
             vulnerable woman and an unstable man in a gothic mansion on 
             a rainy night!  The only thing missing is someone shouting 
             "Heathcliff!" across the moors!
     **Martin:**[_grabs his coat_] Wait for me!
    **Frasier:** Oh, Dad, Dad, you're not coming!
     **Martin:** Yes, I am!
    **Frasier:** No, you're not!
     **Martin:** I am!
    
    _Martin and Frasier leave the apartment, still arguing.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three - Maris's Mansion.
    Meanwhile, the gothic atmosphere continues as Niles plays heavily on 
    the piano.  As if to complete it, Daphne comes downstairs wearing a 
    frilly white silk peignoir with matching capelet, carrying a lit 
    candelabra._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh, Dr. Crane, you play beautifully!
      **Niles:** Thank you. 
    
    _He turns to look at her and goes completely off key.  Then he 
    recovers and plays a "de-de" finale to cover it up._
    
     **Daphne:** I found this in the upstairs guest room, I hope it's alright.
      **Niles:** I-I thought you were going to put on some of Maris's clothes.
             You know, something bulky from her wool collection.
     **Daphne:** Well yeah, I was, but she's quite a bit smaller than me.  
             [_lifts the capelet, showing her bare shoulder_] This is all 
             I could find that fit.  Should I go look for something else?
      **Niles:** No - yes - no... [_sits down on the piano keys, then stands 
             back up_] oh, you know er... No, the important thing is that 
             it's big enough, [_strokes his hands down her arms_] and warm 
             enough, [_strokes it again_] and sssssilky enough, [_strokes it 
             a third time_] and... [_starts to stroke it again and stops_] 
             I have to make a phone call. 
    
    _He runs up the stairs.  As Daphne bends over the rail to watch him 
    go, he makes sure to stop and lean over to steal a glance at her 
    backside.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment. 
    At Frasier's apartment, the phone is ringing, and the machine answers._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on machine:_] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  I'm 
             listening. [_beep_]
      **Niles:**[_on machine:_] Frasier?  Frasier!  I'm having a little crisis 
             here.  Actually a large crisis.  It's no time to screen calls... 
             Damn! [_hangs up_]
    
    _As he speaks, Eddie perches on a chair, staring at the machine.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Five - Frasier's BMW.
    Meanwhile, Frasier and Martin are driving to the mansion of the damned._
    
     **Martin:** This is stupid.
    **Frasier:** It is not.
     **Martin:** Look, nothing's going to happen between them anyway.
    **Frasier:** What if it does?  He's my brother and he loves his wife!  
             Now, now, I know, I know their marriage is not exactly 
             everyone's cup of tea.  But on some twisted, bizarre level 
             it seems to work for them.  If Niles ever did anything to 
             hurt to his marriage, he's the one who'd suffer.  He's my 
             brother and I won't let him suffer!
     **Martin:** Hey, slow down!  You're going to miss the turn onto 
             Roosevelt. 
    **Frasier:** Dad, I let you come along strictly on the agreement that you
             would not give directions.
     **Martin:** I'm not giving directions, I'm just telling you which way's
             faster.
    **Frasier:** Roosevelt'll add ten minutes.
     **Martin:** In sunshine.  In rain it's faster!
    **Frasier:** Oh what, spatial relationships change when it rains?!
     **Martin:** No, you've just got better traction on Roosevelt.  Of course, 
             you wouldn't have to worry about that if you'd gotten all-
             weather tires like I told you to, but no, you had to have 
             the fancy German thing...
    
    _Martin and Frasier carry on arguing.
    
    CUT TO:
    
    Scene Six - Maris's Mansion.
    Lighning strikes, and things are heating up.  Daphne is sitting on 
    the couch, staring at the fire.  Niles brings in some firewood._
    
      **Niles:** We'd better make this last, this is all that's left of the 
             wood. [_Daphne begins to cry._] Oh no, don't worry, if 
             this runs out there's an antique sideboard in the drawing 
             room that I think is reproduction. [_she looks at him_] Oh. 
             It's Eric, isn't it?
    
    _She nods, then stands and walks closer to the fire._
    
     **Daphne:** I don't know why I'm being so silly.  We weren't together 
             long enough for anything to really happen. 
      **Niles:**[_comes up behind her_] Sometimes the strongest feelings come 
             from the promise of what might happen.  Just the anticipation 
             is enough to make all the little hairs on your neck stand on 
             end. 
    
    _He smooths down the hackles on the back of his neck.  Suddenly she 
    turns to face him._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane...
      **Niles:**[_passionately:_] Yes, Daphne? 
     **Daphne:** We're losing the fire.
      **Niles:** No we're not, it's burning with the heat of a thousand suns!
     **Daphne:**[_turning to the fire:_] But it's down to its last embers!
      **Niles:**[_calming down:_] Well then... I'll put some wood on it!
    
    _CUT TO:
    
    Scene Seven - Frasier's BMW.
    The car has stalled outside of Maris's mansion._
    
     **Martin:** You flooded it.  You had to keep pumping gas and now you 
             flooded it.
    **Frasier:** Dad, you cannot flood a fuel-injected engine.  Oh, this so
             maddening.  We're so close to the house, I can see the 
             gargoyles! 
     **Martin:** If we'd have taken Roosevelt...
    **Frasier:** We'd be stuck on Roosevelt!
     **Martin:** You never can admit it when you made a mistake, could you?
    **Frasier:**[_unbuckles seatbelt_] Oh that is it, just call the auto club, 
             I'm gonna make a dash for it. 
    
    _He gets out of the car and runs._
    
     **Martin:**[_shouting:_] You'll make better time if you take the shortcut 
             by the side of the fountain! [_off Frasier's response:_] Well, 
             same to you!
    
    _CUT TO: 
    
    Scene Eight - Maris's Mansion.
    Daphne and Niles are now lying down in front of the fire.  Daphne is 
    on her back, Niles on his side, head propped on one elbow, looking 
    down at her._
    
     **Daphne:** I suppose I just fall in love too fast.  The minute I feel
             that spark, I just give my heart away. 
      **Niles:** Daphne, you must stop being so hard on yourself.  What you 
             see as a fault is also your greatest gift - to be so open, 
             warm and loving. 
     **Daphne:** You're so kind, Dr. Crane.  I'm glad we ended up like this
             tonight.
      **Niles:** So am I. 
     **Daphne:** It's just so nice to be with a man you feel so comfortable
             with.  I feel very close to you.
      **Niles:** I feel very close to you too, Daphne.  You know it's easy 
             being someone you feel close to, when you feel close to 
             someone... who's so close.
    
    _Daphne rests her head back and closes her eyes.  If Niles moves now,
    she could be his.  He leans over to kiss her...
    
    Suddenly beautiful music is heard.  Daphne opens her eyes and sees 
    the Glockenspiel whirring away._
    
     **Daphne:** Dr. Crane, your Glockenspiel has sprung to life!
      **Niles:**[_confused, then looks up:_] Oh, the clock!  
     
    _He gets up and sits on the couch to admire it.  In front of him, 
    Daphne rises to her knees to do the same._
    
      **Niles:** My God, it hasn't run like this in years!  Maris will be 
             delighted... Maris.
     **Daphne:** You really love her, don't you?
      **Niles:** You know, I do.  Love is a funny thing, isn't it?  Sometimes 
             it's exciting and passionate.  Sometimes it's something else.
             Something... comfortable and familiar.  That newly-exfoliated
             little face staring up at you across the breakfast table...
             sharing a laugh together when you see someone wearing white
             after Labor Day.
     **Daphne:** I hope some day some man will feel that way about me. 
      **Niles:**[_staring into her eyes:_] Oh... Daphne, don't worry.  You are
             a very special person, and some day a man worthy of you will
             come along... just as soon as the gods create him. 
     **Daphne:**[_laughs_] That's the loveliest thing anyone's ever said to me. 
             Thank you, Dr. Crane.  You're a good friend. 
    
    _Unaware that Frasier has just vaulted onto the terrace outside, 
    Daphne leans forward and kisses Niles on the cheek.  Just as
    she does, lightning flashes and thunder booms._
    
    **Frasier:**_STOOOOOO-OOOP!  STOOOOOP!_
    
    _They turn in shock to see Frasier, soaking wet, pounding on the 
    glass doors with both fists and screaming, looking rather like 
    Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate", or with the lightning crashing 
    behind him, a character in an old horror film._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    
    _Niles opens a side door and Frasier rushes in._
    
    **Frasier:** My God, have you two gone mad?!  You'll regret this for the
             rest of your lives!
      **Niles:** What are you talking about?
    **Frasier:** Well, the two of you here alone, the fire, the candlelight,
             the nightie!
     **Daphne:**[_laughing:_] Dr. Crane, you didn't think that Dr. Crane and I
             were... [_shocked:_] Dr. Crane!  You have some nerve to imply 
             that your brother would do anything so deplorable!  Why, 
             just moments ago he made a beautiful speech about how much 
             he loves his wife, how he cherishes her excruciating little 
             face, and how they laugh at white people! 
    
    _Frasier looks confused._
    
     **Daphne:**[_to Niles:_] That didn't sound right.
      **Niles:** Close enough.
    **Frasier:** I'm sorry, Daphne, I didn't mean to suggest that, I didn't 
             try to imply that...
     **Daphne:** Well then, exactly what was it you wanted us to stop doing?
    **Frasier:** I... wanted you to stop standing here in silence.  A night 
             like this calls for music!  Daphne, please, some wine for 
             all of us.  Niles, join me at the piano, please.
    
    _Daphne goes and pours some wine.  Frasier grabs Niles by the arm and 
    pulls him down onto the piano bench with him._
    
    **Frasier:** Are you sure everything's alright?
      **Niles:** Absolutely.  Frasier, my Glockenspiel is working again!
    
    _Frasier browses through his "Gray's Anatomy" for a moment, then:_
    
    **Frasier:** Shall we?
    
    _They begin to play._
    
    _End of Act Two (Time: 22:15)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Niles and Frasier are playing the piano, Daphne stands behind them,
    all three of them are singing.  It is still raining, and Martin comes 
    round the corner knocking on the windows.  However, their boisterous 
    singing drowns him out, and he is left out in the stormy weather, 
    pounding on the window with his cane.
