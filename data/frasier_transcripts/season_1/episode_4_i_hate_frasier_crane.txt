    _Act One._
    
    **I HATE FRASIER CRANE**
    
    _Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
    It's the early evening.  Frasier is playing a tune on the piano, 
    Martin is looking through some old police work, and Daphne is 
    busying herself in the kitchen.  Frasier turns round to find Eddie 
    staring at him._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, he's doing it again!  Must this dog stare at me all the time?
     **Martin:** I don't know.  Eddie - must ya? [_Eddie carries on staring_] 
             Apparently he must.
    **Frasier:**[_to Eddie:_] What is so fascinating about me?  What is it? 
             Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble?  Am I some 
             sort of canine enigma?  Think about it, get back to me.
    
    _Daphne enters carrying a tray of food._
    
     **Daphne:** Here we are, gents, dinner's up. [_to Martin:_] Can I give you 
             a hand clearing up your papers?
     **Martin:** No, you better let me.  I need to keep these in a particular 
             order.
     **Daphne:** What is all this, anyway?
     **Martin:** Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the 
             "Weeping Lotus" murder. 
    **Frasier:** Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. 
             He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years.
     **Martin:** Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it.  You adopt 
             certain instincts when you're a cop.  And my instinct tells 
             me that this case can be cracked.  There just must be one 
             small thing I keep overlooking. [_tidies papers_]
    **Frasier:** There is - who the murderer was. [_laughs_]
    
    _The doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and 
    Martin chat._
    
     **Daphne:** It's nice you feel so dedicated.
     **Martin:** It's a hobby.  Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try 
             to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to 
             stuff her entire body into a bowling bag.  It's relaxing!
    
    _At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a 
    bottle of wine.  He enters and hands the wine to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.
      **Niles:** Sorry I'm late, Frasier.  Just as we were leaving, Maris had a 
             run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it 
             shattered her calm.
    **Frasier:** Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high 
             strung?  Maybe she should see someone.
      **Niles:** She's seen everyone, why do you think she was calling 
             directory assistance?
     **Daphne:** Evening, Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.  It's so good to see you again. [_she puts the 
             meal down_] What an enchanting scent you're wearing.
     **Daphne:**[_smells herself_] Must be the ranch dressing.  Won't Mrs. 
             Crane be coming?
      **Niles:** No, I'm afraid.  And please, no more of this "Doctor" and "Mrs. 
             Crane" formality.  To you, it's Niles and... [_stumped_] er...
    **Frasier:** Maris.
      **Niles:** Yes, Maris.
     **Martin:** Glad you could join us, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.
     **Martin:** Well, I guess the food's all ready: why don't we just go 
             ahead and start?
    
    _Everyone sits down except Daphne who begins to take her food into 
    the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, enjoy.
     **Martin:** Where are you going?
     **Daphne:** I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen.
     **Martin:** Don't be ridiculous.
      **Niles:** Yes, we can't have you eating by yourself in the kitchen. 
             I'll join you.
     **Martin:** No.  We're all eating right here, like a family, end of 
             discussion.
     **Daphne:** Well, isn't this nice?  Feels just like home.
      **Niles:** I'm famished.
    **Frasier:** Me, too.
    
    _Niles and Frasier begin to eat..._
    
     **Martin:** You boys still say a prayer before you eat?
    
    _They relent and pretend they do.  All four close their eyes and hold 
    their hands together.  As Martin begins his prayer, Niles stares at 
    Daphne as Eddie stares at Frasier.  Daphne does not notice with her 
    eyes shut.  However, Frasier notices Eddie's skin-creeping look._
    
     **Martin:** We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat.  You have 
             blessed our table with your palm.  And thank you, Lord, for 
             bringing this family together and we also thank you for the 
             other gifts you have given to us.  And may we always be able 
             to share with those less fortunate...
    **Frasier:**[_to Eddie:_] OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING!
      **Niles:**[_off guard:_] I wasn't staring!
     **Martin:**[_takes what he can get_] Amen.
    
    _They all settle down.  Daphne looks at Niles a little suspiciously 
    as he begins the meal conversation._
      **Niles:** So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column 
             today?  You were mentioned.
    **Frasier:** No, I missed it.
      **Niles:** Just as well, it wasn't flattering. 
    **Frasier:** I still would have liked to have seen it anyway.
      **Niles:** Oh, why didn't you say so? [_takes it out of his pocket_]
     **Daphne:** If I may ask, who's Derek Mann?
     **Martin:** He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the _Times_.  The 
             things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny 
             - what did he say about you?
    **Frasier:**[_reading:_] "I hate Frasier Crane."
     **Martin:**[_laughs, then:_] Oh, sorry. 
    **Frasier:** That's it.  "I hate Frasier Crane."  That's it?
     **Martin:** Oh, don't let it bother you.
    **Frasier:** Well, actually it doesn't, dad.  I knew when I chose a career 
             in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, 
             it's the price I pay for my celebrity.  Thank you, Niles, for 
             bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in 
             yellow!  Now, who would like some wine?
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'll have some.
    
    _Frasier goes to pour some as Niles compliments Daphne._
    
      **Niles:** Daphne, this salad is exquisite.
    **Frasier:**[_sitting down:_] Now why would he say that?
     **Martin:** Must be the carrots, he always did like them.
    **Frasier:** Not the salad, Derek Mann.  I mean, why would he write a thing 
             like that?  I've never done anything to him, the attack is 
             totally unwarranted.  I'm a healer, for God's sake.
     **Martin:** Oh, for crying out loud!
    **Frasier:** Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will 
             not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the 
             trash.
    
    _Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save.
     **Martin:** On what?
      **Niles:** Nothing.
     **Martin:** Come on, I'm interested.
      **Niles:** Oh, let's drop it.
     **Martin:** Why can't you tell me?
      **Niles:** All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret for 
             growing prize-winning zinnias.  Are you happy?
     **Martin:**[_beat_] Not really.
    _FADE OUT_
    
    **OH, YEAH...**
    
    _Scene Two - Radio Station.
    The following afternoon Frasier is taking a call on air in his booth 
    as Roz listens._
    
     **Frasier:** All right, Lorraine.  Now, calm down and try and listen to 
              what I'm going to say to you.  Will you do that?
    **Lorraine:**[_v.o:_] Okay.
     **Frasier:** All right, good girl.  Now your problem...
    **Lorraine:**[_beep_] Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is 
              trying to get through.  Do you mind if I take it?
     **Frasier:** No, no.  Go right ahead. [_she does_] Well, certainly a very 
              interesting situation she's got herself into.  Don't you 
              think so, Roz?
    
    _Roz is busy eating and reading magazines.  She has to quickly chew her 
    food, put down her books just for the simple:_
    
         **Roz:** Yes. 
    **Lorraine:** Okay, I'm back.
     **Frasier:** All right, Lorraine.  Now listen very carefully to what I'm 
              going to tell you.  Your problem seems...
    **Lorraine:**[_beep_] Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back.
     **Frasier:** For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is 
              popular. [_laughs_]
    **Lorraine:** Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane.  I'm here. [_beep_] Oh, I don't 
              believe it - another call.
     **Frasier:** Hold it there, Lorraine.  The reason why you want to take 
              that other call is the same reason that you want to change 
              your career and break up with your boyfriend.  You're 
              obsessed with what you think you're missing.  The better 
              offer, the call on the other line.  Well, you've got to take 
              one call at a time from now on.  Fully explore and 
              experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger 
              person for it.  Do you follow me, Lorraine?
    **Lorraine:** Okay, I'm back! 
     **Frasier:** Thank you for your call. [_hangs up_] Well, we've only got 
              two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on 
              a personal note.  As some of you may know, yesterday I was 
              mentioned in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column.  He 
              said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... "I Hate Frasier 
              Crane". [_sarcastic:_] What trenchant criticism.  Move aside 
              Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a 
              new kid in town.  One can only wonder how many hours Derek 
              Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his 
              trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef 
              t'ouerve: "I Hate Frasier Crane."  A lesser critic would 
              have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, 
              point by point, constructive critique of this show.  No, not 
              our Mr. Mann.  So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column 
              arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but 
              above all, treasure it.  For one day this man will be joining 
              the Pantheon of the immortals.  And if we're lucky... it'll be 
              one day soon.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. [_signs off_]
    
    _Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around 
    before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then "holsters" it
    in his belt.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **YEAH!**
    
    _Scene Three - Caf e Nervosa.
    The following afternoon Frasier is drinking a coffee in the cafe with 
    Roz when Niles enters and sits with him._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, how funny running into you here.
    **Frasier:** I'm always here.
      **Niles:** Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago: have you seen 
             today's "Times"?
    **Frasier:**[_knowing what's coming:_] No.
      **Niles:** Lucky for you I saved you this copy.  Take a look at Derek 
             Mann's column.
    **Frasier:** You know, this is the second time in as many days that you 
             have given me a paper.  Have you ever considered getting 
             yourself a route?
      **Niles:**[_to Roz:_] Hello, I don't believe we've met.
        **Roz:** Yes we have, Niles, three or four times.  Roz Doyle.
      **Niles:** Oh, of course.  It was at the... it was during the... well, I'm far 
             too successful to feel awkward.  Where did we meet?
        **Roz:** The radio station.
      **Niles:** Ah, I'll take your word for it.  Nice to see you again. [_then,  
             to Frasier:_] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.
    **Frasier:** So I see. [_reading:_] "Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane 
             got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism 
             of his radio show.  Well, he asked for it, so here goes."
        **Roz:**[_noticing:_] Oh my god, his entire column is about your show.
      **Niles:** Not very flattering either.  Towards the end he even attacks 
             your "dimwitted sidekick call screener."
        **Roz:**[_appalled:_] That's me!
      **Niles:** Oh, now I remember you!
    **Frasier:**[_reading:_] "It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's 
             show -- his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self-
             congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice: a mock- 
             sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man 
             graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling 
             cult."
      **Niles:** It's continued on twelve.
    **Frasier:** I've read enough!
     **Waiter:**[_asking:_] Can I get you something?
    **Frasier:**[_to Niles:_] How can the man think something like that?
     **Waiter:** It's my job, I'm a waiter.
    **Frasier:** We don't want anything, thank you.
        **Roz:** Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll 
             blow over.
    **Frasier:** Oh, perhaps you're right.  As angry as it makes me, to 
             retaliate would be to stoop to his level.  So the best 
             response is no response at all.
    _FADE TO: 
    
    Scene Four - Radio Station.
    Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone 
    about the recent newspaper report._
    
    **Frasier:**[_angry:_] "Pompous and sanctimonious," am I?!  Well, this Mann 
             character can't even write grammatical sentences!  Every 
             five words there's one of his precious "dot, dot, dots." 
             Must be because he likes writing all those dots with the 
             crayon he writes this drivel in!
    
    _Roz, who looks like she has been listening to him rant for quite 
    a while, tries to steer him back to the show._
    
        **Roz:** Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a 
             problem with delayed gratification.
    **Frasier:** Well, he's just going to have to wait!  I don't know who this 
             Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind 
             his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering 
             behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for 
             what he is: not a man at all, but half a man! [_to Roz:_] Now 
             what line did you say Stewart was on?
        **Roz:** He hung up.
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. 
             Let's see who's on line five. [_he presses button:_] Hello, 
             this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening.
      **Derek:**[_v.o:_] Good, because I was listening too.
    **Frasier:** And you are?
      **Derek:** Derek Mann.
    **Frasier:**[_regretting:_] I see.
      **Derek:** Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League 
             twit.  So what do you say we settle this like men?
    **Frasier:** Are you implying that you want to fight me?
      **Derek:** I'm not implying, I'm saying.
    **Frasier:** Fight, as in a fist fight?
      **Derek:**[_sarcastic:_] No, I thought we might throw pies at each 
             other!  So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?
    **Frasier:**[_thinks_] We'll be right back after these messages.
    
    _Frasier signs off for commercials as we fade out.
    
    End Of Act One. (Time: 11:05)
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene One - Radio Station.
    The scene resumes where we left off.  The commercials have finished 
    and Frasier gets back to his radio show._
    
    **Frasier:** And we're back.  Well, we have a surprise caller on the line: 
             Derek Mann. 
      **Derek:**[_v.o:_] So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to 
             fight me or not?
    **Frasier:** Oh, you can't be serious.
      **Derek:** Just like I figured, you're chicken.
    **Frasier:** No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that 
             way.  You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion 
             about that subject?  Who do we have on the line?
        **Roz:** Well, lines one through eight are people who think you're chicken.
      **Derek:** You're chicken, Crane.  Admit it!
    **Frasier:** I am not chicken!
      **Derek:**[_squawks like a chicken_]
    **Frasier:** We are mature thinking people, not cavemen!
      **Derek:**[_squawks some more_]
    **Frasier:** Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! 
             You just say the time and place! 
      **Derek:** Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old 
             statue.  Noon tomorrow.  Don't back out!
    **Frasier:** I won't!  Don't you back out either because I know where your 
             office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you 
             down!  Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!
    _FADE TO:_
    **ET TU, EDDIE?**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment.
    That evening Martin is searching through his old case as Daphne 
    passes him._
    
     **Daphne:** Having a look at that old murder case again?
     **Martin:** Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos.
     **Daphne:** Well, don't be a greedy guts - let me have a look.
    
    _Daphne has a look at the photo of the girl.  After a while her psychic
    powers kick in._
    
     **Daphne:** Her name was Helen.
     **Martin:** Yeah, it was. [_knowing her trick:_] Ah, you must have seen it 
             on some of my papers I've had lying around here.
     **Daphne:** No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.
     **Martin:** You're putting me on.
     **Daphne:** She had a lot of men in her life.
     **Martin:** No kidding: she was a hooker!
     **Daphne:** No, I mean she had four brothers.
     **Martin:**[_surprised:_] That's amazing.  She did have four brothers. 
             What else are you getting?  Well, come on, tell me more.
     **Daphne:** I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet.
     **Martin:** Give it a try, will you?  Please.  What else are you getting?
     **Daphne:** Nothing. [_suddenly:_] No, wait.  I see a man.
     **Martin:** Yeah?
     **Daphne:** A well-dressed man.  He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat.
     **Martin:** Yeah?  Yeah?
     **Daphne:** He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long 
             hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the 
             door...
    
    _At this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing 
    tips and a trench coat - it's Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, everyone.
     **Daphne:** Sometimes I get my signals crossed.
    **Frasier:** What's going on?
     **Martin:** Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve - 
             nothing much!
     **Daphne:** We heard your show today.  I just loved the way you handled 
             that Derek Mann.
     **Martin:** You made your old man proud.  Yet the best part was when he 
             challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him. 
    **Frasier:**[_worried:_] Yes I did, didn't I?
     **Martin:** I can't wait to see that.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad.
     **Martin:** What are you talking about?
    **Frasier:** Well, I already won our little war of words.  What would I 
             stand to benefit by going through with actually going 
             through with a fist fight?
     **Martin:** Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged 
             you and you're backing down?
    **Frasier:** Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to 
             settle their differences.
     **Martin:** A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the 
             way I brought you up.
    **Frasier:** Are you encouraging me to fight?
     **Martin:** You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even 
             had lunch yet.
     **Martin:** I might have known this would have happened.  It's Billy Kreizel 
             all over again.
    **Frasier:** What did you say?
     **Martin:** Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.
    **Frasier:** I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty 
             years ago.
     **Daphne:** Who's this Billy Kreizel?
    **Frasier:** Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me!
     **Martin:** So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.
    **Frasier:** Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my 
             blazer!
     **Martin:** Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight 
             after school.  Only "Patches" here didn't show up!
    **Frasier:** I had a clarinet lesson!
     **Martin:** You don't need to remind me of that!  Billy's old man was a 
             cop, too.  Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for 
             years.  Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they 
             used to say, "What's the matter?  You got a clarinet lesson?"
     **Daphne:**[_wondering:_] Couldn't you and Billy have met after the 
             clarinet lesson?
    **Frasier:** Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment!
     **Daphne:**[_gets up:_] I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a 
             lot in this house. 
    
    _She exits to the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not 
             fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago.  But the situation 
             is not the same now.
     **Martin:** It's exactly the same.
    **Frasier:** I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a 
             certain position in this city - I do not settle my 
             differences with brawling.
     **Martin:** The man challenged you and you accepted. 
    **Frasier:** Dad, I can't believe this.  You won't be happy until I come 
             home with a black eye.
     **Martin:** I just want you to do what you said you were going to do. 
             You know, you can talk about your medical school, your 
             intellect, your place in this city, but you know what?  It's 
             all one big clarinet lesson... I can't even look at you.
    
    _Martin exits to the kitchen, angry with his son.  Frasier is left with 
    little dignity and looks at Eddie for a little support.  However, even 
    Eddie turns his face away from him.  Frasier can only sulk._
    
    [_N.B. Billy Kreizel is the name of a boy who bullied director David Lee
    in the sixth grade._]
    _FADE TO:_
    **REQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT**
    
    _Scene Three - Caf e Nervosa.
    The next day, Frasier is preparing for the big fight whilst chatting 
    with Roz._
    
        **Roz:** So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I 
             notice the garbage man looking right in at me.  So I say, 
             "Did you get a good look?"  And he says, "Not completely, 
             turn around."  Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, 
             and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.
    **Frasier:** Roz, why are you telling me this story?
        **Roz:** I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five 
             minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and 
             get your clock cleaned.
    **Frasier:** Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win 
             this fight?
        **Roz:** Your shoe's untied. [_Frasier checks his tied shoes_] If you 
             fell for that one, you're going down and you're going down 
             hard.
      **Niles:**[_enters_] Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. 
             Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with 
             balloons...
    **Frasier:** All that's missing is a mariachi band.
      **Niles:** They're setting up.
        **Roz:** Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd.  I'll be 
             off to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and 
             want to throw it to a beautiful _senorita._
    
    _She leaves the Caf e.  Niles looks at Frasier._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you 
             doing this?
    **Frasier:** It's Billy Kreizel.
      **Niles:**[_looking around:_] Where?
    **Frasier:**[_shakes head_] He's not here, Niles.  It's just that I ran away 
             from him when I was ten. 
      **Niles:** I remember.
    **Frasier:** You know, I've been running ever since.  You know, this is 
             where it stops.  I'm not running anymore.
      **Niles:** What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?
    
    _As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket 
    and buffs his nails.  He blows on them and offers the file to 
    Frasier which he refuses._
    
    **Frasier:**[_sarcastic:_] Chalk it up to random violence!
    
    _Niles nods in agreement and exits the caf e.  Martin enters._
    
     **Martin:** Hey, there.
    **Frasier:** Dad?  What are you doing here?
     **Martin:** Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe 
             went over the line.
    **Frasier:** Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into 
             something that I wasn't ready to do -- well, you're wrong.  
             You can relax.  I took this on for myself.
     **Martin:** Good.
    **Frasier:** Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway?
     **Martin:** Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son. 
    
    _They smile.  Daphne enters._
    
     **Daphne:** Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter.  We're getting 
             a freebie.  Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. 
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Daphne.  Any psychic predictions on the outcome?
     **Daphne:** Actually, yes.  But don't worry, I'm frequently wrong.
    
    _Frasier removes his jacket and tie.  Niles comes in._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. 
             [_points out of window:_] There, the man standing to the left 
             of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, 
             that's Derek Mann.
    **Frasier:** He's gigantic!
     **Daphne:**[_looking out:_] My God, you could show a movie on his back!
     **Martin:** Are you sure you want to go through with this?
    **Frasier:** Yes, yes I am.
    
    _Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up._
    
     **Martin:** Good, you'll be fine.  Just remember this is a street fight 
             and not a boxing match.  So fight dirty and throw the first 
             punch!
     **Daphne:** I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the 
             trick. [_cocky:_] If you have any doubts, check with a fellow 
             in Manchester named Nigel Tavers.
      **Niles:**[_begins to leave:_] Well, if we want an unobstructed view...
    **Frasier:**[_stops him:_] Look, I prefer if you guys stay here.  You'll 
             only make me nervous.
     **Martin:** Whatever you want.
    
    _They all wish Frasier good luck.  As he exits the mariachi band 
    strikes up.  They all move over to the window to look out._
    
     **Martin:** They've got a mariachi band out there!
      **Niles:** I'll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer 
             barbeque.
     **Daphne:** Oh look, they're starting the fight.
     **Martin:** Nah, they're just circling, sizing each other up.  Come on,
             Frasier, if you're going to hit him, hit him now!
    
    _They all shout encouragements, then police sirens are heard._
    
      **Niles:** Is that the police?
     **Martin:** Yeah, what are they doing here?
     **Daphne:** They're breaking it up!  Just when they were getting started.
    
    _Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. 
    The officer marches Frasier right into the Caf e._
    
    **Frasier:** Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my 
             jacket.
    **Officer:** Relax, I'm not arresting you.  But I'm warning you that in 
             this town we don't settle our differences with street fights 
             - no matter who you are. 
    **Frasier:** Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.
    **Officer:** Okay. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, dad, did you see me?  My hands are trembling, my chest 
             is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... 
             God, I feel great! 
     **Martin:** You did good.
    **Frasier:** Yeah, I was out there.  I was raring to go, you saw that...
     **Martin:** I know you were.  You would have kicked his butt!
     **Daphne:** From here to Tacoma.
      **Niles:**[_shouting:_] I think we should celebrate!  Everyone, a round 
             of victory lattes on me. 
    
    _As the gang celebrate, Martin walks up to the officer on the door._
    
     **Martin:** Thanks Harry, I owe you one.
    **Officer:** No problem, Marty.
     **Martin:** You cut it pretty close, though.  Another minute, then Frasier 
             would have been sidewalk litter.  He would have been lunch 
             meat. 
    **Officer:** Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke's. 
             Why don't you come along?
     **Martin:** Yeah, maybe I will.  And you know why I will?  Because the 
             Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore.
    **Officer:** What the hell are you talking about?
     **Martin:**[_embarrassed:_] Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct.
