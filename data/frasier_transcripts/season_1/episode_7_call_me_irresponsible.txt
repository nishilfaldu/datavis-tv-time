    _Act One._
    
    _Scene One: The Frasier Crane Show.  
    Frasier is at his console._
    
    **Frasier:**[_into mike_] It's 4:25 and this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  Roz, who's
             our next caller?
        **Roz:** We have Hank on line three.  He's having trouble with his 
             neighbors.
    **Frasier:** Hello Hank.  I'm listening.
       **Hank:** Am I on?
    **Frasier:** Yes, you are on the air.
       **Hank:** Hello, am I on?
    **Frasier:** Hank, listen.  Turn down your radio and just talk into your
             phone. 
       **Hank:** Hello?
    **Frasier:** Listen, Hank please, you won't be able to hear yourself, we're
             on a seven-second delay.
       **Hank:** Hello, can you hear me?
    **Frasier:** Oh, for crying out loud. [_hangs up on Hank_] Thank you, Hank.
             People, would you please turn off your damn radios. [_Roz
             immediately starts making very large "NO" gestures_] No, I mean
             just those of you who are calling in!  Roz, who's our next caller?
        **Roz:** We have Marco on line two.  He's having problems with his
             relationship.
    **Frasier:** Hello Marco.  I'm listening.
      **Marco:** Well, I uh, I started seeing this woman two years ago.  I think
             it was two years.  Um, it was around Thanksgiving.  Yeah, yeah,
             yeah, right.  The leaves were off the trees and the...
    **Frasier:** Close enough.  What is your problem, Marco?
      **Marco:** Well, it's not really my problem, it's more like her problem.
             Lately she keeps pressing me for a commitment.
    **Frasier:** What's holding you back?
      **Marco:** I don't know, I just... I guess I just want to keep my options
             open.  You know, in case somebody better comes along.
    **Frasier:** "Somebody better comes along."  Somebody better comes along?!
             Marco, Marco, Marco, do you hear yourself?
      **Marco:** No, I turned my radio off after you blasted that other guy.
    **Frasier:** Well listen, I suggest you give your motives a thorough examination,
             and if you can't commit, it's best for both of you to break
             it off.  Thank you for your call. [_hangs up_] Tell me listeners,
             what is it with guys like that?  Hey Roz, you've been around
             the block a few times.  You ever run into a guy like Marco?
        **Roz:** Oh, they're all Marcos.  You can't swing a dead cat without
             hitting a Marco.
    **Frasier:** Come on.  I mean, if that were so, then no-one would be having
             a relationship.
        **Roz:** Well, I'm not.  My sister's not.  None of my friends are.  I've
             seen the future, and its name is Marco.
    **Frasier:** What do you think, Seattle?  Are there any non-Marcos out
             there?  Or is Roz here destined to live a life of hopeless,
             loveless spinsterhood?  Back after this.
    
    _He goes off the air._
    
        **Roz:** Gee, I just love it when you include me in your show.
    _FADE OUT_
    **'TWAS TWO MONTHS
    BEFORE CHRISTMAS...**
    
    _Scene Two: Frasier's apartment. 
    The fireplace is decorated with all the Christmas trappings.  In front 
    of it is a tree to which Martin is hanging a final bauble._
    
     **Martin:** This is really weird.  It's not even Halloween yet.  Do we really
             have to do this now?
     **Daphne:**[_setting up a camera_] If we're going to have a picture for the
             Christmas card, we've got to make it look like Christmas.
     **Martin:** I don't know why we just can't do what my wife and I did - put
             Frasier and Niles in matching sweaters and sit them on the hood
             of the old Packard.
     **Daphne:** Well, this year we're going to be a little more artistic, right?
     **Martin:** Where the hell is Frasier anyway?  I could use some help here.
     **Daphne:** He's still napping.  My grandfather used to nap every afternoon.
             He lived to be ninety-three.
     **Martin:** Really?
     **Daphne:** He'd lie there on the sofa, and you couldn't wake him for the
             world.  Grammy would say "He might as well be a dead man."
             Then of course, one day, we couldn't wake him.  He really 
             was a dead man.  Poor Grammy.  For weeks she'd keep insisting, 
             "He's napping, he's napping".
     **Martin:** Okay.  I'm going to turn it on. [_plugs in fairy lights_]
     **Daphne:** Oh, it's lovely. 
    
    _She starts singing, Martin joins in._
    
       **Both:** "Deck the halls with boughs of holly;
             Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
             'Tis the season to be jolly;
             Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!" etc.
    
    _The carol continues as Frasier comes in, still groggy from his nap. 
    He looks around, at a loss._
    	 
    **Frasier:** Excuse me, excuse me. [_they stop singing_] Exactly how long
             have I been asleep?
     **Martin:** Oh good, you're up.  Now we can get this picture taken.
    **Frasier:** What picture?
     **Daphne:** The picture for the Christmas card.  We told you about it last
             week, remember?
    **Frasier:** Oh, oh right.
     **Daphne:**[_handing out woolen hats_] Now the theme this year is "Santa's
             Workshop."  Everybody put on your little elf hats.
    **Frasier:** I am not putting this on my head.  For God's sake, I mean, I'm
             a respected professional.
     **Martin:**[_wearing his_] But if you don't, it'll look stupid.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I think the ship has already sailed on that one.
     **Martin:** Just put the hat on, Frasier.
    **Frasier:** You can't tell me what to do.
     **Martin:** I am telling you, look, put the hat on.
    **Frasier:** No, look, the days are past when you can just sit me on top
             of some stupid old Packard and make me wear matching sweaters 
             with my little brother.
     **Daphne:** Boys, boys please.  Don't fight.  Are you forgetting what day
             it is?
    **Frasier:** It's October 21st!
     **Martin:** Can we just get the picture taken, please?
    
    _Daphne sets the camera timer and gets into the group huddle._
    
     **Daphne:** Alright, I've got it all set.  Fifteen seconds, gents. [_realises_]
             Oh, wait.  There's something missing.  Where's Eddie?
     **Martin:** Oh, he's in the bathroom, getting a drink.  EDDIE!
    
    _To the sound of sleigh bells, Eddie appears.  To Frasier's ire,
    he has reindeer antlers tied to his head.  The camera flashes._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I can always pray there's a postal strike.
    _FADE TO:_
    **M &M;'s AND SYMPATHY**
    
    _Scene Three: Radio Studio
    Frasier is finishing his show._
    
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Well, that's just about it for today.  This is Dr. 
             Frasier Crane, saying go on out there and make it a great 
             evening, Seattle.
    
    _He goes off the air.  Roz enters with one of his studio portraits 
    and a pen._]
    
        **Roz:** Hey, before you go, there's a fan in the hall who'd like your
             autograph.
    **Frasier:** Oh, God.  Save me from my adoring fans. 
    
    _He signs the photo then looks out of the window to see a beautiful woman 
    (Catherine) waving at him._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Ooh... ooh, but not from the adorable ones. 
    
    _He exits into the corridor._ 
    
      **Frasier:** Hello.  Ah, my producer told me you wanted an autograph.  Ah, how should 
               I make this out?
    **Catherine:** You disgust me!  You parasitic fraud!
      **Frasier:** Well, that's certainly different from the usual "Best Regards." 
               [_moves to escape_]
    **Catherine:** Wait a minute, don't walk away from me.  For once you're going
               to face the consequences of what happens after you hang up on
               your callers.
      **Frasier:** What consequences?  What are you talking about?
    **Catherine:** I'm Marco's girlfriend.  Excuse me - ex-girlfriend, thanks to
               you.
      **Frasier:** Marco?  You mean the Marco who-didn't-want-to-commit Marco? 
    
    _He goes into the booth and she follows him._
    
    **Catherine:** Ah, you damn radio shrinks!  You couldn't just tell him to
               stick with it.  That kind of advice doesn't get big ratings.
               No, "break up with her, get on with your life and ruin hers." 
               Now that's entertainment.
      **Frasier:** Now just hold on one minute.  Did you actually listen to the
               show?
    **Catherine:**...No.  But Marco told me what you said.
      **Frasier:** Oh he did, did he?  Did he also mention that he said that he
               was only staying with you to "keep his options open?"  Because 
               that's what he told me.  To be exact, he said he was only 
               staying with you "until somebody better came along."
    **Catherine:** He said that?
      **Frasier:** He said that to most of Seattle.  Apparently you're the only
               one who missed it.
    **Catherine:** So, it wasn't that he didn't want to commit.  He just didn't
               want to commit to me. [_starts to cry_]
      **Frasier:** Well I'm... I'm terribly sorry I had to tell you.  But, um, at
               least now you know the truth.  Oh, no-no-no, don't cry.  You're
               in a place of business here. 
    
    _With his usual tact, he places a folder over the mike to protect it 
    from her tears._
    
    **Catherine:** Ooh, boy, I can really pick 'em, can't I?
      **Frasier:** Oh no, don't go there.  Look, this is not your fault.  You are
               a terrifically attractive young woman - I mean, maybe a bit 
               overemotional...
    **Catherine:**[_buries her head in Frasier's shoulder_] OOHH!
      **Frasier:**[_hugging her_] Oh, yes.  There, there.  Shh... listen, can I... 
               can I get you something?
    **Catherine:** No.
      **Frasier:** A drink of water?
    **Catherine:** No.
      **Frasier:**[_lost, looks around and sees the candy machine_] M&M;'s?
    **Catherine:**[_they break_] Plain or peanut?
      **Frasier:** Whichever you like.
    **Catherine:** Peanut. 
    
    _He goes to the vending machine in the corridor.  She follows._ 
    
    **Catherine:** I should have seen this coming.  I mean, the guy
               practically had a coronary when I brought a toothbrush over
               to keep at his apartment.
      **Frasier:**[_handing over packet_] Here.
    **Catherine:** Thank you.  You want one?
      **Frasier:** Ah, no thanks.  Ah, why don't you have a seat here. [_indicates
               chair_]
    **Catherine:** Thank you. [_sits crossed-legged_]
      **Frasier:** But listen, if... if he was that resistant, why did you stay
               with him?
    **Catherine:** I had a lot invested in him.
      **Frasier:** Yes, but that's no reason to settle for someone who isn't madly
               in love with you.
    **Catherine:** Well, right now I'm not sure there are any men out there who
               are actually capable of falling madly in love.
      **Frasier:** Of course there are.  You know, at the most basic level men and
               women are the same.  We both need to be loved, and to love someone,
               we both want to feel that we matter to someone and that someone
               matters to us.  And making a commitment to another human being
               is the ultimate expression of our humanity.	 
    **Catherine:** Wow.  Your wife is really lucky.
      **Frasier:** I'm sure she'd say the same thing, especially now that our
               marriage is over... well, maybe I will have one of those M&M;'s.
               [_takes packet, helps himself_]
    **Catherine:** Oh, boy.  Why are relationships always so hard?  Hey, [_indicating
               Frasier's choice of M &M;_] you like the yellow ones too, huh?
      **Frasier:** Yeah.  You know, people try to tell you they're the same but...
    **Catherine:** I know.
      **Frasier:** But they're not.
    **Catherine:** No.
      **Frasier:** Well, you know, relationships don't always have to be so hard.
               I remember back in med school, I heard of a documented case
               where a man and a woman met, got along, and actually lived
               happily ever after.
    **Catherine:** Yeah, I don't mind the happily ever after part.  It's the dating
               part.  If I have to tell one more stranger the fascinating story
               of my life over more Italian cuisine I'm gonna choke on a
               breadstick!
      **Frasier:**[_laughs, then sits crossed-legged as well, mimicking her_] I know.
               You know, I just keep thinking that maybe we can just resume this
               over appetizers. 
    **Catherine:** Oh, no, no.  Half the time I'm ready to exchange goodbyes
               over appetizers.
      **Frasier:** Well, at least you don't get stuck with the bill.
    **Catherine:** God, you haven't dated much lately, have you?
      **Frasier:** No.  I usually end up in restaurants alone.
    **Catherine:** Oh, I can't do that.  I even have to turn on the TV at home
               so at least it feels that there's someone else in the room.
      **Frasier:** Is that what you'll be doing tonight?
    **Catherine:**[_eats an M &M; from Frasier's hand_] Well, unless I just keep
               eating M&M;'s, which is a distinct possibility.
    
    _Frasier finishes the packet in one go.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **KISS ME, KATE**
    
    _Scene Four: Cafe Nervosa. 
    Frasier and Catherine are sitting at a table.  She is reading his palm._
    
      **Frasier:** "Soft and supple, yet strong, right down to the beautiful almond-
               shaped nails."  You really see all of that in my hand?
    **Catherine:** Mmm.  I'm late.  I gotta go to work.
      **Frasier:** Oh, wait, wait.  We haven't decided what we're gonna do tonight.
               Ah, Antonio's?  Le Cigar Volante?
    **Catherine:** We've gone out for the last three nights, why don't we just
               stay in, huh?
      **Frasier:** That's a great idea.  I'll tell you what.  I'll uh, send dad and
               Daphne off to the movies.  I'll cook for you.  Be at my place at
               eight.
    **Catherine:** Oh, I won't be able to make it 'til eight-thirty, I gotta
               change, okay?
      **Frasier:** Oh, no-no-no-no.  Don't ever change - I like you just the way
               you are. [_everybody in the Cafe groans; to group:_] Oh, come on,
               come on, I'm a little out of practice.
    **Catherine:** I'll see you later, okay? 
    
    [_They kiss... a long kiss.  Long enough for Niles to see them through 
    the window._] 
    
    **Catherine:** Bye.
    
    _She exits, Niles enters.  He joins Frasier_
    
      **Niles:** I'll dispense with the usual adolescent teasing and come straight
             to the point: who was that babe-o-rama?!
    **Frasier:** Niles, please don't try to be hip.  You remind me of Bob Hope
             when he dresses up as the Fonz.
      **Niles:**[_to waitress_] Coffee.
    **Frasier:** Her name is Catherine.
      **Niles:** So?  How long have you known her?
    **Frasier:** Three days.
      **Niles:** Have you two, uh...?
    **Frasier:** No.  As if it's any of your business.
      **Niles:** But you're, uh..?
    **Frasier:** Well, yes.  Soon.
      **Niles:**[_nods, then, unsure:_] We are talking about...?
    **Frasier:** Of course we are.
      **Niles:**[_still unsure:_] ...Sex, right?
    **Frasier:** Yes!
      **Niles:**[_his coffee arrives_] Ooh, so-so-so... how did you two meet?
    **Frasier:** Well, I mean, it was one of those funny things, she came down
             to the radio station to chew me out.
      **Niles:**[_picks up sugar packet and starts shaking it_] You're kidding.
    **Frasier:** No.  A few days earlier her boyfriend had called into the show,
             and I advised him to break up with her.
    
    _The sugar goes everywhere as Niles gives an involuntary jerk._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, Frasier, where are your ethics?  You can't date someone
             who's involved with one of your patients.
    **Frasier:** Marco is not a patient, he's a caller.  There's a huge difference.
             Besides, I talked to him days before I met Catherine.
      **Niles:** Mmm, rationalization - the last refuge of the unsound argument.
    **Frasier:** Oh, rationalization, is that what you're going pull now? 
    
    _They argue for a few moments._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Niles, I am not rationalizing!  There is nothing wrong here.
      **Niles:** As long as your conscience is clear.  I'm not sure mine would
             be.
    **Frasier:** Well frankly, I don't care about your conscience.  I don't need
             your approval, I don't need you to like it.  Frankly, I don't
             need you for anything. [_gets ready to leave_] By the way, Niles,
             my car's in the shop, I need you to give me a ride home tonight.
      **Niles:** No problem.
    
    _End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two._
    
    **HE'S BAACK**
    
    _Scene One: The radio station, Roz's booth. 
    Frasier enters from corridor._
    
        **Roz:** Twenty seconds. And I've got news for you: Marco's on line two.
    **Frasier:**[_feigning ignorance_] Marco?
        **Roz:** Oh, you know.  The guy you got out of the way so you could keep
             his girlfriend for yourself? [_Frasier goes into the recording
             booth_] Ten seconds.
    **Frasier:** I'm not talking to him.  I don't want to talk to him.  There's
             no way I'm talking to him.
        **Roz:** Three, two...
    **Frasier:**[_on air_] Hi, we're back.  Roz, whom do we have on the line?
        **Roz:** We have Marco on line two.
    **Frasier:** Who's this on line three?
        **Roz:** Ooh, Todd. [_disconnects line_] Oh darn, we lost Todd. [_Frasier
             is not amused_] But lucky for you we still have Marco on line
             two.
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Roz. [_to caller_] Hello, Marco.
      **Marco:** Hi, Dr. Crane.  I spoke to you the other day and I took your advice.
             I broke up with my girlfriend.
    **Frasier:** Well, what can I say but, ah... Bravo, Marco!  Roz, who's our next
             caller?
    
    _We cut to Niles, driving in his car.  We can hear Marco through 
    his radio._
    
    **Marco:**[_on radio:_] Wait, wait-wait-wait.  You haven't heard my problem.  
           I think she's already dating someone else.  It really 
           makes me nuts.
    
    _Cut to studio:_
    
    **Frasier:** What makes you think she's seeing someone else?
      **Marco:** Well, the other night I couldn't get her on the phone.  So I
             drove by her house, and I saw her parked outside talking to
             some guy in a black BMW.
    **Frasier:** Did you, ah... get a good look at the guy?
      **Marco:** No.  It was too dark.  I think I made a big mistake, Doc.  Do you
             think I should ask her to take me back?
    **Frasier:** No!  What I mean is, ah... no.  Marco, you don't want your ex-
             girlfriend back, you just don't want anybody else to have her. 
             Isn't that true?
      **Marco:** Well, I...
    **Frasier:** No, it's called jealousy, Marco.  Now you've got to stop spying
             on your ex-girlfriend and get on with your life.  Borrow a page
             from my book - ah, move to a new city, a new state.  Find out
             why everybody's talking about Pittsburgh! 
    
    _In his car, Niles is shocked. 
    
    In the studio, Frasier hangs up on Marco._ 
    
    **Frasier:** We'll be right back after these messages. 
    
    _He goes to commercial, looks over and sees Roz glaring at him._ 
    
    **Frasier:** What?!
    _FADE TO:_
    **HOW AM I DRIVING?**
    
    _Scene Two: Niles's car. 
    He has just picked up Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** Thanks for coming to get me, Niles.
      **Niles:** No problem, Frasier.  Just a few miles out of my way.  At rush
             hour.  But I didn't mind, really.  Gave me a chance to listen
             to your show. [_looks pointedly at Frasier_]
    **Frasier:** I see.
      **Niles:** I just have one question for you: can you honestly tell me that
             the advice you gave Marco was based on his best interests and
             not on your own?
    **Frasier:** Well, that's an interesting question, Niles.  And I'll tell you
             something.  I don't care.  I'm in love, and I don't care.  Catherine
             is mine now.  I'm in, and Marco's out.
      **Niles:** You're insane.
    **Frasier:** Perhaps.  But you just ran a stop sign. [_Niles slams on the brakes_] 
             Now we're in the middle of the intersection. [_car horns blare,
             Niles drives on_] I'll tell you, Niles, I, ah... I haven't 
             Felt this way in ages.  There's an excitement about this.  
             I, I feel tingly.
      **Niles:** What's your stomach have to say about this?
    **Frasier:** My stomach?
      **Niles:** I definitely know what I'm talking about.  Ever since you were 
             a child, if you even approached a breach of ethics you'd get
             queasy.  Actually, you'd get physically sick.
    **Frasier:** Well, at least when it came to ethics I didn't get spontaneous
             nosebleeds.
      **Niles:** Remember the time we lifted that dollar bill from mom's change
             purse?  We left quite a gruesome trail back to the tree house
             that day.
    **Frasier:** Ah, but you see, Niles, you've proved my point.  I'm not the
             least bit queasy, I'm fine.  My head, my heart, my gastrointestinal
             system, they're all shouting the same thing - It's okay! [_looks
             around_] Niles?  Niles, this is a new car?
      **Niles:** Yes, actually it is.  Patient of mine got me a huge break on
             a lease. [_puts his finger to his nose_] Frasier, do you have
             a handkerchief?
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE OBLIGATORY SEX SCENE**
    
    _Scene Three: Frasier's Apartment. 
    He and Catherine have just finished their meal and are clearing up._
    
    **Catherine:** Mmm. That was the most delicious salmon Marseilles I've ever
               tasted.
      **Frasier:** Well, maybe you should try my "salmon-chanted evening."
    **Catherine:** Oh, no.  Tell me you didn't say that.
      **Frasier:** No, it was just the Laffite talking.  "Laffite don't fail me now."
    **Catherine:** C'mon, stop, stop. 
    
    _Catherine gets up and follows him into the kitchen, where he is 
    washing their plates in the sink._
    
    **Catherine:** So, have you ever made love in the kitchen?
      **Frasier:**[_he drops and smashes a plate in the sink_] Well, the ah, 
               dishes are done.
    
    _They kiss, ending up on the floor.  From behind the cooktop we hear..._
    
    **Catherine:** Mmm, ah, ah...
      **Frasier:** Mmm, oh, ah... [_then:_] Aaugh! [_he stands up_]
    **Catherine:** What was that?
      **Frasier:** I'm sorry.  I'm suddenly feeling a little queasy.  Maybe I'm 
               just not a kitchen person. 
    
    _He goes into the living room.  Catherine follows._
    
    **Catherine:** Well ah, maybe you're just a little too warm, huh? [_starts
               to unbutton his shirt_] Yeah?
      **Frasier:** Well, yeah. 
    **Catherine:** Oh, God...
      **Frasier:** Yeah, that's it.  You know, you look awfully warm too. 
    **Catherine:** Oh, I am.
      **Frasier:**[_unbuttons her blouse_] Oh, my God.
    **Catherine:** Yes, oh...
    
    _They embrace again, falling onto Martin's chair.  It starts to
    vibrate. Frasier whacks it and it ceases._
    
      **Frasier:** I'm sorry.  Would you... would you mind if we, if we moved to
               the sofa?  I'm not going to be out-performed by a Barcalounger.
    **Catherine:** No. [_they move, Frasier carrying Catherine_]
      **Frasier:** Oh, this is good.
    **Catherine:** Yes, it is.
      **Frasier:** This is better
    **Catherine:** Oh...
    
    _They get down to it again, until inevitably..._
    
      **Frasier:** Eee-ugh!
    **Catherine:** What?!  Was I kneeling on you?
      **Frasier:** Really, maybe I need some fresh air. [_moves to balcony_]
               Are you okay?
    **Catherine:** Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
      **Frasier:** Oh damn, it wasn't the fish!
    **Catherine:** You know there's a bug going round.
      **Frasier:** It's not a bug. 
    **Catherine:** Well what is it, then?
      **Frasier:** It's us.  Every time we touch and kiss I get queasy.
    **Catherine:** What are you telling me?  That the thought of making love to
               me makes you sick to your stomach?
      **Frasier:** Yes, but don't take it personally! 
    **Catherine:**[_sarcastic_] Well, why would I?
      **Frasier:** It's, it's not you.  Ah, it's, it's me.  Every time I come 
               close to breaching my ethics, I-I end up getting sick.
    **Catherine:** What are you talking about?
      **Frasier:** Marco called into the show today and... he said he was 
               thinking of getting back with you and I told him not to. 
    **Catherine:** So?
      **Frasier:** Well, I just have a feeling that... maybe I told him that not
               because it was good for him, but because it was good for me.
    **Catherine:** Oh, Frasier, who cares? [_kisses him_]
      **Frasier:** Well, I do.  I care.  You know?  Look, any psychiatrist worth 
               his salt would care.  That's why we don't get involved with our 
               patients.  Or their girlfriends.
    **Catherine:** Are you, are you saying you want to break up with me?
      **Frasier:** No, I don't want to.  I have to.  If I don't, I'll throw up 
               all over your shoes.
    **Catherine:** I can't believe this is happening.  God, how can this be so
               easy for you?
      **Frasier:** Easy?!  This is killing me!  You think I don't want to pick you
               up right now, carry you over to that Eames classic and show you
               why it's the best-engineered chair in the world?!
    **Catherine:** Well, why don't you then?
      **Frasier:** I told you, I can't.
    **Catherine:** Oh!  And nothing I can say will change your mind?
      **Frasier:** I'm sorry.
    **Catherine:** Well thank you, Dr. Crane!  First you screw things up with
               Marco, and now you're dumping me?  God!  And to think I was 
               going to have sex with you. [_twisting the knife_] And it was 
               going to be hot.  Oh, like you've never had before.  I'm 
               talking raw, steamy, sweat-dripping-down-your-back, neighbors-
               pounding-on-the-wall, ILLEGAL-IN-FORTY-EIGHT-STATES-KIND-OF-SEX!  
               But, hey!  You're okay, you won't be alone tonight.  No, you've 
               got your ETHICS! 
    
    _She picks up her coat and goes to the door._ 
    
    **Catherine:** Oh, by the way... the fish was dry. [_exits_]	 
      **Frasier:** Oh, that was a cheap shot! 
    
    _He goes and sits on his Eames.  Eddie joins him._ 
    
    **Frasier:** How I envy you, Eddie.  The biggest questions you face are 
             "who's going to walk me?"  "Who's going to feed me?"  I won't 
             know that kind of joy for another forty years.
    
    _End Of Act Two._
