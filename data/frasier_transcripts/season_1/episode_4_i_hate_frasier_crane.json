[_sarcastic:_] What trenchant criticism.  Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town.  One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef t'ouerve: \"I Hate Frasier Crane.\"  A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show.  No, not our Mr. Mann.  So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it.  For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals.  And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
