As many of you know, my sixty-three  year old father recently moved in with me and, just this  morning over coffee, I discovered he had spent the night in  his room with a delightful creature named Elaine.  The entire  episode completely unnerved me.  Why?  Because I had never  thought of my father as a man with normal sexual urges.  To me he was always old plain old Dad.  Well, that's absurd.  My father is a witty, virile, charming man, possessed of the  hereditary Crane good looks, and what I suppose I'm driving  at is, that sexuality is a healthy part of adulthood, at any  age.
