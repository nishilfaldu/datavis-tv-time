    _**Skyline:** The Seattle sky line is drawn with no extras.
    
    Act One. 
    
    Scene One -- KACL
    Frasier and Roz in their respective booths, the show is going on._
    
    **Frasier:** Gee, I'm sorry, Blake.  When I told you to close your eyes
             and visualize that you were on a tropical island, I didn't
             realize you were calling from your car phone. 
    
    _The camera pans to Roz, who looks mildly horrified._
    
      **Blake:**[_v.o._] That's OK, Doc.  At least I know my airbags work.
    **Frasier:**[_laughs uncomfortably_] Well, I'm glad you're alright.  
             And thank you for your call.
    
    _Gil Chesterton edges open the door and slides into the booth. 
    He waves and mouths "Hi."_ 
    
    **Frasier:** Well, look who's popped into the booth!  It's Gil Chesterton,
             KACL's own food critic - which means, it's my cue to hit
             the road.  So, till tomorrow, this is Dr. Frasier Crane,
             wishing you... [_starts to sneeze_] a good day... [_sneezes_] 
             and-and good health.
    _He goes off the air.  Gil comes in with his hands behind his back.
    Roz enters the booth._
    
        **Gil:**[_motherly_] Hey, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Hello, Gil.
        **Gil:** I heard you coughing on the air earlier today.  Sounds like
             you might be coming down with something.  So I had this sent
             over from Rosenthal's Deli. [_hands Frasier a white paper bag_] 
             Chicken soup, so lovingly prepared even the chicken gets well.
    **Frasier:** Thank you.  That's very kind.
        **Gil:** And of course I'd never forget you, Roz. [_hands her a smaller 
             bag_] Some ladyfingers, that have been soaked in rum.
        **Roz:** Mmm!
    **Frasier:** Much like her own. 
    
    _He coughs repeatedly and loudly, ignoring Roz's offended look._
    
        **Gil:** I say, I hope this isn't the start of that nasty flu that's
             going around.  You want to take a couple of days off, nip it
             in the bud, I'd be happy to cover your time slot for you.
    **Frasier:** No, no, thank you.  I'll be fine tomorrow.
        **Gil:** Okey-dokey.  But, uh... feel free to call me if you change
             your mind.
    
    _He leaves, as Roz bites into a ladyfinger._
    
        **Roz:** Mmm!  Plump, gooey, and guaranteed to rot your teeth.
    **Frasier:** Yes.  I don't like his phony British accent much, either.
        **Roz:** You sure got a bug up your mind about Gil.  What's your
             problem?
    **Frasier:** I just don't trust him.  Nobody's that nice unless they want
             something from you.
    _Roz picks up something from the table and heads back to her booth._
    
        **Roz:** He's just a generous person.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yes! [_getting up and following her_] He was very generous
             to Bonnie Weems!  Bought her a case of wine, asked her to let
             him have her timeslot when she was off on vacation.  When she 
             got back, she had been banished to the midnight to four a.m.
             slot!
        **Roz:** What are you saying?  He's trying to take our timeslot?
    **Frasier:** I'm just saying we should watch our backs.  How would you
             like to work from midnight to four a.m.?  What would happen
             to your social life?  Those are your peak hours! [_smirks_]
        **Roz:** You're just being paranoid.
    **Frasier:** No, I'm not. [_returns to his booth_]
        **Roz:**[_following him_] Yes, you are!  The man brought you some
             chicken soup.  It does not mean he wants your timeslot.
             Besides, why would he be bribing us?  He'd be bribing the
             higher-ups, they're the ones who make the decisions!
    
    _At that moment, Gil enters with another paper bag._
    
        **Gil:** Frasier! [_sees the first bag_] Oh good, it's still here.  
             I'm so sorry.  This is your soup. [_hands him the bag in 
             his hand and takes the one off the console_] This is the 
             Lobster Newburg I bought for the station manager's cat.
    
    _He leaves.  Frasier, vindicated, throws a knowing look at Roz._
    
    **Frasier:** I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
    
    _He grabs his briefcase off the console and leaves.
    
    FADE OUT_
    
    **SPRING IS IN THE AIR**
    
    _Scene Two - Frasier's apartment
    Martin and Daphne are seated at the table, both reading from the 
    newspaper._
     **Daphne:** Oh, here's a gruesome bit.  A partly-decomposed body just
             washed up in Puget Sound!
     **Martin:** Hey, that's good news!
     **Daphne:**[_shocked_] I beg your pardon?
     **Martin:** Bodies don't rise till the weather gets warmer.  You get your
             first floater, and spring's just around the corner! 
    
    _Daphne looks suitably disgusted.
    
    Frasier enters from his bedroom, clumsily dressed and looking 
    extremely tired._
    
    **Frasier:**[_listlessly_] Morning, Dad, Daphne.
     **Martin:** Frasier, you sound awful!
    **Frasier:**[_unconvincingly_] It's just a little bug.
     **Daphne:** But you can't be thinking of going to work!  You're all pasty
             and clammy and pale!
     **Martin:** And coming from an English person, that's bad!
    _Daphne, offended, picks up the breakfast dishes and marches into 
    the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:** Don't worry, Dad.  As you've often said, "if you can walk, 
             you can work."  Took kind of an ironic twist the day you 
             got shot in the hip!
     **Martin:** Well, at least I had a real job.  Half your listening
             audience hears voices already, and the other half talks to
             themselves!  If you don't show up, who's going to notice?
    **Frasier:** Well, I'm out of here. 
    
    _He puts down his mug and walks over to the coat rack.  Daphne runs
    after him from the kitchen._
    
     **Daphne:** But you're burning up!  You really should stay home and 
             let me tend to you.  I'm a very good nurse.  I mended all 
             my brothers' soccer injuries.
    **Frasier:**[_shrugging into his coat_] Well, I didn't get injured playing
             soccer.
     **Daphne:** Neither did my hooligan brothers.  Mostly they got hurt
             beating up drunken Dutchmen in the stands. 
    
    _Frasier sneezes explosively._
    
     **Martin:**[_folding his arms_] Well, that's going to look pretty against
             the glass in your booth!  Why don't you just stay home?
    **Frasier:** Dad, Daphne, thank you, thank you.  But I'm a physician. 
             I believe that I am the best monitor of my own condition.  
             I'm fine!  Fit as a fiddle!
    
    _He pulls open the door and exits. 
    
    Beat. 
    
    The doorbell sounds, languidly and tiredly.  Daphne, who has turned 
    away, returns expectantly to the door and opens it to reveal a very 
    sick Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:**[_whining_] I'm sick...!
    
    _Daphne supports Frasier as he trudges back into the living room.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Three -- KACL
    Gil is on the air, doing his show in Frasier's timeslot._ 
    
        **Gil:** And we're back, with "Restaurant Beat."  This is Gil 
             Chesterton and I'm filling in for Dr. Frasier Crane.  
             We're here talking to Louis, who has forgotten that 
             tonight is his tenth anniversary.  Well, Louis, I 
             believe I've saved your proverbial _derriere_!  During 
             the commercial, I managed to secure you a private booth 
             at Maximillian's.  Just promise me for dessert you'll 
             have their _Schwarzw�lder Kirschtorte_.
      **Louis:** The... the what?
        **Gil:** The _Schwarzw�lder_... [_condescendingly_] well, maybe 
             you'd better stick with the rainbow sherbet.
      **Louis:** I don't know how to thank you.  You saved my marriage!
        **Gil:** No, don't thank me!  I'm only here tonight because our dear 
             Dr. Crane is home with the flu.
    _The scene changes to Frasier's room.  Frasier is lying in bed with
    a thermometer in his mouth.  He is listening to Gil on a radio above 
    his bed.  Martin reads the newspaper in a chair by the bed._
    
        **Gil:**[_on radio_] If you're listening, Doc, all of us here 
             at KACL want you to get better soon.
    **Frasier:**[_mumbling around the thermometer_] I just bet you do.
    
    _Daphne comes out of the bathroom._
    
     **Daphne:** Time to check if the turkey's done. [_she takes out the
             thermometer_]
    **Frasier:** Dad, you know, you don't have to sit in here with me all
             day.
     **Martin:** Oh no, no problem.  You need company when you're sick.  You
             never know when you're going to croak.
     **Daphne:** Oh, boy.  Your temperature is up there - one hundred and one!
             You are a sick boy.
    **Frasier:** Thank you for reminding me, Daphne.
     **Martin:** Naw, I remember the sickest I ever was.  They'd shipped us
             back from Korea.  I got this Oriental parasite, that was
             building its own little pagoda right in my colon...
    **Frasier:** Thank you, Dad.
     **Daphne:** You know, you might try some of my homeopathic tea.  It'll
             flush out your system, and it'll also make your hair more
             shiny and manageable. 
    _She fluffs her own hair, while sterilizing the thermometer with alcohol._
    
    **Frasier:** No, no thank you.
     **Martin:** Oh, no!  That wasn't the sickest I was.  It was that time 
             Your mother and I took that trip down to Mexico.  I was real
             careful about the water, and then I ate this piece of lettuce.  
             Next thing you know, I'm spewing both for accuracy and 
             distance.  I spent the night curled up on the stone floor, 
             screaming, "I want to die, I want to die!"
    **Frasier:** Wouldn't that have been a tragedy?  You wouldn't be here with 
             me now!
     **Martin:** OK, I get the point.  I'll give you a little peace and quiet
             here. [_gets up and starts to leave_] Oh, no!  What was I
             thinking of?  What about the time your mother left the potato
             salad in the trunk of the car?  I'm still sick from that one!
    
    _Martin leaves.  Daphne carries a tray to the door._
    
     **Daphne:**[_pleasantly_] Is there anything else you need?
    **Frasier:** A little more ginger ale, please.
     **Daphne:** Very well, then. 
    
    _She turns to leave but he calls her back._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh Daphne, this time make it shaved ice, not cubes.  And I
             don't like those straws.  Can I have the bendy kind?  And the
             saltines, they're too salty.  I need the low-sodium.
     **Daphne:** Your wish is my command.
    
    _She turns to leave again.  This time, she is stopped by Niles, 
    who is just entering the room._ 
    
      **Niles:** Hello, Daphne.  Is he in pain?
     **Daphne:** Not enough. 
    _She exits.  Niles bends over Frasier, covering his mouth with his
    handkerchief._
      **Niles:** Frasier, I brought you something.
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Put the hanky down, for God's sake!  It's not the
             plague!
    _Niles does, carefully folding the handkerchief and placing it on the
    bed before sitting down.  He's carrying a plastic bag with a slime-
    green pouch inside, with a lanyard around it._
    
      **Niles:** Well, look.  This is from Marta, our maid.  It's a poultice 
             you wear around your neck.  The recipe comes from her remote 
             mountain village in Guatemala.
    **Frasier:**[_catches a whiff_] I can see why her village is remote!
      **Niles:** Well yes, it is pungent. [_drapes it around Frasier's neck_] 
             But, by inhaling these herbs, many of the villagers live to be 
             well over a hundred.  Marta herself is seventy-eight, and you 
             should see her scramble up the stairs when Maris rings her 
             little bell.
    
    _The phone rings._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, Niles, would you mind?
      **Niles:** Of course.
    
    _Obligingly, Niles gets off the bed and walks to the phone. 
    Eddie scampers into the room and bounces up onto Frasier's 
    bed next to him._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, hello Eddie!  For once I'm actually glad to see you!  
             Here. 
    
    _He drapes the poultice around the dog's neck.  Horrified, Eddie 
    runs out of the room.  Frasier laughs to himself.
    
    Niles returns to the bed, phone in hand._
    
      **Niles:**[_returning to the bed, phone in hand_] Uh, it's for you.
             It's - Roz?
    **Frasier:**[_taking the phone and speaking weakly_] Hello.
        **Roz:** So, how are you feeling?
    **Frasier:** Awful, thank you.
    
    _Reset to: we see Roz standing at the payphone outside the studio, 
    as Gil still goes on with his show._
    
        **Roz:** Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  Because I really think you 
             should get your butt back down here.  You were right about 
             Gil, Frasier.  He's lobbying for our slot.  I was talking to
             Millie in Traffic and she overheard Gil talking to the station 
             manager.  It was all about how our timeslot is perfect for his 
             show because it's mid-afternoon and everyone is making [_posh 
             accent_] dinner plans!
    **Frasier:** I knew it, I knew it!  Geez... OK, Roz, you can count on me. 
             I'll be there tomorrow.
        **Roz:** Well, you'd better be!  I don't trust that greedy, finger-
             Licking runt as far as I can throw him.
        **Gil:**[_sticking his head out of the booth_] I say, Roz, how am I
             doing so far?
        **Roz:**[_fake_] Fabulous!
    
    _Reset to: Frasier's room._
    
    **Frasier:** OK, I'll be in tomorrow.
    _He hangs up the receiver, and Niles replaces the phone on the desk._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, you can't be serious about going in tomorrow.  Your
             pupils are dilated. [_he touches his brother's forehead_] You
             have a fever.  
    
    _He wets a cotton swab with the alcohol and meticulously cleans 
    his hands._
    
      **Niles:** You go in in that condition, you won't even make it to the... 
    **Frasier:** Oh, I just don't trust Gil Chesterton.  I think he's after my
             timeslot. [_exasperated_] Oh Niles, will you stop it with the
             alcohol!
    
    _Niles reluctantly places the cotton wool into the plastic bag that 
    once held the poultice._
    
    **Frasier:** I just can't let that smarmy little chowhound do my show for
             another day!  Oh God, anybody would be better! [_inspiration
             strikes_] Niles, Niles, would you do my show for me?
      **Niles:** Frasier, I think that fever of yours is making you delusional.
    **Frasier:** Oh, no!  I filled in for you when you were too sick to meet
             with your "Fear of Intimacy" group!
      **Niles:**[_heading into the bathroom_] I wasn't sick.  They were just
             getting too close.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I guess you're right.  It's probably a bad idea.  Doing my
             show requires a set of abilities that you just don't possess.  
             You have to be able to size up your patients very quickly, and 
             then dispense your advice in an entertaining and insightful 
             manner.
      **Niles:**[_re-entering the room_] Frasier, this pathetic attempt at 
             reverse psychology is beneath you.
    **Frasier:**[_knowingly_] Then you're not going to do my show?
      **Niles:**[_defiantly_] No, I AM going to do your show, and I'm going to
             do it better than you ever DREAMED of doing it!
    
    _Niles walks out, and Frasier is happy -- until Eddie scampers in
    with the poultice in his teeth.  He drops it back onto Frasier's 
    chest then scampers out again.  Frasier stares after him venomously.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- KACL
    Roz and Niles are in Frasier's booth.  She is showing him around 
    the control panel._
    
        **Roz:**[_pointing_] And here's the cough button in case you need to
             cough or clear your throat. [_holds up a blue cart_] And most
             important, here's an extra-long commercial to use if you need
             a bathroom break.
      **Niles:** Thank you, but those won't be necessary.  I have no cough
             reflex, and excellent bladder control.
        **Roz:**[_sarcastically deadpan_] It's true - all the good ones ARE
             married. [_leaving for her booth_] You're on in ten seconds 
             and your first caller is Marcia.
      **Niles:** Marcia... 
    _He places the headphones around his neck and sits down, covering the 
    mike with his hand.  Clearing his throat, he tries out catchphrases._
      **Niles:** "Hello, Marcia, I'm listening."  That is so trite.  "Hello, 
             Marcia, tell me where it hurts." No, no... "Hello, Marcia, 
             I hear you."  No...
    _Roz points to him.  Not understanding, he points back to her,
    while continuing to mutter to himself.  Roz points at him again,
    more urgently.  He still doesn't understand that he is on._
    
        **Roz:**[_speaking into her mike_] Good afternoon, Seattle!
      **Niles:** Oh, yes! [_puts on his headphones_] Hello!  This is Dr. Niles 
             Crane, filling in for my ailing brother, Dr. Frasier Crane.  
             Although I feel perfectly qualified to fill Frasier's radio 
             shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, 
             I am a Jungian.  So there'll be no blaming Mother today. 
    
    _He is proud of himself for having gotten thus far, and doesn't
    notice Roz sigh and sink back into her chair._ 
    
      **Niles:** Ooh-kay, Roz, who's my first caller?
        **Roz:** We have Marcia on line three.  She's in love with her 
             husband's brother.
      **Niles:** This day promises not to disappoint. [_jabs a button 
             professionally_] Hello, Marcia.  "Let's get better!"
    
    _Pleased with himself, he gives Roz a "how's that?" shrug.
    Surprised, she gives him a "hey, not bad" signal back.
    
    Reset to: Frasier's bedroom.  He is listening to the radio as 
    Daphne takes his temperature again, laughing at Niles's performance._
    
      **Niles:**[_on radio_] But before we get into the specifics of your 
             problem, why don't I give you a little historical background?  
             The psychiatrist Sigmar Bromnoh - that's B-R-O-M-N-O-H - in
             the late 1950s, wrote extensively on the problem you are 
             facing.  Which is all the more amazing when you realise that
             Bromnoh was a prominent Reichian, although...
    **Frasier:**[_gleefully_] Listen to him!  He's terrible! 
    
    _He shuts off the radio.  Daphne removes the thermometer._
    
     **Daphne:** And, I'm afraid, so are you.  Your temperature's up to one
             hundred and three.
    **Frasier:** Oh, it could go up to a hundred and five, I couldn't be 
             better!  My timeslot is safe.  Niles is as dry as this 
             toast you brought me - with the crust still on.  I'm 
             sure when I'm ready to go back, they'll send a limo!
     **Daphne:** Well, I'll just go get you another drink.  Was that last straw 
             bendy enough?
    **Frasier:** Perfect, thank you. [_she starts to leave_] Oh Daphne, Daphne, 
             look. [_points at a tissue box on the bed next to him_] Here, 
             take these tissues away.  I, they hurt my nose.  I want that 
             kind with the little moisturizer droplet between the sheets.  
             And the rose petals in the humidifier - I think they're 
             starting to wilt.
     **Daphne:** Oh, of course.  Anything you like.  Fresh rose petals, 
             crust-less toast, soft tissues... [_turning to leave,
             muttering bitterly_] acupuncture needles where you least
             expect them...
    
    _End Of Act One (Time: 10:05)
    
    Act Two. 
    
    Scene One - KACL 
    Niles is pacing the booth, with his jacket off and his shirtsleeves 
    rolled up.  He is holding the mike and speaking animatedly into it._
    
      **Niles:** Howard, Lois, I could stay on the air counseling you all day,
             but -- [_glances at the clock_] we're coming to the end of our
             hour, so I'm just going to cut to the quick.  If one of you 
             doesn't say, "I love you" right now - _right now_ - frankly, 
             I don't see how you could have any kind of future together.  
             So, which of you has the courage to say, "I love you?"
    
    _In her booth, Roz is impressed; Niles has gotten pretty good._
    
       **Lois:**[_v.o._] Howard... I love you.
      **Niles:**[_thrilled_] Yes!  Yes!  Howard, she loves you!  What about you? 
     **Howard:**[_v.o._] I, uh...
      **Niles:** Howard?  Are you going to just pack up your emotional tent and
             walk away... Howard?  Howard, it's up to you!  Can you say 
             it?!  Can you?!
        **Roz:**[_caught up in the excitement_] Come on, Howard!  Come on,
             Howard!
     **Howard:** I... I love you too, Lois!
        **Roz:** YES!
    
    _SMASH CUT TO: Frasier's bedroom, where the three members of the 
    Crane household are listening to Niles's triumphant broadcast.
    
    Martin, in his chair by the bed, laughs.  Daphne happily jumps on 
    Frasier's back -- which she can do because Frasier is face-down on
    the bed, writhing in envy.
    _ 
     **Daphne:** He said it, he said it!
      **Niles:**[_on radio_] But I'm afraid we're going to have to interrupt
             this radio moment with a commercial... [_Daphne turns off the 
             radio_]
     **Martin:** Hey, Niles is pretty good!
    **Frasier:** Good?   Good?!  The little rat is scintillating!  Oh, why 
             couldn't he just do what's expected of him for once and 
             stink?!  He's even better than Gil Chesterton!  Oh, God - 
             they're trying to make me look bad!
     **Martin:** Aw, geez.  This high temperature of yours is making you
             zooey.
    **Frasier:** No!  No!  It's made me clear-headed.  I've gotta get down 
             there, go to that station, reclaim what's rightfully mine!  
    
    _He struggles out of bed, and to his feet._
    
    **Frasier:** There'll be no more filling in by anybody!  No way, no how!
             No way, no...
     **Martin:**[_stands_] Frasier, you're not going anywhere.
    **Frasier:**[_facing off with his dad_] Oh, who's going to stop me?
     **Martin:** I am.
    **Frasier:** Oh, how are you - a man with a limp and a cane - going to stop
             a man in the prime of his life?
    _Martin pokes Frasier in the chest, and the latter falls pathetically
    back onto the bed, groaning loudly._
    
     **Martin:**[_over Frasier's whining_] And I wasn't even leaning on my cane.
             Come on, Daphne.
    _He beckons to Daphne, and they both start walking out of the room._
    
     **Daphne:** Boy, he really is sick.
     **Martin:** Huh!  You want to talk sick?  1962, World's Fair.  The Tilt-A-
             Whirl was right next to the "Little Taste Of India"...
    _FADE TO:_
    **I GO TO PIECES**
    
    _Scene Two -- KACL
    Frasier is back doing his show, with Roz in her booth._
    
    **Frasier:** As you know, I was out sick most of the week, and I'd like
             to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to
             Gil Chesterton and to my brother Niles for doing such a
             great job of filling in for me.
    _Oddly enough, Niles and Gil are both standing ominously at a half-
    screened window behind Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** I really appreciate it, guys.
    _Turning to the window, he waves cheerily.  Both Niles and Gil lift 
    their hands to return the wave at exactly the same time, looking 
    decidedly sinister._
    
    **Frasier:** Well Roz, now that I'm back to normal and feeling great,
             who's our first caller?
        **Roz:** We have Sonya from Auburn on line three.
    **Frasier:** Let's just hear what Sonya has to say... 
    _He presses a button on his console.  BANG!  A bomb under his chair
    explodes, vaporizing him.  Roz looks upwards, bewildered, as debris
    rains down on Frasier's console.
    
    SMASH CUT TO: Frasier's Bedroom
    Frasier (still sick), wakes up screaming._ 
    
    **Frasier:** DAPHNE!  DAPHNE!
    _Daphne storms in, having almost reached her limit._
     **Daphne:** What is it this time?!
    **Frasier:** I had a dream!  I had a dream!  They are plotting against me!
     **Daphne:** Oh, now now, Dr. Crane.  I thought we went over this already.
             It's just your fever talking!
    **Frasier:**[_suspiciously_] Oh, that's just what you want me to think! 
             You're probably in league with Niles!  I know about the two 
             of you!  Oh, you pretend not to know, but you know! 
    
    [_N.B. Frasier almost blew Niles's secret right here!!!  In fact, 
    Jane Leeves, who says she knows more about Daphne than the writers 
    who created her, always maintained that Daphne has always been 
    aware of Niles's feelings for her, but sublimates them out of 
    feelings of inferiority. -- Mike Lee_]
    _Frasier grabs his prescription pad off the desk and starts scribbling
    on it._
    
    **Frasier:** I've gotta get back down there and take my show back!
     **Daphne:** But you can barely function!
    **Frasier:** Yes, well, these prescriptions will take care of that 
             and more. [_rips off a slip and passes it to her_] Now 
             here, run down to the drugstore, post-haste!
     **Daphne:**[_reading it_] Syducane?!  This'll have you high as a kite!
    **Frasier:** That's only until I take a couple of these! 
    
    _He rips off another slip and gives it to her.  As he climbs out of
    bed, she reads it and her eyes widen._
    
    [_N.B. A play on the name of series writer Sy Dukane._]
    
     **Daphne:** Oh now, Dr. Crane, I really don't think you're in any shape...
    **Frasier:** Thank you!  But the moment I give a fig for what you think
             is the day that England produces a great chef, a world-class
             bottle of wine, and a car that has a decent electrical
             system!
    
    _And for Daphne, that's the limit._
    
     **Daphne:**[_furious_] You know, being a health-care provider, I try to
             be sympathetic towards my patients.  But I have reached the
             end of my tether with you, Doctor!  You are by far the most
             ungrateful, disagreeable, self-centered, whiny fusspot I've
             ever had the misfortune of dealing with!  I've had patients
             on their deathbeds who were more considerate, and a damn
             sight more jolly too!  As far as I'm concerned, you can lay 
             in those sweaty sheets until you're one giant bedsore!
    **Frasier:** Are you done?
     **Daphne:**[_calming down somewhat_] Yes.
    **Frasier:** Then scurry on down to the drugstore and get those filled
             while I get dressed!
    
    _He turns toward his closet, as Daphne stalks out of the bedroom.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **RADIO DAZE**
    
    _Scene Three - KACL
    Outside the studio, Gil is talking to another employee.  Frasier 
    walks in, unkempt and with a goofy smile on his face._ 
    
        **Gil:** Oh, Frasier!  What a surprise to see you here today!
    **Frasier:** Well, it's no wonder.  I've taken some wonder drugs, I feel
             wonderful! [_laughs_] So I'm going to go do my show now - so
             ta-ta, Pieman!
    _He pulls open the door and enters, as Gil looks confused and a 
    little alarmed.  Inside the booth, Niles is talking.  Roz notices 
    Frasier first._
     
      **Niles:** Thank you, Greta.  It's always satisfying to know I've
             changed someone's life. [_sees Roz signaling and looks_] 
             Oh, look who's just wandered into my booth, it's my 
             brother Frasier.
    **Frasier:** Hello, Niles.  I've come to take back the reins of my show,
             so you can just scoot out of there. [_Roz comes in_]
      **Niles:** I think this might be a good time to go to a commercial.
             [_tosses Roz the blue "extra-long" cart, she plugs it in_]
             This is Dr. Niles Crane, "let's get better."
    
    _He goes to commercial, pulls off his headphones, and stands._
    
        **Roz:**[_hesitantly_] You OK, Frasier?  Your eyes look a little
             glassy.
    **Frasier:**[_dismissively_] I'm fine!  It's just that the drugs I took
             have some minor slide effects...
    
    _He settles into his chair, as Roz and Niles trade an alarmed look.
    Roz grabs his chair and wheels him to face her._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier, look at me.  Do you see trails when I do this? 
    _She splays her fingers and passes her hand repeatedly across his eyes._
    **Frasier:** Whoa! [_laughs_] Ha!  It wasn't doing that before!
    
    _Niles holds Frasier's gaze steady by taking hold of his chin._
    
      **Niles:** Listen, you're not going on the air like this. [_shakes
             a finger in Frasier's face_] Stop it, stop... 
    _Niles realizes Frasier is bobbing his head in time with Niles's finger,
    and holds Frasier's chin more tightly._
    
      **Niles:** This is what you're going to do.  You're going to bed, you're 
             going to get rest, and you're going to get rid of this fever, 
             so you can be as good as new.  "Let's get better!"  All right? 
             [_removes his fingers_] All right?
    **Frasier:**[_docilely, seeming appeased_] All right... OK... 
    
    _He stands, Niles and Roz start to lead him out of the booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Maybe... maybe the two of you could help me find someone 
             to drive me home?
        **Roz:**[_opens the door_] Oh, that's the most sensible thing you've 
             said so far, Frasier-
    
    _He shoves them both out the door and locks it._
    
        **Roz:**[_yelling_] Frasier!  FRASIER!
    _She runs down the hall to her door even as Frasier rushes madly 
    across his booth into hers.  He locks her door too, laughing 
    wildly.
    
    Frasier sits back down in his chair as he pulls the headphone on.
    Roz and Niles look in helplessly after banging on the door a few
    more times._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Seattle, I'm back!  This is Dr. Frasier Crane. 
             I promise I  will never leave you again... so, let's 
             take our first caller. [_presses a button_] Hello, I'm 
             listening.
     **Robert:**[_v.o._] Hi, Dr. Crane.  Thanks for taking my call.  
             I'm a little nervous, okay?  My name is Robert.
    **Frasier:** And your name is?
     **Robert:**...My name is Robert.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'm sorry.  We've already had a Robert on the show today.
             Goodbye!
    _He presses a button to disconnect Robert.  Outside the booth, 
    Roz is on the office phone._
    
        **Roz:** Tony, it's Roz.  Could you get security up here?  Captain 
             Kirk's got control of the bridge and he's gone insane.
    _Inside the booth, Frasier is still on the air:_
    **Frasier:** Who is this?
     **Janice:** I'm Janice.
    **Frasier:** Well, Janice, what's your problem?
     **Janice:** Well, I'm having a problem breaking through a barrier with
             my in-laws.
    **Frasier:** Boring! 
    _He jabs another button and disconnects her, then picks up on another
    line._
    
     **Frasier:** Hello!  You're on the crane with Frasier Air!
    **Marjorie:** Hi, Dr. Crane.  This is Marjorie.  You see, I'm...
              I'm having a problem with my boss.  He doesn't seem to 
              respect me, and I don't have the courage to confront him.
     **Frasier:** OK, OK, Marjorie.  Well, let's, let's see... Let's do a
              little role-playing, OK?  Look, I'll be your boss, you be
              yourself, you be Marjorie... and uh - come on in and talk
              to me in a very forceful way.  Tell me what you think, and
              you just might be surprised by what happens!
    **Marjorie:** Well, OK.  "Listen, Mr. Ross.  I've worked for this company
              for six years and I've never missed a day.  But you've
              constantly promoted people less qualified than I am, 
              and I don't think that's fair."
    
    _As she speaks, Frasier makes a shooing motion with his right hand
    and presumably starts seeing trails again.  He keeps waving his hand
    until she stops talking._
    
     **Frasier:** "Well, Marjorie, I must say I admire your forthrightness,
              and uh... I wished more of my employees came and spoke to
              me with an open mind.  You know, you're going to get that
              promotion!"
    **Marjorie:** Hey, that was great!
     **Frasier:**[_excited_] Yeah!  Wasn't it?  Wasn't it?  OK, it's my turn!
              I'm Marjorie and you're the boss now!  Come on!  Come on...
    
    _At this point, the door has been forced open and Niles comes in with
    some uniformed security guards._ 
    
      **Niles:**[_gently_] Frasier, these nice men are going to take your
             home.
    **Frasier:**[_in dazed confusion_] I'm - I'm, I'm doing my show! [_a guard
             takes the headphones off his ears_] I can't!  I'm on the air!
        **Roz:** No, you're not.  We cut you off.  You're on commercial.
      **Niles:** Don't you worry your little mucous-filled head about
             anything.  Everything's under control.
    
    _The guards have been slowly pushing Frasier out of the booth in his
    swivel chair._
    
    **Frasier:** But it's my show, it's my booth... [_exiting the door_]
             Hey, this is fun!  Ha!  Make it go faster!  Whee!
    _As they wheel him out, Roz quickly shuts the door and checks the clock._
        **Roz:**[_urgently_] Five seconds, Niles! 
    _She rushes into her booth.  Niles puts on the headphones and 
    Roz cues him by pointing._
    
      **Niles:** Hello!  This is Dr. Niles Crane again and no, we haven't
             taken leave of our senses.  That bit of inspired lunacy you
             heard just before the commercial was just a little docudrama 
             Frasier and I put together on the dangers of over-medication.
    
    _At this point, we see Frasier in the hallway behind the studio,
    running wildly away as the guards chase him off the screen.
    Concerned, Roz looks after him._ 
    
      **Niles:** Bravo, Frasier, for so brilliantly demonstrating why they call
             it "dope!"
    _FADE TO:
    
    Scene Four -- Frasier's Bedroom
    Frasier bolts awake, as he did earlier in the show, and starts yelling again. _
    
    **Frasier:**[_hysterically_] Daphne!  Daphne!
    
    _Daphne throws open the door again._
    
     **Daphne:** Whaaat?
    **Frasier:** I had another dream!  I dreamt I went down to the station all 
             doped-up and tried to take over my show and made a big fool 
             out of myself, and they-they dragged me out of there like a 
             lunatic in a butterfly net!
     **Daphne:**[_comfortingly_] Now, now, that was just a dream.  You 
             go back to sleep.  You'll feel better in the morning.
    _Soothed, he lays down again._
    **Frasier:** Oh, Daphne.  Can I have a little lemonade?  With fresh 
             lemons and maybe a little sprig of mint?
     **Daphne:**[_sweetly_] Anything you want.
    
    _Frasier falls back onto his bed, asleep.  Martin is waiting in the 
    doorway._
    
     **Martin:** Why'd you tell him it was a dream?
     **Daphne:** No fun telling him the truth now, when he's all doped up.  
             I'll wait till tomorrow morning - when he's good and lucid.
    
    _They laugh and exit.
    
    End Of Act Two (Time: 22:00)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    We see Frasier seated in his booth, talking very normally into
    the mike.  He looks over toward Roz's booth, smiling, and the 
    camera follows his gaze.  What we see seated there, on top of 
    the console, is not Roz... but Eddie with the headphones on! 
    
    Suddenly, we see Roz jerking awake, freaked out.  She looks 
    around her warily, then, relieved, she puts her headphones 
    back on. _
