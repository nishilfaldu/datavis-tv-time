    _Act One. 
    
    Scene One -- Cafe Nervosa
    The waitress is serving Frasier, it's his usual (or is it?)._
    
    **Waitress:** Here you go Doc, your usual.
     **Frasier:** My usual.  How lovely it is to have a usual. [_tastes it_]
              What is this?
    **Waitress:** Latte with nutmeg and cinnamon.
     **Frasier:** Ah, no, no, no, that's my brother's usual.  Mine is the
              double Kona with cream. 
       **Niles:**[_entering:_] Oh, Frasier, am I glad to see you.
    **Waitress:**[_to Niles:_] Your usual, Doc?
       **Niles:** Please. [_she hands Frasier's to Niles, then he carries on:_]
              Thank you!
     **Frasier:** Niles, you seem more than usually agitated today.  Problem?
       **Niles:** I'm meeting my publisher here in five minutes.  Remember the
              book deal I signed last month, the one you were so jealous
              of?
     **Frasier:** I wasn't jealous of it, Niles, you just wanted me to be
              jealous. 
       **Niles:** It's all moot anyway, the deal's about to be killed.  It
              turns out the idea I sold them had already been done.  They
              gave me until today to think up an alternative and I've got
              bupkes. I've got less than bupkes.  I've got what bupkes
              keeps for lint in the bottom of his pocket!
     **Frasier:** Can't you just ask for an extension?
       **Niles:** No, no, I've asked for two already. 
    
    [_He sees the publisher walking in._]
    
       **Niles:** Oh God there he is.  Sam, so good to see you.
         **Sam:** Niles.
       **Niles:** Sam Tanaka, my brother Dr. Frasier Crane.
     **Frasier:** My pleasure. [_the waitress brings Frasier's coffee_]
         **Sam:** Nice to meet you. 
       **Niles:** Sam, would you like a coffee?
         **Sam:**[_points to Frasier's cup:_] Oh, I'll have what he's having.
              [_Niles takes Frasier's cup and gives it to Sam._]
       **Niles:** So you shall.
     **Frasier:**[_to waitress:_] One more, please.
         **Sam:** Wait a second, you're the doctor from the radio, aren't
              you?
     **Frasier:** Guilty as charged.
         **Sam:** I listen to your show all the time.
     **Frasier:** Well, thank you.
         **Sam:** I never put it together that you two of you were brothers. 
       **Niles:** All our lives. [_laughs_]
         **Sam:** Well, you two must have incredible insight into sibling
              relationships. 
     **Frasier:** No more than your average psychiatrist brothers. [_laughs_] 
         **Sam:** So Niles, what's your idea? 
       **Niles:**[_nearly crying:_] My idea... Well Sam, you know I've given it
              a lot of thought, and it's not easy...
         **Sam:** You'd almost think there's a book in that.
       **Niles:** In what?
         **Sam:** Two psychiatrist brothers writing about sibling
              relationships. 
       **Niles:** That, Sam, is why you are the most respected publisher in
              the greater Seattle area.  That is exactly the idea we were
              going to pitch to you. 
     **Frasier:** What?  I hate to interrupt...
         **Sam:** Terrific!  Gentlemen, I'm going to cancel my lunch date so I
              can take you two out to celebrate.
       **Niles:** Well, we were going to write today, but OK. 
    
    [_Sam leaves._]
    
     **Frasier:** Niles, what the hell are you doing?  I don't want to write a
              book.  For God's sake, I'm out of here.
       **Niles:** Frasier, I know it's asking a big favor.  I mean, I know 
              you're busy.  But I want you to know that all of my life 
              I've dreamed of one thing: the day I could go into a 
              library and go to the card catalogue and see my name 
              under "mental illness" - the day I could finally feel 
              what you feel; that I'm somebody, not just one more 
              dusty little psychiatrist in a grey pinstripe suit.
     **Frasier:** Oh Niles, I...
       **Niles:** Come on!  We haven't collaborated on anything together since 
              we wrote the spring musical in prep school. 
     **Frasier:** Well, it was well received.  And it did get us out of gym 
              class. 
       **Niles:** It could be like that again.
     **Frasier:** I don't know, Niles...
    _Niles starts humming the tune from their old musical; Frasier starts
    bouncing in rhythm to it._
    _
       **Niles:** Ump-da, ump-da, ump-da, da-da-da, ump-da, ump-da, ump-da...
        **Both:**[_singing:_]
              Though some boys go to college,
              But we think they're all wussies,
              ï¿½Cause they get all the knowledge,
              And we get all the... 
              [_dancing in a circle_]
              Ump-da, ump-da, ump-da, da-da-da, ump-da, ump-da, ump-da...
     **Frasier:** Alright, I'll do it!
       **Niles:** Yes!
    _FADE OUT_
    **IT WAS PROBABLY
    LAKE SMITH**
    
    _Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    Later, Frasier answers the door to his partner, Niles. 
    Martin is by the television._
    
    **Frasier:** Dumas frere.
      **Niles:** Dumas frere.
     **Martin:** Hello Niles, what are you doing over here?
    **Frasier:** Oh Dad, I told you it's our first writing session tonight. 
     **Martin:** But I thought you were doing it over at Niles's house.
      **Niles:** Er, we were supposed to.  Unfortunately, it's Maris's turn to
             host her sherry tasting group and things tend to get a little 
             raucous when she does. 
     **Martin:** But "The Silencer"'s on in twenty minutes.
    **Frasier:** Dad, I've solved that problem.  
    _He produces a pair of wireless headphones, the type you can use to hear
    your television while the sound is muted._
    
    **Frasier:** I've bought you these headphones, see?  You'll be able to 
             listen to the TV, without disturbing Niles and me as we 
             work.
     **Martin:** What about Eddie?  How's he going to hear?
    **Frasier:** He can read about the game in tomorrow's paper.  Try 'em out,
             Dad.
    _Martin puts them on and listens while watching the TV._
     **Martin:**[_shouts:_] Hey, not bad! [_watches the TV_]
      **Niles:** Very clever solution.
    **Frasier:** Yes, and it also has another little feature that I like a
             lot.  Watch this. 
    _While Martin watches the TV, Frasier speaks out of his sight._
    **Frasier:** Hey, Dad!  Nice shirt.  Did they throw that in the last time 
             you had your tires rotated?
    _Martin doesn't respond, Frasier and Niles laugh._
      **Niles:** Hey Dad?  Tell us about the time you met Dwight Eisenhower.
             We haven't heard that story this hour! [_they laugh again_]
    **Frasier:** Okay, okay, my turn.  Hey, Dad?  Remember-
     **Martin:**[_obviously hearing:_] Say another word and I'll club you both
             with my cane. 
    _The brothers hastily back off and sit at the dinner table.  Martin
    settles down to watch the TV._
    
     **Martin:** This is great, thanks a lot. [_puts earphones around Eddie's 
             neck_] You better watch out for this for me, Eddie.  I'm going 
             to get myself a little snack.  Who wants some beer? 
    **Frasier:** Just you!  Alright now, Niles, this is no time to 
             procrastinate. 
      **Niles:**[_poised at the keyboard of his laptop_] OK, here we go.  
             Chapter One.  Page One.  Paragraph One.  I'm indenting!
    
    _Frasier shuts the laptop._
    
    **Frasier:** I hate to squash your enthusiasm, but don't you think before 
             We start actually typing the book, we should discuss what the
             book is going to be about!
      **Niles:** Forgive me for just barreling ahead, but damn it, I'm jazzed.
             You know we have to approach this book from a completely
             different angle from all of our previous writings, our
             dissertations, out theses...
    **Frasier:** Hmm, that's right.  Yeah, this has to be interesting!
      **Niles:** Well, the obvious approach is case histories.  We'll fill the
             book with anecdotes with brothers and sisters we've dealt
             with in our practice. 
    **Frasier:** Yes, and if we throw in a few references to heaving
             bosoms, we're bound to make Book of the Month Club.
     **Martin:** Why, I could tell you a couple of stories about you guys
             you could throw in there. 
      **Niles:** That's an idea, we could use ourselves, it would make a
             delicious introduction to our book.
    **Frasier:** I like the introduction idea.  Dad, OK, give us a story which
             depicts little Frasier and little Niles at their conflicted
             best. 
     **Martin:** Oh, that has to be when we went trout fishing up at that
             lake whats-its-name.  Boy, you guys were at it tooth and
             nail.
      **Niles:** This is good, this is interesting.
     **Martin:** Now, what was the name of that lake again.
    **Frasier:** Dad, the name of the lake is immaterial. 
     **Martin:** Indian word, Lake Whatchahatchi? 
    **Frasier:** Dad, you're missing the point here.
     **Martin:**[_ignoring:_] Oh, your mother would know.  Too bad she's dead!
             Er, whatacouchi, whatawoochi.  It was an Indian word, it meant
             "Land of a thousand..."  No!  This is driving me nuts!  I'm
             going to have to go in there and look it up.
    **Frasier:** Dad, we just wanted the story!
     **Martin:** No, it's alright.  Now where the hell did I put my atlas?
             [_leaves_]
    **Frasier:** Quite a resource, isn't he?
      **Niles:** Alright, we'll just put the introduction on hold. 
    **Frasier:** Okay, back to case histories.  Well, I suppose I could go take
             my files out of storage after the re... [_thinks of
             something_] Niles, is there a light bulb over my head?
      **Niles:** You have an idea?
    **Frasier:** No, [_sarcastically:_] I'm actually asking you if there's a
             light bulb over my head!  Of course I have an idea, it's my
             radio show.  I mean, what better source of case histories can
             there be?  I'll just ask my listeners to call in with their
             personal stories of sibling conflict, and you could be my
             guest on the show.
      **Niles:** So, what you're suggesting, is that exploit your listeners'
             lives for our own personal game?
    **Frasier:** In essence, yes.  What do you think?
      **Niles:** I think it's borderline sleazy.  Let's go for it! 
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE MOTHER LODE**
    
    _Scene Three - KACL
    So, on the next day, Frasier is standing in Roz's booth, setting up for 
    his show.  Niles is sitting to the side of his console, in front of the
    guest's mike.  Roz comes in and isn't too pleased._
    
    **Frasier:** Hello, Roz.
        **Roz:** Hey, Frasier.  What's your brother doing here?
    **Frasier:** He's going to be my guest on the show today.
        **Roz:** Oh, no!  I don't think so!  I am the producer, and I approve
             all the guests.  This wasn't run by me and I do not approve
             him!
    **Frasier:** OK, Roz, bye-bye, have a good show.
    
    _He puts down his script and starts to leave the booth._
    
        **Roz:** Okay, okay.  But I won't make him coffee, I won't run his 
             Errands and I'm not taking any of his crapola. [_through mike:_] 
             Hey, Niles, welcome aboard. [_to Frasier:_] Five seconds till 
             air.
    **Frasier:**[_into booth with Niles:_] OK, Niles, sit down, take a deep
             breath and try not to spit on the mike! [_on air:_]
             Hello Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  I have a very
             special guest with me today - my brother, the eminent
             psychiatrist, Dr. Niles Crane. 
      **Niles:** Hello, Emerald City!  What's doing, what's happenin'?
    **Frasier:**[_off air:_] What the hell do you think you're doing?
      **Niles:** That was my radio persona.  Every successful radio personality 
             has one. 
    **Frasier:** I don't.
      **Niles:** My point exactly. 
    **Frasier:** Just try to be yourself, will you? [_on air:_] Our topic today
             is siblings: what makes you love them, what makes you hate
             them...
      **Niles:** What little things do they do that especially annoy you?
             These could be things from your childhood OR they could
             things from your adolesence, OR they could be things from
             your young adulthood OR...
    **Frasier:** They could be things that are going on right now!  Roz,
             who's our first caller?
        **Roz:** We have Donald from Bainbridge Island.  He hasn't spoken to
             his brother for over twenty years. 
    **Frasier:** Hello, Donald.
      **Niles:** I'm listening! 
    **Frasier:** We're listening! 
    
    _Time Fade.
    The show is now nearing to a close.  A woman called Laura is on the
    line, talking to Frasier whilst Niles is scribbling down all the
    details._ 
    
      **Laura:**[_v.o._] I'll never forget it, Dr. Crane, I cried for two hours
             straight.
    **Frasier:** So, you were completely bald.
      **Laura:** Yes, the perm destroyed my hair.  I was sure my sisters were
             going to laugh at me.  But, they all kissed me and then they
             marched into the bathroom and shaved their heads too, just
             so I wouldn't feel like a freak. 
    
    _Frasier, Niles, and Roz share an amazed look over this story._
    
    **Frasier:** Amazing!  Well, there you have it, Seattle - the miracle of 
             the sibling relationship spelled out in an unselfish act of
             head-shaving.  Well, that's about all the time we have.  
             I'd like to thank my brother Dr. Niles Crane for being 
             here today.  Niles, I would shave my head for you.
      **Niles:** A gesture which becomes less significant with each passing
             year. [_Roz hides a grin_]
    **Frasier:** This is Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll be back tomorrow.  One Crane
             flying solo. 
    
    _He goes off the air._
    
      **Niles:** Frasier, we have hit the mother lode.  We've got enough
             information here for two volumes!  I must aplogise for 
             ever criticizing your radio program. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, it's all water under the pont-neuf. 
        **Roz:**[_peering round:_] I hate to break up the stroke-a-thon, but
             there's a Sam Tanaka on line one. 
    **Frasier:**[_presses button_] Oh, hello Sam, you're on speakerphone.
        **Sam:** I caught the show today, fellas.
    **Frasier:** You did!  And?
        **Sam:** Jackpot! [_Frasier and Niles make ecstatic faces at each other_] 
             How's the writing coming?
      **Niles:** Oh, incredible, it's just falling like water.  We've got, 
             what, two or three chapters already. 
        **Sam:** That's good to hear, because I just got off the phone with
             Reader's Digest.  They're interested in the serialization
             rights.  I need first few chapters to give them a taste, can
             you fax them right over?
    _Niles and Frasier share a look of panic._ 
    **Frasier:** Well, Sam Of course we could, but you know, they're a little
             rough, Sam.
        **Sam:** No problem, you've got till Friday to polish them up.  
             You can do that, right? 
    
    _Niles and Frasier look at each other in total dismay._
    
      **Niles:** Absolutely!
    **Frasier:** Friday's fine!
        **Sam:** Terrific, I love you guys! [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** My God, what are we going to do?
      **Niles:** Well now, let's remember we have all this material and now
             it's just a matter of putting it all together. 
    **Frasier:** It's due on Friday!
      **Niles:** We'll settle down and do it by [_stressed:_] Friday!
    **Frasier:** Wait, wait, I just remembered a story about George and Ira
             Gershwin when they had to meet a deadline.  They would lock
             themselves in a hotel room, free from distractions, and not
             come out until their task was complete. 
      **Niles:** Brilliant!  If we get hot we'll not only finish this volume
             but we can write another chorus to "Betsy Who Is My Woman
             Now." 
    
    _End of Act One (Time: 11:52)
    
    Act Two._
    
    **GEORGE AND IRA**
    
    _Scene One -- Hotel Room
    The Crane boys arrive at their hotel room.  It's time to get to work.
    _
      **Niles:** It's clean, it's sparkling, [_re: paintings on walls_] it's 
             mass-produced art, it's totally devoid of charm - it's 
             perfect.  Let's get to work.
    **Frasier:** I'm with you, mon frere.  We cannot be intimidated by the 
             tyranny of a blank page.  All we need to get a good start 
             here is... Room Service!
      **Niles:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Niles, you're right!  All we need is a good opening sentence.
             Something that will smack the reader right between the eyes
             and then take him on a virtual roller-coaster ride of self
             awareness and discovery.
      **Niles:**[_typing_] Frasier, while you were out there mixing metaphors 
             like a Cuisinart, I've had a breakthrough.  Voila!  Our 
             opening sentence!
    **Frasier:**[_reading:_] "From Romulus and Remus to the Le Nain Sisters,
             sibling relationships have sparked psychological debate
             throughout the world." [_thinks_] Interesting.
      **Niles:** You like it?
    **Frasier:** Well, I said it was interesting.  The task ahead of us now is 
             to decide whether we'd like an interesting opening or a good
             one. 
      **Niles:** You're just being negative because you didn't think of it
             first.
    **Frasier:** No!  In truth I'm not.  I never cared for Romulus, I never
             cared for Remus and the reference to the Le Nain Sisters is
             from the friggin' moon. 
      **Niles:** Well, alright, if you can do better, please be my guest. 
    **Frasier:** I will.
    _Ten-second pause._
    **Niles:** My fingers are poised over the keys... I'm waiting.
    _Some time later, Frasier and Niles have taken off their jackets,
    they are sitting in the same exact spot and Niles is still twiddling 
    his thumbs above the keyboard.  They look more tired._
    
      **Niles:** I'm still waiting!
    **Frasier:** Alright, alright, put this down!  "The key to a good sibling
             relationship is the ability to be open and honest."
      **Niles:** That actually sounded good to me.
    **Frasier:** Well, put that in there.
      **Niles:**[_typing:_] "The key to a good sibling relationship is the
             ability to be open and honest, while still respecting each
             other's boundaries."
    **Frasier:** What are you doing?  What was that crap about boundaries?
      **Niles:** I was just finishing the thought. 
    **Frasier:** The thought was finished.  It didn't need finishing, for God's
             sake.  Now it's a run-on sentence. 
      **Niles:** I think it's much better this way. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I don't!
      **Niles:** Well, I'm at the keyboard.
    **Frasier:** Alright then, let me type! 
    
    _Niles holds onto the keyboard, whilst Frasier tugs it._
    
      **Niles:** No, I can only write at the keyboard. 
    **Frasier:** Niles, you haven't written a thing all day, except to ruin a
             perfectly good opening sentence. 
      **Niles:**[_mad:_] I was merely finishing it, it was an incomplete
             thought.
    **Frasier:** You're an incomplete thought!  What happened to the iced tea?
      **Niles:** I finished that too! 
    _Much later, both men are stripped down to their undershirts (Niles,
    of course, wears suspenders).  Frasier is lying on the bed, guzzling
    drinks from the mini bar.  Niles is barely awake over the keys, 
    yawning._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, I've just had an epiphany.
      **Niles:** Oh wonderful, we could use a second sentence.
    **Frasier:** No, it's not for the book.  I've just realised why so many
             writers become bloated alcoholic suicides. [_Niles types_]
             No, don't type that in.
      **Niles:** I'm not, I'm adding up our tab from the mini-bar.  We now
             owe... two hundred thirty-two dollars.
    **Frasier:**[_looks out of window._] Oh, Dear God!
      **Niles:** Well, you're the damn fool that ate the whole jar of
             Macadamia nuts! 
    **Frasier:** No, it's dawn.  It's Friday!  Oh Niles, why don't we just
             admit it.  We can't work together, there's never going to 
             be any book! 
      **Niles:**[_brushing up hair:_] Not with that attitude, there isn't.
    **Frasier:** Oh, will you get off it!  Come on, the fat lady has sung!  The
             curtain has been run down here.  I'll type it for you in
             capital letters! [_he does_]
      **Niles:**[_reading:_] "IT'S UVER?"
    **Frasier:** Let's just go home.
    _Frasier gets up and goes to the door, while Niles picks up a bottle
    that came from the mini-bar._
      **Niles:** Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd give up so 
             easily.  It's not your dream, after all.  Why should it be, 
             Mr. Bigshot Radio Host?
    **Frasier:** Oh, so that's what this little tantrum is all about, huh?
             You're jealous of my celebrity?
      **Niles:** It's not a tantrum, and I'm not jealous.  I'm just [_angry:_]
             FED UP!  I'm fed up with being second all the time.  You know,
             I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom way before you did,
             but because you were older you got there first.  You were
             first to get married.  You were first to give Dad the
             grandchild he always wanted.  By the time I get around 
             to doing anything, it's all chewed meat! 
    **Frasier:** You're crying about something that we can't change!
      **Niles:** Oh, you wouldn't change it if you could, you love it!
    **Frasier:** Oh, let it go, Niles!
      **Niles:** I can't let it go!  My nose is rubbed in it every day!  
             _I'm_ the one on the board of the Psychiatric Association, 
             _my_ research is well respected in academic circles, 
             four of _my_ patients have been elected to political office, 
             but it's _your_ big fat face they put on the side of buses!
    **Frasier:** I do not have a fat face!
      **Niles:** Oh please, I've been wondering how long you're going to
             store those nuts for winter!
    **Frasier:** Well, at least I'm not SPINDLY!
      **Niles:** Who you calling spindly, Fat Face?
    **Frasier:** You, Spindly.
      **Niles:** Fat Face!
    **Frasier:** Spindly!
      **Niles:** Fat Face!
    **Frasier:** Spindly!
      **Niles:** Fat Face!
    **Frasier:** You take that back!
      **Niles:** You make me.
    **Frasier:** I will make you.
      **Niles:** I don't see you making me.
    **Frasier:** Well, here's making you...
    
    _Frasier reaches forward and pulls a hair out of Niles's chest._ 
    
      **Niles:** OW!
    _Frasier turns toward the door.  Niles runs after him and jumps 
    on his back. 
    
    Growling, Frasier spins around and slams Niles against the wall, 
    twice.  Losing his wind, Niles drops off Frasier's back, and 
    they grapple with their arms._
      **Niles:**[_levering Frasier's chin_] Here's your fat face!  Gimme that-
    **Frasier:** Gimme that-
    _As they wrestle, Niles gets the upper hand by placing Frasier 
    in a headlock.  He laughs triumphantly._
    **Frasier:** Niles!  Niles!  Stop it!  We're psychiatrists, not pugilists! 
    
    _Niles, looking stunned, releases him._
    
    **Frasier:** I can't believe you fell for that! [_seizes Niles in a headlock_]
    _Niles tries to break free, Frasier throws him onto the bed, then leaps
    onto him with a yell.  He starts to throttle Niles._
    
      **Niles:** My God, my God, I'm having a flashback: you're climbing in
             my crib and jumping on me!
    **Frasier:** YOU STOLE MY MOMMY!
    _Suddenly realizing his insanity, Frasier stops and gets off the bed._ 
    **Frasier:** Oh my God, oh my God.  Niles, I've gotta get out of here.  
             This entire idea has been a fiasco since the start.  It's 
             the stupidest idea you ever had, I should never have agreed 
             to it!  Goodbye!
    _He grabs his briefcase and exits without bothering to get dressed.
    As he slams the door behind him, Niles, whipped, tumbles off the bed
    onto the floor.
    
    FADE TO:
    
    Scene Two -- Frasier's Apartment
    The next morning, Frasier enters the main room of his apartment
    where Martin and Daphne are sitting._
    
    **Frasier:** Morning, all.
     **Martin:** Morning.
     **Daphne:** You seem cheerful this morning, Dr. Crane.
    **Frasier:** Why shouldn't I be?
     **Martin:** Well, it's going to rain again, jobless rate's up, [_Frasier 
             bites into a muffin_] and about two minutes ago Eddie was 
             licking that muffin. 
    _Frasier puts the muffin down and washes out his mouth, the door bell goes._
     **Daphne:** Oh, I'll get it. 
    **Frasier:** Dad, the mark of a pure man is that one that realizes he can't
             control his circumstances, he can only control his response. 
     **Martin:** Have you talked to your brother yet?
    **Frasier:**[_going to kitchen_] I do not have a brother!  I'm an only 
             child!
     **Daphne:**[_answering door to Niles_] Oh, hello Dr. Crane.
      **Niles:** Hello Daphne, [_walks in_] Dad.
    _Frasier comes out of the kitchen and sees Niles._
    **Frasier:** What are you doing here?
      **Niles:**[_to Martin:_] Dad, I would like you to convey a message from
             me to Frasier. 
     **Martin:** What makes you think I know where he is?
      **Niles:** Tell him, he owes me half this hotel bill.  Tell him I'll
             accept cash but no personal checks, as I know he has trouble
             writing things! 
    
    _Martin hands the bill to Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** I'm not paying any of this!
      **Niles:** So, you're cheap as well as intellectually barren. 
    **Frasier:** And you're a no-talent hack.
      **Niles:** And you look stupid in a t-shirt! 
     **Martin:** Alright, that's enough.  Sit down and listen to me.  Sit down. 
             [_they do._] I never had a brother, but I had a partner once, 
             my first, Mitch Gussy.  Big bear of a guy, arms like tree-
             trunks.  Mitch and I would go to ball games together, we'd 
             play cards, and this was after work with eight hours 
             together...
    **Frasier:** Dad, that's all very nice...
     **Martin:** Just listen to me.  Three months into our partnership, Gus and 
             I got assigned to a stakeout.  Three days in the front seat of 
             a Chevy Nova together.  Sitting up, drinking too much coffee. 
             It didn't take long before we started getting on each other's 
             nerves. 
      **Niles:** Because he was a big, egotistical fat-face?
     **Martin:** Because we were human.  He didn't like this about me, I didn't 
             like that about him, so it got ugly.  When the stakeout was 
             over Gus requested a transfer and that was fine by me.  Three 
             months later, he was stabbed after breaking up a bar fight.  
             By the time I got to the hospital, it was too late.  
    _Beat._
     **Martin:** Take what you want from this story, guys.  All I know is,
             it ain't worth it. 
     **Daphne:**[_runs to the kitchen, crying:_] Excuse me, I need a hanky. 
     **Martin:** Isn't there something you'd like to say to your brother?
    **Frasier:** Yes Dad, I suppose there is. [_holding the muffin Eddie 
             licked:_] Niles, would you like a muffin?
     **Martin:** Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Alright!  Niles, sorry things didn't work out with the book.
             You have no reason to feel inferior to me.  You're an
             accomplished psychiatrist, a decent man, and you stand 
             second to no-one. 
      **Niles:** Thank you Frasier.  The truth is, I've always looked up to you
             and admired you. 
     **Martin:** Alright, enough of this mushy girly stuff.  Just shake hands,
             punch each other on the shoulder and be done with it. 
    **Frasier:** Oh, what the heck! 
    
    _Niles and Frasier hug, which just disappoints Martin.  Martin walks
    into the kitchen for a Ballantine and finds Daphne crying._
    
     **Martin:** What are you crying about?
     **Daphne:** I just keep thinking about poor Gus, it must be so hard on
             you carrying all that pain around.
     **Martin:** There was no Gus, I just made him up.
     **Daphne:** What?!
     **Martin:** Well, at least there's one good writer in this family. 
    
    _Daphne hits Martin with a cloth, after feeling used._
    
    _End of Act Two. (Time: 22:10)_
    
    **Credits:**
    
    That night, in the kitchen, there are some muffins on a plate. 
    Eddie jumps up onto the side, knocks the muffin on to the floor 
    and jumps down so he can have his feast.
