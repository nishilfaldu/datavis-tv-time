    _Act One
    
    Scene A: KACL Radio Station. 
    Frasier is doing his show._
     
    **Frasier:**[_on-air_] Just remember Angela, cosmetic surgery is only a
             superficial solution.  You can lift your eyelids, but it can't
             lift that little cloud of pessimism that hovers over you.  
             Thank you for your call.  So okay Roz, who's our next caller? 
    
    _He looks over to find that Roz's booth is empty._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Roz?  Perhaps this would be a good time to go to commercial 
             break.  We'll be right back after these messages. 
    _He goes off the air and walks into Roz's booth, looks into the 
    corridor, spots Roz coming back and hides behind the door.  
    
    Roz comes running in, sits down and realizes Frasier's not where he's 
    supposed to be._
    
        **Roz:** Frasier? [_he tilts her seat back so she can see him_] Whoa!  
             Hi.
    **Frasier:** A little disturbing, looking in the booth and seeing no one 
             there, isn't it?
        **Roz:** I'm sorry, but I was up in the newsroom, trying to find out if
             they've announced the nominations for the SeaBeas yet.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I forgot.  Are those coming out today?
        **Roz:** You forgot?  They're only the biggest award in Seattle radio!
    **Frasier:** Well, I suppose it's the difference in our ages, but I don't
             find myself getting excited about... well, much of anything
             anymore.
    
    _Noel Shempsky enters._
    
       **Noel:** Congratulations, guys.
    **Frasier:** YES!!!  Yes, we got a nomination!
        **Roz:** Who did you hear it from?
       **Noel:** Oh, I haven't heard anything, I was just congratulating you on
             doing a great show.  If anyone deserves a nomination, you guys
             do.
    
    _Long Pause._
    
    **Frasier:**[_growling_] Get out, Noel.
       **Noel:** Okay, catch you later. [_exits_]
    **Frasier:** Well I... I guess I'm a little more excited than I let on.  
             Well, it'll be a big feather in my cap to win this, first 
             year in radio and all that? [_goes into recording booth_]
        **Roz:** Are you kidding?  I've been in this business for ten years, 
             I've never produced a show that got nominated for anything. 
             [_phone rings, she answers_] Hello?  Oh hi, Millie.  You're 
             kidding.  You're kidding! [_Frasier comes racing back_] Oh, 
             you're kidding, that's great!  Thanks, bye. [_puts phone down_]
    **Frasier:** We got the nomination!
        **Roz:** No, Millie in Promotions is getting married!
    **Frasier:** DAMN IT, ROZ!
    _FADE OUT
    
    Scene B: Cafe Nervosa. 
    Frasier and Niles are having coffee._
    
      **Niles:** And then she said she'd been seeing someone else.  She 
             couldn't keep living a lie.  I was dumbfounded.  I mean, 
             what about everything we'd gone through together, didn't 
             that mean anything to her?
    **Frasier:** Niles, a patient has a right to change therapists.
    
    _Bebe Glaser, Frasier's unscrupulous agent, walks in._
    
       **Bebe:** Frasier!  Thank God.
    **Frasier:** Bebe, what are you doing here?
       **Bebe:** What kind of agent would I be if I weren't the first to tell
             you that you've been nominated for a 1994 SeaBea!
    **Frasier:**[_jumps up_] I WAS NOMINATED!  I WAS NOMINATED! 
    _He notices everyone in the room is looking at him, so he sits down._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Well, I was.
       **Bebe:** Yes.  You, Frasier Crane M.D., PhD, S-T-U-D, are the man of 
             the hour. [_notices Niles_] Bebe Glaser, Frasier's agent.
      **Niles:** Dr. Niles Crane, Frasier's brother.
       **Bebe:** You're not a psychiatrist too?
      **Niles:** Yes.
       **Bebe:** Oh, please!  If I'm ever to have a breakdown, let me have it 
             now! [_to Niles_] Double-double decaf, to go.
    **Frasier:** So, this, ah, this is quite a surprise, you know.  Actually 
             I'd, ah, forgotten that the nominations were coming out today.
       **Bebe:** Oh, isn't he precious?  You must be very proud of Frasier.
      **Niles:** Well actually... no.  This nomination is just one more 
             signpost on the low road of celebrity which my brother has 
             chosen for himself.
    **Frasier:** Well, that's not sibling rivalry rearing its vicious little 
             green snout?
      **Niles:** Absolutely not.  I'm still in the minority who still believes
             that psychiatry is a noble profession that is tarnished by 
             such things as popularity contests, not to mention a bouncy 
             little radio program.
       **Bebe:** I bet you two had wicked little hair-pulling fights when you 
             were tots.
    
    _Both Niles and Frasier touch their hair._
    
      **Niles:** Yes, well.  This has been delightful, but I really must run. 
             I'm due at my sexual addiction group, and I don't like to 
             leave them alone for too long. [_he leaves as Roz enters_]
        **Roz:** Frasier?
    **Frasier:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Frasier, Frasier, Frasier!
    **Frasier:** Roz, Roz, Roz! [_they hug and do a little dance_]
        **Roz:** We did it!
    **Frasier:** I know!  Come and sit down.  You know, I've never really 
             won anything before.  Although back in prep school, the 
             Existentialist Club once named me "Most Likely To Be."
        **Roz:** You want to hear the greatest part?  I've already got a date 
             for the ceremony - Brad MacNamara.
    **Frasier:** The Channel Eight reporter?  "Television's Most Handsome Man."
        **Roz:** Yes.  You know, for months he wouldn't give me the time of 
             day, but one nomination and he knew who I was.
       **Bebe:** Who are you?
        **Roz:** I'm Roz Doyle.  Frasier's producer.
       **Bebe:** Oh, yes that's right, I've seen you bring him coffee.  By the
             way, would you mind getting mine?
    **Frasier:** I'd better get myself on the ball here, I've got a lot to do.
       **Bebe:** Oh, not really, darling.  I've already got your tux, rented 
             you a limo and your tickets will be waiting for you at the 
             door.
    **Frasier:** Well... seems the only thing you haven't taken care of is 
             finding me a date.
       **Bebe:** Your subtlety floors me, I'd love to.  I am thrilled, thrilled, 
             thrilled for you both.  I've got to run.  Two of my other 
             clients weren't nominated and I have to tell them what a 
             worthless award this is.
    _FADE TO:_
    **ROZ AND FRASIER
    HATCH A MERRY PLAN**
    
    _Scene C: Frasier's Apartment. 
    He is opening a bottle of champagne.  Martin and Daphne are watching._
    **Frasier:** Daphne, you may not be aware of this, but there is a special
             secret to opening a bottle of champagne, especially a fine 
             French champagne as unprepossessing as this one -- two hundred 
             dollars a bottle.  In order to prevent spillage, one does not 
             simply twist out the cork.  Instead, one holds the cork 
             stationary, you see, and then gives the bottle three easy 
             turns.  One... 
    
    _The cork flies out with a loud POP, champagne gushes everywhere._ 
    
    **Frasier:** OH, GOD!  Oh no, get some glasses! 
    _Eddie starts licking the spillage from the table.  Frasier shoos him 
    away._
    **Frasier:** Eddie, get away from there, you mangy little cur!  Oh, Lord.  
             Oh well, that wasn't too bad, I believe we've salvaged most 
             of it.
     **Martin:** I'd say this calls for a toast.  To my number one son.  
             Congratulations on your first nomination for... well, 
             anything.  Frasier, I'm proud of you.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, dad.  Means a lot to me.
    
    _Martin exits to the kitchen as Daphne sips her champagne._
    
     **Daphne:** Mmm.  Oh, this champagne is delicious.
    **Frasier:** Mmm.  It's quite exquisite, isn't it?  Dad, what do you think?
    
    _Martin returns from the kitchen with a beer, which he pours into his
    champagne glass._
    
     **Martin:** I was in the mood for something domestic.
     **Daphne:** You know, I must say, Dr. Crane, it's awfully nice that, 
             although I'm an employee here, you include me in all the 
             family celebrations.
    **Frasier:** Well Daphne, there's never been any doubt that I, I think of
             you as my equal in every way.
    _The doorbell rings. Frasier sits down while Daphne sips her champagne. 
    When it rings again, Frasier glares at her until she moves._
    
     **Daphne:**[_sarcastically_] Oh, I'll get it.
    **Frasier:** Oh, would you?
     **Daphne:** Would you like me to announce your visitor?
    **Frasier:** Oh, just answer the door!
     **Daphne:**[_answering door_] Oh, hello Roz.
        **Roz:**[_entering_] Daphne.
     **Martin:** Roz!
        **Roz:** Hey.
     **Daphne:** Congratulations.
        **Roz:** Oh, thanks.  You know, I couldn't believe it myself.  Brad 
             MacNamara!
    **Frasier:** Roz, I believe she was referring to your SeaBea nomination?
     **Daphne:** No, I meant Brad MacNamara.  Oh, do you think he wears any 
             pants under that desk?
        **Roz:** Not on my TV.
    _They laugh like schoolgirls, complete with catcalls and air-pumping._
    **Frasier:** Girls, can we just cut out the pajama party, please?
        **Roz:**[_to Martin_] Hello, Mr. C.
     **Martin:**[_taps his cheek_] Hey Roz, how's my girlfriend?
        **Roz:** Well, [_gives him a kiss_] she's nominated.
     **Daphne:** How about a glass of champagne?  Apparently it's French and
             unprepossessing.
    **Frasier:** Oh Daphne, save your breath.  It could come out of a box and 
             Roz would have a glass of it.
     **Daphne:** You know, I must say, I am so proud of you, Roz, being 
             recognized in a male-dominated industry.  It's one more 
             step forward for working women.  You're a credit to our 
             gender.
        **Roz:** Well, thank you Daphne.  Oh, that reminds me, do you have a 
             push-up bra I could borrow?
     **Daphne:** I'll go and look. [_exits_]
        **Roz:** Thanks. [_to Frasier_] I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I 
             had to show you this, Frasier. [_retrieves a piece of newspaper 
             from her bag_] I've got a friend over at "Broadcast Magazine"
             who sent me a copy.  It's a full-page ad.
    **Frasier:**[_reading_] "Wendy Ashiro wishes to thank the members of the 
             voting committee for her nomination, and hopes they consider 
             her for the award."  This is nothing but shameless self- 
             promotion.  It's in very bad taste.
        **Roz:** I know.  What are we gonna put in our ad?
     **Martin:** Wendy Ashiro's up against you for this award?  Oh, I like her,
             she's a cutie.
    **Frasier:** You're not suggesting we put our own ad in this thing?
        **Roz:** Frasier, we're falling behind.  Mike Sanchez has already sent
             out tapes of his show.
     **Martin:** Mike Sanchez?  Oh, I like him.
        **Roz:** And who knows what Fletcher Grey's doing?
     **Martin:** Fletcher Grey?
    **Frasier:** THANK YOU, DAD! [_to Roz, about the ad_] Well, all right, I--
             just as long as it's tasteful and understated.
        **Roz:** Great.  I'll call my friend, and have him work something up 
             for us.
    **Frasier:** No, wait a minute, wait a minute, we really want to stand out,
             why run another boring old ad?  We should do something 
             different, something unique.
        **Roz:** Hey, I heard last year's winner threw a big cocktail party.
    **Frasier:** Okay, okay, we could do that, but we should do something else,
             something to keep our names in their minds.  You know what I 
             mean?  Uh, I know.  Personalized gifts, uh, from oh, the new 
             Tiffany's catalogue. [_picks it up_]
        **Roz:** That's good.  That's it.
    **Frasier:** I saw the most incredible cigarette cases in here.
        **Roz:** No, no.  No cigarette cases, it sends out a bad message.
    **Frasier:** Oh, yeah.
        **Roz:** Ooh, how about a silver flask?
    **Frasier:** No, we've already got your vote, Roz.
     **Martin:** Hold on a minute.  Look, I may not know anything about show-
             business, but when you start sending out gifts to people who
             can do something for you, that's called bribery.
    **Frasier:** It's a simple "Thank you" for a nomination.
     **Martin:** Well, I'm glad to hear that. [_takes catalogue_] Because if I 
             had to give somebody a gift to get an award, it's not worth 
             having.  Might as well just go on down to the trophy store 
             and buy one yourself. [_throws catalogue on fire, then exits_]
    
    _Frasier and Roz sit down dejectedly. Silence for a moment, then-_
    
        **Roz:** I really want that award.
    **Frasier:** Me too!
        **Roz:** Get that catalogue!
    
    _They both make a dash for the fireplace._
    
    _End of Act One._
     
    _Act Two._
    **THE PLOT THICKENS**
    _Scene A: The Seattle Broadcast Awards.
    A black tie affair.  Martin and Frasier are standing by the door._
    
       **Martin:** Well, you coming in or not?
      **Frasier:** Dad, this is a big moment for me.  I want to drink it in.
       **Martin:** Me, too.  Where's the bar?
    
    _They enter, followed by a hobbling Daphne._
    
       **Daphne:** Hey, not so fast.  Me shoes are killing me.  I hate these 
               shoes, I should never have let that salesgirl talk me into 
               getting them.
       **Martin:** They look real good on you, though.
       **Daphne:**[_brightening up_] You think so?
    
    _A man calls Frasier over._
    
     **Peterson:** Dr. Crane?  Bob Peterson, voting committee. [_they shake 
               hands_]
      **Frasier:** Hi, Bob.
     **Peterson:** Look, I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.
      **Frasier:** Thank you, thank you.
     **Peterson:** Oh, and uh, thanks for the bathrobe.
      **Frasier:** Oh, it's nothing.  People get out of the shower, they're 
               cold.
    
    _A woman comes over as Peterson leaves._
    
        **Woman:** Dr. Crane.  Love the watch. [_indicates her wristwatch_]
      **Frasier:** It's nothing, really.  It's a pretty good likeness of me 
               though, isn't it?
       **Daphne:** Can we please sit down?  I have got to sit down. [_she sits 
               at the nearest table_]
      **Frasier:** Daphne, we're at table eight.  This isn't our table.
       **Daphne:**[_ripping up the card with the table number on it_] It is now.
       **Martin:**[_indicating distinguished man_] Hey, isn't that Fletcher 
               Grey?
      **Frasier:** Oh yes, I believe it is.
       **Martin:** Oh boy, you really got your work cut out for you here.  Let 
               me tell you, that guy's a class act.  I been listening to 
               him for twenty years.  You know, I don't usually do this, 
               but I'm going over to shake his hand. [_leaves table as Roz 
               enters_]
          **Roz:** Hey, guys.
      **Frasier:** Oh, Roz.  There's my fellow nominee.
          **Roz:** Frasier, those gifts were such a great idea.  Everybody's 
               talking about them.
      **Frasier:** I know.  Did you see the valet parking board? Half the key 
               chains there are ours!
          **Roz:** Look, Frasier, this is a very big night for me, so please, 
               PLEASE don't spoil it by making fun of who I brought.
      **Frasier:** I thought you were bringing Brad MacNamara?
          **Roz:** Well I was, but he got called out on a story at the last 
               minute.  Some hospital went up in flames.  Do you know 
               anyone who has worse luck than I do?
    
    _Roz's date enters.  It's Noel._
    
         **Noel:** Hi, Dr. Crane. [_gives Vulcan peace salute_]
      **Frasier:** Oh, hi Noel. [_to Roz, quietly_] Noel Shempsky's your date?
          **Roz:** Mmm-hmm.
         **Noel:**[_arrives at table and puts his arm around Roz_] A tip, Dr. 
               Crane?  If you're ever nominated again, there's a metered 
               parking block three blocks away.  They don't check after 
               six! [_to Roz_] Oh, here are the car keys so you can drive us 
               home. [_to Frasier_] I have night blindness. [_goes to table_]
          **Roz:** I wish I did.
         **Noel:**[_sits next to Daphne_] Hi.  I'm Noel.
       **Daphne:** Nice to meet you.  Can you rub my feet?
      **Frasier:** Daphne!
    
    _Niles arrives._
    
        **Niles:** Good evening, everybody.
      **Frasier:** Oh, hi Niles.  Listen, thank you so much for coming.  I know 
               how you feel about this award, and about coming downtown 
               after 
               dark.
        **Niles:** Don't be silly.  You're my brother and I wouldn't miss a 
               gala affair like this.  Hello, Daphne.
       **Daphne:** Can you rub my feet?
        **Niles:** Yes.
      **Frasier:**[_stopping him_] Niles.  So, where's Maris?
        **Niles:** Well, we were just getting ready to leave the house, when 
               Maris got a glimpse of herself in the hall mirror...
      **Frasier:** Niles, at the end of this story, will I roll my eyes?
        **Niles:** I did.
      **Frasier:** Well then, just skip it.  Listen, get me a scotch, will you?
       **Martin:**[_returning_] That Fletcher Grey, he's aces.  Would you 
               believe he remembered me from 1968?
      **Frasier:** No!
       **Martin:** Yeah, I was working on a murder case he was covering.  He 
               just looked at me and said, "Hey, you're the guy who found 
               the head."  He's been nominated for this award eleven times 
               and he's never won it.
      **Frasier:** Really?  Jeez, I didn't know that.
       **Daphne:** Well, I'm afraid he's just going to have to lose again, 
               right Dr. Crane?
       **Martin:** Well, if he does you can always cheer him up by sending him
               something nice from your little gift shop.
    
    _Fletcher Grey comes over to the table._
    
     **Fletcher:** Dr. Crane?
      **Frasier:** Fletcher Grey!
     **Fletcher:** Been meaning to come over and wish you luck.  Even though I 
               don't think you need it.
      **Frasier:** Well, that's very kind.  I, I hardly think I have a chance 
               against you tonight.
     **Fletcher:** Well you know, I hope you're right?  I'd really love to win 
               it this time.  Eleven losses in a row, it's starting to get 
               a little embarrassing.
      **Frasier:** Oh, don't be silly.  You'd have to lose fifteen, sixteen 
               times before you'd feel the least bit ashamed.
     **Fletcher:** Would you believe I even considered campaigning for it this 
               year?  You know, sending out gifts, throwing one on those 
               parties.  Bet you'd have something to say on your radio 
               program about someone who's THAT self-absorbed.
       **Martin:** I bet he could do a whole hour on it.
    
    _Fletcher's Mom comes over._
    
    **Mrs. Grey:** Fletcher dear, they're starting to serve the salads.
     **Fletcher:** Oh, Mom. [_to Frasier_] I'm sixty years old, and I'm still her 
               little boy. 
               Dr. Crane, I'd like you to meet my mother, Hannah.
      **Frasier:** What a pleasure, Hannah.  Nice to meet you.
     **Fletcher:** Mom just flew in from Scottsdale.  This is her eleventh 
               year.
    **Mrs. Grey:** I hope he wins it this time.  It's getting harder and harder 
               to get on that plane.
     **Fletcher:** Mom, why don't you go back to the table before your legs 
               swell up?  I'll get you another Pink Lady.  No, no mom, over 
               there.
    
    _They go back to their table as Bebe arrives._
    
         **Bebe:** Sorry I've been detained, dear.
      **Frasier:** Oh hi, Bebe.
         **Bebe:** Civilization will not advance one iota until they start 
               putting more toilets in the ladies room.
    
    _Niles returns with Frasier's scotch._
    
      **Frasier:** Oh, thank you Niles.
         **Bebe:**[_to Niles_] Some champagne.
         **Noel:** Ah, a diet root beer?
    
    _Niles leaves to get the drinks._
    
         **Bebe:** I have to tell you that the buzz in line was that all those
               lovely gifts you've been sending have really paid off.  It 
               looks like you're in a neck-and-neck race with Fletcher 
               Grey, that wrinkled old war... [_notices Martin_] ...rt.  
               Hello, Mr. Crane.  You're even more handsome than the last 
               time I saw you.  If I were twenty years older they couldn't 
               keep me away from you.
       **Martin:** That's why I keep this cane.
    _The ceremony begins as Keith Bishop, the emcee, takes the podium._
    
        **Keith:** Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Would everybody please 
               take their seats?  I'm Keith Bishop, and I'd like to welcome 
               you to the fifteenth annual SeaBea awards.  Assisting me 
               tonight in handing out the awards is Miss SeaBea 1994, Tawny 
               Van Deusen.
    
    _As the Emcee carries on with the ceremony, Frasier talks to Roz._
    
      **Frasier:** Listen Roz, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about all the
               campaigning we did.  Did you know Fletcher Grey has been 
               nominated eleven times and never won?  He didn't lift a 
               finger to win this thing.
          **Roz:** Frasier, don't worry about him.  Besides, he can win it next
               year.
        **Keith:** Before we start this evening's program, I'd like to take 
               this moment to make a very sad announcement.  I just found 
               out moments ago that the dean of Seattle radio, my mentor 
               Fletcher Grey, will be retiring this year.
          **All:** Awww...
        **Keith:** Take a bow, Fletcher. 
    
    _Fletcher does so, to the applause of the audience._
    
        **Keith:** Well, we're gonna start things off with a bang.  The award 
               for "Outstanding Achievement For Informational Programming 
               in Radio..."
          **Roz:** That's us, that's us!
        **Keith:** Whoops.  Can't see a thing without my glasses.
      **Frasier:** You know, Fletcher Grey really deserves this award.  If we 
               win, can't we just not accept it?
          **Roz:**[_grabbing him by the shirt_] Listen, Frasier!  I have waited 
               ten years to get this award and if I have to crawl over 
               Fletcher Grey's mother to get it, I'll DO IT!
      **Frasier:** Roz, I... I've never seen you like this before.
          **Roz:** It isn't pretty, is it?
        **Keith:** The nominations: "Community Forum," Wendy Ashiro, talent, 
               Mike Freedman, producer.
    
    _Light applause._
    
        **Keith:** "Consumer Update," Mike Sanchez, talent, T.J. "Chester" 
               Nuevo, producer.
    
    _More light applause._
    
        **Keith:** "The Frasier Crane Show," Dr. Frasier Crane, talent, Roz 
               Doyle, producer.
    
    _Still more light applause._
    
        **Keith:** "Fletcher Grey: From Where I Sit," Fletcher Grey, talent, 
               Fletcher Grey, producer.
    
    _There is a huge round of applause._] 
    
        **Keith:** And the envelope, please?
      **Frasier:** If we win this thing, they're gonna lynch us!
          **Roz:** So what?  At least everyone will see my dress.
        **Keith:** Well... this is a first.  It seems we have a tie.
      **Frasier:** Good.  We can share it with Fletcher.
          **Roz:** I don't want to share it!  I'm already sharing it with you!
        **Keith:** And the winners are... Wendy Ashiro and Mike Sanchez!
      **Frasier:** What?? 
          **Roz:** What!!
    **Mrs. Grey:** What?
    _FADE TO:_
    **THE THRILLING DENOUEMENT**
    
    _Scene B: Time Lapse.
    The staff are cleaning up.  Roz and Frasier are still drowning 
    their sorrows._
    
      **Martin:** Well, the party's over.  Are you coming home?
     **Frasier:** No, dad.
      **Martin:** Then I'll guess we'll just go on without you. 
     **Frasier:** Fine with me.
      **Martin:** Listen, Frasier.  I don't agree with the way you went about 
              it, but I'm still sorry that you lost.  It's never easy to 
              lose.
     **Frasier:** Thanks, dad.
      **Martin:** Of course, if you were to have joined some organized sports 
              when you were a kid, when the lessons of winning and losing 
              could have been learned at an early age, you might have...
     **Frasier:** DAD!
      **Martin:** All right.  Sorry, wrong time.  We'll talk about it tomorrow, 
              over breakfast.  Okay, Daphne.  Let's get you home, and soak 
              your feet in some hot Epsom Salts.
      **Daphne:** Oh, I have the life of a princess. [_they leave_]
        **Noel:** Don't feel bad, Roz. it's an honor just to get a nomination.
         **Roz:** Will you stop saying that?
        **Noel:** Okay.  I'm leaving.
         **Roz:** Oh Noel, I'm sorry, I'm just despondent. [_he waits, 
              expectantly_] ...No no, go ahead. [_waves him away_]
     **Frasier:** ROZ!
         **Roz:** Noel?  Noel?  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  I'll see you at work, 
              on Monday?
    _He shows her the thumbs-up sign and leaves.  Fletcher comes over._
    
    **Fletcher:** How you guys doing?
         **Roz:** Well, I've been better.
    
    _Niles enters, hands Fletcher a drink, then leaves._
    
    **Fletcher:** You know, when you feel this sting of losing, you have to 
              realize that it all boils down to the fact that it's not  
              about awards.  It's not about accolades.  It's about a body 
              of work.  If you can look at yourself in a mirror and say 
              you've done a good job, that's all that matters. If you can 
              do that, let the awards fall where they may. 
    
    _He leaves._
    
     **Frasier:** Wow.  All those nominations, nothing to show for it, he still 
              walks out of here with his head held high and a smile on his 
              face.
         **Roz:**[_bursting into tears_] I'm never going to get nominated for a 
              SeaBea again!
     **Frasier:** Oh, come on Roz.
         **Roz:** I mean it, I'm not!
     **Frasier:** Oh, no.
         **Roz:** The world is full of winners and losers, and I'm just a 
              loser!
     **Frasier:** Aw, I wouldn't be with you if you were a loser.  Come on, 
              we're a team.  Look, before we're done, we're gonna win lots 
              of these things.  You and I are amigos, compadres, okay?  Now 
              listen, I am not gonna leave your side until I see a little 
              smile on that face.
    
    _Tawny, Miss SeaBea, wanders toward Frasier._
    
       **Tawny:** Dr. Crane?  I really love your show, and I was just
              wondering, would you like to have a drink with me?
     **Frasier:**[_to Roz_] Do I see the beginning of a little smile?
         **Roz:** Oh, go ahead.
     **Frasier:** Thanks, Roz. 
    
    _He gets up and leaves with Tawny_ 
    
     **Frasier:** So, it's a very interesting name you have.
       **Tawny:** You mean Miss SeaBea?
     **Frasier:** Well actually, I, er... yeah.
    _End of Act Two._
    **Credits:**
    
    Roz and Fletcher's Mom are having a drink together.  When Roz has 
    another crying jag, Mom takes the opportunity to steal her drink._
