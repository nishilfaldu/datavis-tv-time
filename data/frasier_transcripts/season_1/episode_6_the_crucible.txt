    _Act One.  
    Scene A - Frasier's booth at KACL.  
    Frasier is on air._
    
    **Frasier:** You're listening to KACL 780 on your AM dial.  This is Dr.
             Frasier Crane.  All our lines are open, so please, give us 
             a call. [_silence_] I'm just sitting here waiting. [_silence_] 
             Hey, Seattle, c'mon, I know you're out there.  Hey, look, 
             I realise it's a sunny day but on all those rainy days, 
             I was there for you. [_silence_] Well, alright then, if 
             that's the way you want it, you leave me no recourse...
             [_clears his throat; singing_]
             "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie-" 
    
    _His board lights up._ 
    
    **Frasier:**_That_ seems to have gotten you going there, okay!  Alright 
             then, I knew you were out there.  Okay, Roz, who do we have?
        **Roz:** We have Gary from Issiqua on line two.  He and his wife had 
             a big fight.
    **Frasier:** Sorry to hear that, Gar.  I'm listening.
       **Gary:**[_v.o._] Well, y'see, Dr. Crane, my wife is hell-bent on going 
             to Italy this year.
    **Frasier:** Ahh, Italia - the rolling hills of Toscana, the art of 
             Firenze, the passion that is Venizia...
       **Gary:**[_over his head_] Yeah, well, anyway - I like taking vacations 
             as much as the next guy but I say that, if we dip into our 
             savings, I think the first thing we should buy is a new 
             sump-pump for the basement.  At least with that-
    **Frasier:**[_interrupting_] Oh, listen, Gary.  Let me stop you right
             there.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with your wife 
             on this one.
       **Gary:** But the trip to Italy costs eighteen hundred bucks, and that
             doesn't include the "Splendours of the Vatican" package.
    **Frasier:** Gary, there is more to life than sump-pumps.  Whatever 
             happened to feeding our souls?  Look, for example, I recently 
             purchased a painting by one of this country's premier artists--
             oh, it's not important who.  Well, it's Seattle's own Martha 
             Paxton, but... Practical?  No.  But ever since acquiring that 
             painting, I look at it every day and there's not a moment when 
             I do that I'm not uplifted by its beauty.  So Gary, go to 
             Italy, bring back a suitcase full of memories.  Will you do 
             that?
       **Gary:** I still think I should get the sump-pump.
    **Frasier:**[_contemptuous_] Well then, yes, Gary, you... you should get the 
             sump-pump!  We'll be right back after this newsbreak.
    
    _Frasier is now off-air and moves through to Roz in the control booth._
    
    **Frasier:** Roz, just what is a "sump-pump?"
        **Roz:** If you need one, you'll know.  Listen, do you really own a
             Paxton or were you just blowing sunshine up old Gary's skirt?
    **Frasier:** Yes indeed, I do own a Paxton.
        **Roz:** Well, you'll be pleased to know that she's on line three. 
             [_holds up the phone_]
    **Frasier:**[_gasps and snatches the phone_] My God, Roz, she's the 
             preeminent Neofauvist of the twentieth century!  How 
             could you put her on hold?
        **Roz:** Well, the phone rang and I pushed the little button-
    
    _He gestures for her to push the little button again._
    
    **Frasier:** Yes, hello, Miss Paxton.  I'm so sorry to have kept you 
             waiting.  Well, thank you.  I'm very flattered that you listen 
             to my little show.  Yes, well, yes, I meant every word.  Yes, 
             that's lovely, I'd like to meet you, too sometime. [_sudden 
             thought_] As a matter of fact, I'm having a few friends over 
             for a little gathering this Friday night, for cocktails and 
             such.  Well, I suppose you're far too busy to... you would!  
             Oh, that's marvelous.  Alright, that's the Elliot Bay towers 
             on the Counterbalance.  Around seven is just fine.  And, well, 
             I'll see then then.  _Ciao!_ [_hangs up_]
        **Roz:** I didn't know you were having a cocktail party.
    **Frasier:** That makes two of us!
    _FADE OUT_
    **WHAT A SWELL PARTY**
    
    _Scene B - Frasier's apartment, Friday night.  
    The cocktail party has started.  Martha Paxton's painting occupies a
    place of honor over the fireplace.
    
    Daphne is standing in the middle of a small clique, while the rest of 
    the party mingle around them.  Niles is seated on the stereo cabinet, 
    gazing at her adoringly._
    
    **Daphne:** Well, my theory on death is: first you're whisked down a long
            dark tunnel towards a beautiful white light; you suddenly get 
            all the jokes you never got before, you let out a little 
            chuckle, and then you die!
    
    _The clique laughs._
    
    **Frasier:** That's a delightful story, Daphne, but I think the toast 
             points need replenishing.
     **Daphne:**[_moving away_] Be right on it.
      **Niles:**[_hops down_] Enchanting, just enchanting.
    **Frasier:** My God, Niles, why is no-one eating the Mussoline of Duck?
    
    _Eddie hops onto the chair and starts eating it._
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, you mangy little cur! [_chases Eddie away_]
      **Niles:** Well, now we know why.
    
    _Frasier tidies up the duck and nervously licks his fingers clean._
    
    **Frasier:** Look, Niles, the dog is eating the food, the pianist is too
             intrusive, the Pinot Noir is far too stagey and it's five past 
             seven and Martha isn't even here yet!
      **Niles:** I'm not going to have to sedate you, am I?
    **Frasier:** No, I'm just a bit on edge, I want everything to be so 
             perfect. [_pause_] By the way, where's Maris?  I haven't 
             seen her all night.
      **Niles:** She's on your bed.
    **Frasier:** My bed?
      **Niles:** Yes, she's asleep under the guests' coats.  She exhausts 
             easily under the pressure to be interesting.
    **Frasier:** Niles, she's supposed to be looking after dad.  That's the 
             only reason you're here, remember?
      **Niles:** Dad is in the bathroom - don't worry.
    
    _Doorbell rings._
    
    **Frasier:** That must be la Paxton - and fashionably late, of course. 
    
    _He opens the door.  It's Roz._ 
    
    **Frasier:** Oh hi, Roz, it's you. [_she looks offended_] And you look 
             radiant.
        **Roz:** I look like crap - I've got a spot on my dress, I over-plucked 
             one eyebrow and the crotch of my pantyhose is creeping down to 
             my knees.
    
    _To Frasier's horror she squats behind the table next to the couch 
    and pulls them up._
    
    **Frasier:** Couldn't you have just done that in the elevator? [_takes her 
             coat_] Oh, my goodness, Roz, you've got a neck.  Gee, so what 
             do you think of the place?  Is it everything you imagined it 
             would be?
        **Roz:** Well, to be frank, Frasier, I don't spend my idle hours 
             imagining how you live.  But I did expect lots of beige 
             and, look, I was right.
    **Frasier:** Would you like a drink?
        **Roz:** Sure, something light would be nice.
    
    _Frasier calls the waiter over._
    
        **Roz:**[_to waiter_] Double bourbon, rocks, and spill a little in the
             glass.
    
    _In the Kitchen, Daphne is bent over, taking a tray out of the oven.  
    Niles sidles in, apparently innocently._
    
      **Niles:** Oh, Daphne, you're here, too.
     **Daphne:** My goodness, Dr. Crane - shouldn't you be out there mixing?
      **Niles:** Oh, don't mind me.  I'm just getting some ice. [_puts the ice
             to his forehead_]
     **Daphne:** Lovely party, isn't it?
      **Niles:** Yes, it is.
     **Daphne:**[_chopping herbs_] ook at this fresh fennel. [_picks up a piece 
             and sniffs it_] Smells wonderful, doesn't it?
      **Niles:**[_smelling Daphne's hair instead_] It certainly does.
     **Daphne:**[_catching Niles_] Dr. Crane, were you sniffing my hair?
      **Niles:** Why would I do a thing like that?  I'm a happily married man - 
             I love my Maris.
      **Guest:**[_entering kitchen_] Where should I put this coat?
      **Niles:** Just throw it on the bed.
    
    _In the lounge, people are still milling around._
    
        **Roz:** So, Frasier, which one is your dad?
    **Frasier:** Oh, well, he's the older gentleman over there talking to
             Bethany van Pelt, showing her the photographs. [_realises_]
             Oh my God!
    
    _He rushes over to them._
    
     **Martin:**[_re: photos_] ...and when we finally got to her it was only 
             hanging by two tendons.
    **Frasier:**[_to Bethany, who looks ill_] Would you excuse us, please? 
             [_leads his dad away_] Dad, will you stop showing these crime 
             scene photos?  You're embarrassing me.
     **Martin:** Oh, these society people eat this up.  Besides, she was the 
             one that brought it up.
    **Frasier:** Oh, she brought it up?  Bethany van Pelt - the head of the
             Junior League - brought up the subject of a hooker whose
             body was hideously dismembered and scattered all over an
             abandoned warehouse.
     **Martin:** Yeah, she asked, "aren't these Swedish meatballs the
             messiest things you've ever seen?" and I said, "no, 
             as a matter of fact"-
    **Frasier:** Dad, dad, please!
     **Martin:** Alright, alright, but stop shadowing me.  I don't need a
             nursemaid.
    **Frasier:** Alright, if you give me your word, that's good enough for
             me. 
    
    _He passes Niles, who is following Daphne out of the kitchen._
    
    **Frasier:**[_hits Niles_] You watch him!
    
    _As Frasier moves off, Niles would obviously prefer to stay with 
    Daphne, when Roz comes over to him._
    
        **Roz:** Hi, Niles.
      **Niles:** Oh, hello.
        **Roz:** You may not remember me, I'm-
      **Niles:** Of course I remember you.  Would you be a love and watch that 
             man with the cane? [_continues following Daphne_]
    
    _Doorbell rings.  Frasier answers - this time, it is Martha Paxton.  
    She is short, bald and aged around 50.  She wears a poncho which 
    covers her arms completely, and a Native American bead necklace._
    
     **Martha:** Dr. Crane?  I'm Martha Paxton.
    **Frasier:** Of course, who else could you be?  Welcome to my salon.
             [_loudly_] Everyone, everyone, your attention, please.  I'd 
             like you all to welcome our guest of honour, the renowned
             artist - Martha Paxton.
    
    _The guests applaud._
    
    **Frasier:** May I take your... poncho?
     **Martha:** No, no, no, no, I never take it off at parties.  It gives me
             an excuse not to shake hands with people.
    **Frasier:** Oh, how delightfully eccentric!  You must meet my brother,
             Niles.  Oh, Niles?
      **Niles:**[_moves over to the door_] Miss Paxton, Dr. Niles Crane.  It is 
             an honour to shake your hand. [_outstretches his hand then, 
             seeing no reaction on her part, shakes her poncho instead_]
             Well, to shake anything of yours is an honour. [_skulks away,
             embarrassed_]
     **Martha:** Now, where did you hang my painting?  I'm always curious to
             know how people live with my work.
    **Frasier:** "Live with my work" - I love that phrase.  If you would, right 
             this way, please. [_leads her towards the centre of the room_] 
             I think this is the perfect spot for an ideal viewing.  Oh 
             God, I've waited so long for this moment - I'm just going to 
             stand back and let you describe your work - "Elegy in Green"--
             in your own words.  The way you insinuate the palette but 
             never lean on it, you capture the _zeitgeist_ of our generation.  
             It is the most perfect canvas it has ever my privilege to gaze 
             upon.  I mean, one can only imagine what inspired you to paint 
             it.
     **Martha:** I didn't paint it.
    
    _A murmur passes through the crowd._
    
    **Frasier:**[_fighting panic_] Of course you didn't.  You-you created it, 
             you gave birth to it.
     **Martha:**[_walks to the painting_] I didn't do anything to it - I never 
             saw this _painting_ before in my whole life.
     **Martin:**[_leans into Frasier's ear_] And you thought I was gonna 
             embarrass you!
    
    _End Of Act One.
    
    Act Two.
    
    Scene C - Frasier's apartment, post-party.  Martin and Frasier are in 
    the lounge.  Daphne is cleaning up while Frasier just leans against 
    the pillar, staring at the painting._
    
     **Martin:** I really liked your friend Roz.  
    **Frasier:** What?
     **Martin:** Roz, at the party tonight.  Nice gal.  Why don't you ask her
             out?  She's great-looking and she can really hold her liquor.
    **Frasier:** Dad, do you mind?  I've just suffered the most humiliating
             evening of my life.  I've been been made a fool of by this,
             this, this... thing. [_gestures towards the painting_]
     **Daphne:** You know, I may be just a girl from Manchester but, I have to
             tell you, even though it's not a Paxton, I really like that 
             picture.  I liked it the minute I saw it.  I liked it even 
             before I knew who Martha Paxton was.  And quite frankly,
             I don't think that woman bathes.
    **Frasier:** Well, enjoy it while you can because, first thing in the
             morning, this is going back to the dealer where I bought it.  
             I'm demanding my money back - no-one is going to take 
             advantage of Frasier Crane.
     **Martin:** You know, listen, Frasier.  You're kind of upset about this,
             maybe I should return it for you.
    **Frasier:** Well, Dad, I appreciate the gesture but, really, what do you
             know about the art world?
     **Martin:** Apparently about as much as you do.
    _FADE TO:_
    **#$ &%*!!!**
    
    _Scene B - The Hayson Gallery
    Frasier is staring at a painting, he is approached by Phillip._
    
    **Phillip:** I can see the love in your eyes.  You must have this painting.
    **Frasier:** Are you the owner?
    **Phillip:** Yes, I am.  Phillip Hayson. [_they shake hands_]
    **Frasier:** How do you do, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  I happen - 
    **Phillip:** No, not _the_ Dr. Frasier Crane.  From the radio? 
    **Frasier:** Guilty.  Yes, but -       
    **Phillip:** My wife and I love your show!  Could I have your autograph 
             before you go?
    **Frasier:** It would be my pleasure but, speaking of autographs, I have a 
             small problem with this painting. [_holds up painting_]
    **Phillip:** I'm really distressed to hear that.  Would you like a glass of 
             wine?
    **Frasier:** Well, actually I -
    **Phillip:** My wife and I toured the Loire valley last year and we 
             couldn't resist buying four cases of this.  [_opens the
             bottle and pours Frasier a glass_] It's really quite
             extraordinary - I hope you like it. 
    **Frasier:** Well, I'd really rather not have any wine at this moment -
    
    _Phillip lets Frasier taste the wine._
    
    **Frasier:** Well, that's rather nice, isn't it?  Finishes well.  
    **Phillip:** Very well.  Would you like some more?
    **Frasier:** No, no, no, thank you.  I'd... getting back to my problem -
             I recently gave a small but elegant soiree at which Martha
             Paxton was in attendance, you see.  She told me that this
             painting was not her work. 
    **Phillip:** Oh dear, I can imagine how embarrassing that must have been.
    **Frasier:** I doubt you can, Mr. Hayson.
    **Phillip:** Please, Phillip.  Let's take a look at that in slightly 
             better light, shall we? [_walks the painting over to a stand
             and places it on the easel_] Oh, yes, I remember this - it's
             breathtaking.  [_Raising his voice_] Ronald, Diane, will you
             step in here a moment please? 
    
    _Two of Phillip's shills come through to join them, they gather 
    around the painting._
    
    **Phillip:** Do you remember when this piece was in the gallery - 
             everyone who saw it wanted it.  
      **Diane:** Yes, it's a very special piece.
     **Ronald:** Mrs. Chitcherelli was heart broken when it sold.
    **Phillip:** Oh, I remember - 
    **Frasier:** Yes, I'm sure she was but, you see, it's _not_ a Paxton!
    **Phillip:** But it says right here that it _is_ a Paxton.  The signature 
             is here. [_The three bend to point at the signature_]
    **Frasier:** Martha Paxton says that it is not a Paxton.
    **Phillip:** Oh, Martha, how is the old dear?  Her and I go back a long 
             way, is she still-? [_makes a gesture to his hair - a reference 
             to Paxton's baldness_]
    **Frasier:** As a Crenshaw melon, yes.
    **Phillip:** Would you like a little more wine?
    **Frasier:** No, I don't want any wine.  I want to discuss this painting.
    **Phillip:** So would I.  Maybe some brie? [_Ronald and Diane disappear_]
    **Frasier:** No, I don't want any brie!  I want my money back.
    **Phillip:** Oh, well, that's where things might get a bit... prickly. 
             You see, we have a strict policy here at the Hayson gallery -
             all sales are final.  
    **Frasier:** But, in this case, you're willing to make an exception.
    **Phillip:** Oh, I'd love to, but I can't.
    **Frasier:** Yes, but it's a forgery.
    **Phillip:** Well, if it is, it's a damn good one. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Alright, alright, I'm going to make this simple - I want my
             money.
    **Phillip:** I'm sure you do.
    **Frasier:** Oh, I know what you're doing - you're "handling" me.  You're
             agreeing with everything I say hoping I'll tire and go away.
    **Phillip:** Whatever you say.
    **Frasier:** I don't believe it!  You're shining me on.  You are shining
             me on!  Where is the fairness of this, where is the justice?!
    **Phillip:** Dr. Crane, if you ever find justice in this world, let me 
             know, will you?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
             [_walks away_]
    **Frasier:** What?  Did a crate of freshly-painted Rembrandts just arrive?! 
             [_follows him_] Damn it, you're not getting away with this!  
             I am not leaving.  I am not leaving!  I am NOT leaving.
    _FADE TO:_
    **AFTER HE LEFT...**
    
    _Scene C - Frasier's apartment.  
    Frasier arrives, with the painting, to find Martin eating at the dinner
    table._
    
     **Martin:** What are you still doing with that?  I thought you were going 
             to return it.
    **Frasier:** They wouldn't take it back.  All I got was some attitude and 
             a cheap glass of wine - Loire valley, my ass.
     **Martin:** What are you going to do now?
    **Frasier:** Well, they've forced my hand.  I'm going to call the police.
             [_picks up the phone_]
     **Martin:** Five-five-five three thousand.
    **Frasier:** Thanks, Dad.  Try to mess with Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll teach
             them. [_into phone_] Hello, yes.  Oh, just a second. [_to Martin_] 
             Dad, who do I ask for?
     **Martin:** Have them put you through to the fine arts forgery department.
    **Frasier:**[_into phone_] Hello, yes, the fine arts forgery department,  
             please. 
    _At the table, Martin hides his grin while Frasier gets a sour look._
    
    **Frasier:** Dad, they're laughing at me.
     **Martin:**[_chuckling_] Give me the phone. [_Frasier does_] Hi, who's this?  
             Hey, Doris.  Yeah, Marty Crane.  Yeah, that was my son.  Yeah, 
             I just thought he needed a bite of a reality sandwich.  Yeah, 
             yeah, give my best to the guys.  Thanks.  Bye. [_hangs up_]
    **Frasier:** What was that?
     **Martin:** Frasier, the boys downtown have their hands full of murders 
             and robberies - they don't have time for this artsy-fartsy
             stuff.
    **Frasier:** Yes, Dad, but what am I supposed to do?  I've been cheated!
    
    _Niles and Daphne emerge from Frasier's bedroom, both are disheveled 
    and appear straightening their clothes._
    
    **Frasier:** What were you two doing back there?
      **Niles:** Maris lost her earring at the party last night.  Daphne was
             good enough to crawl under the bed to look for it while I...
    **Frasier:**[_long and low_] Yeeeess?
      **Niles:** Searched the credenza!
     **Daphne:** Maybe I'll go check in the hallway.  It might have gotten
             trampled into the carpet when everybody stampeded for the
             elevator.
    **Frasier:** No one stampeded!  They were all just good guests, they knew 
             when to leave.
      **Niles:** Two hours early. [_laughs_]
    **Frasier:** Oh, shut up, Niles!
      **Niles:**[_sees the painting_] Oh, I see.  Am I to ascribe this foul mood 
             to the fact that you were unable to unload the bogus Paxton?
    **Frasier:** Yes.  Gee, I know, Niles.  What is the name of that really 
             vicious lawyer that you use?
      **Niles:** Which one, the one I used to sue the contractor or the one 
             I used to sue the personal trainer?
    **Frasier:** Well, the meanest.
      **Niles:** Uh, that would be the second one.  I used him to sue the 
             first one.
    **Frasier:** Right. [_picks up the phone_] Ah, just give me his number, 
             will you?
     **Martin:** Ah, forget it, Frasier.  Five years of litigation and you'll 
             end up paying eight times what you paid for the painting. 
             [_carries his plate to the kitchen_]
      **Niles:** He's right about that.
    **Frasier:**[_replaces the phone_] God, I hate laywers!
      **Niles:** Oh, me too. [_sits down on the couch_]  But they make wonderful 
             patients.  They have excellent health insurance and they 
             never get better.
    **Frasier:** Say, I know, I know.  I can use my radio show - why didn't I
             think of this earlier?  I can use my bully pulpit to expose
             that man for the fraud that he is!
      **Niles:** Now, Frasier, that's slander.  He'll sue you for everything
             you've got.
    **Frasier:** Damn it, Niles, where is the justice?  Where am I supposed to 
             turn to?  I'm a, a beloved household personality and I've been 
             screwed! [_gestures at the painting_]
     **Martin:**[_as he returns from the kitchen_] For God's sake, Frasier,
             you're forty-one years old.  It's time you learned something:  
             the system ain't perfect.  Sometimes the bad guy wins.  And 
             all those things you thought would be around to help you, 
             the courts and the police department?  Well, sometimes 
             they're just not there when you need them.  So you can either 
             let it eat a hole in your stomach, or you can just file it 
             away under the heading, "Sometimes Life Sucks." 
             [_exits to his room_]
    **Frasier:**[_shouts after him_] Yeah well, that file's getting pretty 
             thick!
    
    _Niles returns from the bar with two sherries.  He hands one to 
    Frasier._
    
    **Frasier:** So that's that, huh?  Hayson just gets away with it.  He's 
             sitting there now with his brie and his wine and his little 
             chuckle at my expense.  Gosh, you know, I finally understand 
             why people take matters into their own hands.  It would be so 
             satisfying right now to just... slash his tires, or... throw 
             a brick though his window or something.  Just so he'd learn 
             that you don't do this to people and get away with it.
      **Niles:** Yes, well, I know you, Frasier, and I know that you'd never
             resort to that sort of thing. [_looks at his brother, and 
             becomes unsure_] Would you, Frasier?
    
    _Silence._
    
      **Niles:** There's a vein throbbing in your forehead.
    
    _Daphne enters from the hallway._
    
     **Daphne:** Well, I couldn't find it in the hallway but let me give it
             one last try.  Could you give me the matching earring?  Maybe
             I'll get something from it.
    
    _Niles hands Daphne the earring.  She holds it in both hands and 
    concentrates._
    
     **Daphne:** Oh yes, I'm getting a feeling.  It's in your father's room.
             No, no, it's in Dr. Crane's room.  Oh, this is odd, now it's 
             in the hallway.
    
    _Eddie scampers in from the hallway and across the lounge._
    
    **Niles/**Daphne:**** Eddie!
    
    _Niles and Daphne run after Eddie while Frasier grabs his car keys 
    and exits the apartment.
    
    FADE TO:_
    
    **PEACHFUZZ**
    
    _Scene D - Outside the Hayson Gallery.  
    Frasier creeps round the corner, holding a brick.  He checks that the 
    coast is clear, then stands in front of the window and is about to 
    throw it until he notices an old couple walking past.  He hides the 
    brick behind his back._
    
    **Frasier:** Good evening.  Lovely night, isn't it?  Yes, well, goodnight.
    
    _Again, Frasier gets ready to throw the brick but this time a horn 
    honks and Niles's car pulls up in front of the gallery._
    
      **Niles:**[_through car window_] Get in the car.
    **Frasier:** Niles, what the hell are you doing here?
      **Niles:** Stopping you from doing something really stupid.  Now get
             in the car.
    **Frasier:** I will not!  Niles, look, I know this is wrong but I don't 
             care!  It's the only thing left for me!
      **Niles:** Alright, Frasier. [_steps out of the car; Frasier retreats_] 
             Frasier, just give me the brick and no one will get hurt.
    **Frasier:** Why don't you just go away?  This is no concern of yours.
      **Niles:** Yes, it is.
    **Frasier:** How?
      **Niles:** Remember that day in junior high school when somebody took
             all my clothes while I was in the shower, right after gym
             class?  They hung them from the goalpost on the football 
             field.  I had no choice but to get a ladder and climb up 
             there wearing nothing but a towel, wet and shivering.  Then 
             the towel fell off!  There I was - your little brother, 
             hanging naked from a goal post, and everyone was standing 
             around laughing, and all Coach Medwick would do was stand 
             there going- [_holds his arms up to imitate the gesture_] 
             whatever that means.
    
    [_N.B. In American football, the signal - raising the arms to vertical 
    and then dropping them to a "Y" position - means "field goal!" when a 
    player scores by kicking the ball over and through the goal post._]
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, why are you telling me this?
      **Niles:** Because - I was so humiliated, I went home, I cried my eyes
             out, I swore I would get even.  I was just about to put
             sugar into Coach Medwick's gas tank... and you stopped me.  
             Remember what you said?  "If you act like a barbarian, you 
             will become a barbarian."
    **Frasier:** I said that?
      **Niles:** Yes.  Well, actually you were more verbose at the time.  
             I had to listen, you were sitting on my chest.  
    
    _Pause._
    
      **Niles:** Give me the brick, Frasier.
    **Frasier:**[_frustrated_] And let him get away with this?!
      **Niles:** I know, I know!  What the gallery owner did to you was wrong, 
             it was humiliating.  But if you throw that brick through that 
             window, you will have lost something more valuable than your 
             money.  You will have lost... your mind.  Frasier, you can't 
             do this!
    **Frasier:** Well, Niles, if you were strong enough to show restraint
             after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames.
      **Niles:**[_as if remembering_] Nicknames. [_then:_] There were nicknames?
    **Frasier:** Oh, you didn't know that?  Oh dear God, yes.  Uh, "Peachfuzz,"
             "Jingle Bells" - I can't remember the rest.
      **Niles:** "Peachfuzz"?
    **Frasier:** Yes, I believe Coach Medwick made that one up himself. 
             [_hands Niles the brick_] Well, anyway, here you are.  
             I won't be needing this anymore.
      **Niles:** I'm proud of you.
    
    _Frasier heads towards the car but Niles does not join him.  Instead, 
    he cocks his arm and hurls the brick through the gallery window,
    shattering it with a loud crash.  As the alarm sounds, Niles throws 
    his hands up in a gesture reminiscient of the Coach Medwick signal._
    
    **Frasier:**[_shouts above the alarm_] My God, Niles!  What are you, what 
             have you done?!
      **Niles:**[_proud_] I've struck a blow for justice!  Nobody calls me
             "Peachfuzz."  Now let's get the hell out of here. 
    
    _They both run to the car, but as Frasier dashes to the passenger side, 
    Niles stops and runs back to the window with his wallet out._
    
    **Frasier:** Niles, what are you doing now?
      **Niles:** We may be barbarians, but we pay for our pillaging! 
    
    _He throws a handful of notes in through the broken window._
    
    **Frasier:** Come on, come on! [_Niles gets into the car_] GO, GO, GO, GO!
    
    _Niles's tires squeal as he speeds away from the gallery._
    
    _End Of Act Two._
    
    **Credits:**
    
    Frasier is contemplating the painting after hanging it on the wall.  
    The camera begins to zoom out and we discover that he's hung it above
    the cistern in the powder room.
